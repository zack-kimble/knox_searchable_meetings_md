| 2:36:21| So I agree with Council Member Parker's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| as it relates to the community advisory panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9385)|
| 2:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| I just wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| I agree with what Council Member Puget just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| which was some of the stuff that was spoken with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| when I talked to KUB representation and board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| What I like about the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| is it shines a spotlight on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| which these were concerns that were brought forth by SACE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| There's clearly a group of folks that are part of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| that feel like their opportunities are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| So we're shining a spotlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| and making sure that those concerns are heard and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| And so I appreciate everybody discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| And I appreciate SACE bringing them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| and KUB and the mayor collaborating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| on including some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| to make sure that those are illuminated in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| And for all of us to look at it deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| Also agree with Council Member Puget's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| and Council Member Ryder's as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| One thing I will say, we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| I do support the community advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| because they have done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| KUB has put these advisory boards together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| before they've been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| It's also been a way to get additional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| across this community engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| And I think all of us can be a part of that process too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| about people who can contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| And I'm also gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| and all of us have heard from a number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| dozens of employees with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| and they employ over a thousand people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| And I think all of the emails that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| and that you received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| that these are individuals that are on the front lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| They are listening to the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| of the residents of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| of our low income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| And most that we've heard from are long tenured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| which talks to me and tells me really great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| about the culture and the diversity of KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9524)|
| 2:38:45| And so I don't believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| they're throwing spaghetti at the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| to determine what the needs of our residents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| And they take great pride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| of being at the other end of a phone line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| or being boots on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| seeing what the needs of our residents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| And I've seen that, I've heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| And I just wanna be a positive voice for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| that have contributed so much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| and really take a great deal of pride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| about bringing solutions to the members of their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9557)|

| 2:43:03| there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| there's a push in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| to ensure that in addition to workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| that we're building ownership among the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| And so, as this program develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| and I know it targets a certain demographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| certain ages, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| but looking at ways to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| those trained through this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| to become independent contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| own their own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| what I'm hearing from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| is a part of the economic development strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| that they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9829)|

| 2:44:06| is a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=9846)|

| 3:00:50| They worked really hard and diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| to get this contract to you this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| The money was made available as of July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| and here we are July 28th with a negotiated contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| for your review and hopefully approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| This is a big contract with a lot of moving parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| and I appreciate their thoroughness and perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| in keeping us on target to bring this contract to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| so expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| This technology is something our officers want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| it's something our community wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| and even though body cameras and cameras are not a panacea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10882)|
| 3:01:27| it's a necessary step toward greater transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10887)|
| 3:01:32| and accountability within KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| in a way that we hope will help build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| even greater trust and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| between our officers and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| they hope to serve and protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| So any comments or questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10902)|
| 3:01:49| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| I had a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| During the budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| we were given a number for the body cams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10916)|
| 3:02:00| it's $124,000 one-time cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| and $620,000 per year leasing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10923)|
| 3:02:12| If we look at that over five years, that's $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10932)|
| 3:02:16| This proposal is $1.6 million over the budget conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| and did not include replacing the car video cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| So I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| One is, would passing this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10950)|
| 3:02:38| require us to increase the budgeted amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10958)|
| 3:02:42| already allocated for KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| I know you said the money was allocated July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| but there seems to be more than what was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| And the second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| why is there this need to replace the car dash cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10975)|
| 3:03:03| Mr. Evans, finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| would you speak to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10985)|
| 3:03:09| especially the first question was a budget question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| So could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| Yes, ma'am, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| Councilwoman Parker, we budgeted in the current FY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| that we're going to be spending $1.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| and we budgeted in the current FY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| that we just entered into a little over 700K for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11005)|
| 3:03:30| And we also had enough in what's called 706 replacement funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11010)|
| 3:03:39| that we had accrued to be able to cover the full cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| for year number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| which came to just over between 1.4 and 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11026)|
| 3:03:52| So we're good for FY 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| Now from FY 22 going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| actually it's gonna be like a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| just north of a million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| to pay for the video storage and all the rest of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| and the maintenance of it and everything going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| and those refreshes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| And we actually figured out that with the refreshing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| it was actually less expensive than it would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11065)|
| 3:04:32| had we not done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| As far as the need for the refresh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| I mean, I'm looking at the money aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| and why that's a good thing to keep it less expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11081)|
| 3:04:46| but as the need for the refresh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11086)|
| 3:04:48| I would defer to Ms. Penny Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| who I think is on the call with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| And by refresh you mean replace the dash cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| Yes, we are replacing both the dash cams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| the in-car cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| because it was just the time for their replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| reaching the end of their useful life and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| And then the body cameras was one of the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11117)|
| 3:05:21| with this contract, which we put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| and obviously we're choosing to exercise that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11124)|
| 3:05:33| Thank you, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11133)|
| 3:05:39| Any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| Just one other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| that the community has brought up around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| is wanting to know what the policy is gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| for use and public access to this footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11156)|
| 3:06:03| Getting answers to those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| is also one reason I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| this now including car and in-car and body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11170)|
| 3:06:16| because there's been some disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11176)|
| 3:06:24| or displeasure within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| of how and when we've had access to those in-car dash cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11187)|
| 3:06:34| So this was a new process with the body cams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| that would allow us to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| through a public process those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| Is there a commitment from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| to move forward with having a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| to develop those policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| One thing I would like to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| is that we follow what the laws are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| and the state of Tennessee on body worn cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| and how we share those videos publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| and protect people's privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| So I think Ron Mills is on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| from the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11227)|
| 3:07:07| and he has some expertise in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| that he could address those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| what the policies are and the laws on video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| and access to videos and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11238)|
| 3:07:21| Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| Yes, mayor, I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11243)|
| 3:07:24| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11246)|
| 3:07:27| There are two or three different considerations to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| Number one, first and foremost is always state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| There have been several attempts to amend state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| over the past couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| to deal specifically with access to body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| But at this point, the only thing dealing with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| is with regard to certain matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11264)|
| 3:07:46| that must be redacted for confidentiality sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11266)|
| 3:07:52| The Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| has long had a policy regarding its video systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11274)|
| 3:07:59| the in-car video systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| And when the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| when KPD actually tested several body worn camera systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11285)|
| 3:08:11| Chief Thomas put into effect a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| that governed the access to those cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| and essentially made those very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| to the in-car camera systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| I understand the council woman's concern about access issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| but I do have to point out also there's one other concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11305)|
| 3:08:29| and that is that the Knox County Criminal Courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11309)|
| 3:08:32| have placed an order that essentially governs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| all access to video as that is being potentially used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| for evidence in an ongoing criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| And that order specifically states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| that videos are not to be released to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| they're only gonna be available to counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| that's involved in that particular criminal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| either the DA's office or the defense council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| or the courts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| So we have those matters that we have to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11338)|
| 3:09:04| It's my understanding that the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| of the police department is to integrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| this temporary order that Chief Thomas put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| regarding body worn cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| into the regular video retention schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11355)|
| 3:09:21| and the retention and the general order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| for in-car cameras as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| It just makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Both of those systems are operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| off the same computer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| they're operating off the same storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11373)|
| 3:09:34| they're gonna be the same access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| So it makes sense to treat those essentially the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| Chief Thomas, could you speak to these questions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11383)|
| 3:09:50| particularly I think the CALEA standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| that you're already credited with and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11393)|
| 3:09:58| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| Everything that Mr. Mills said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| And also we use best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| and we have to comply with the CALEA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| the Commission on Accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| for Law Enforcement Agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| And so we did check with other accredited agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| and tried to mirror the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| that were acceptable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| So we wanted to make sure that we had good sound policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| to fall back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| Are those policies posted on the KPD website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11422)|
| 3:10:26| The in-car recording policy that covers the in-car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11426)|
| 3:10:31| or the recording policy is on the Open Records website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11431)|
| 3:10:37| The administrative memorandum we can put up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| that we used when we were testing the body cameras as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| I can get that put up there tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| It was in that original packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11445)|
| 3:10:46| that went out to council as well at the end of that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11446)|
| 3:10:49| So it's in there if you still have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11461)|
| 3:11:05| Sorry about that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| So not being familiar with what those laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| and those policies are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11469)|
| 3:11:10| In the event, I do wanna ask this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| that a complaint is filed with PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11473)|
| 3:11:17| does PARC have authority to be able to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| the body cam footage in the event of a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11483)|
| 3:11:30| I guess that would be directed to Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| I believe they do, Mr. Mills or Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11493)|
| 3:11:36| is that correct that the PARC could review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| and they wouldn't have the authority to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| but they could provide recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| if they saw something or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11504)|
| 3:11:48| Mr. Mills or Chief Thomas, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| PARC does have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| However, PARC is subject to the same limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| that everybody else is subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| with regard to access to the videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| during an ongoing criminal proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| So PARC would ultimately have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| to review the video, but under the court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| it would be contempt of court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11528)|
| 3:12:09| if any PARC members were allowed to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| during the pendency of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| But PARC could review just in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| how the policies and use and training on body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11542)|
| 3:12:23| before they become an issue where it's a legal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11543)|
| 3:12:27| just how they're used in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| I assume Chief Thomas has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| I know she's developed some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| and would follow the CALEA best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| and PARC could look at those and offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11559)|
| 3:12:44| you know, say it looks good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| or we suggest these potential changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11566)|
| 3:12:51| Would those be something you would be posting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| if this is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11574)|
| 3:12:55| You could post that in the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| As far as PARC looking at the current policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| Well, just sharing what the policies will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| once police body cameras are in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| You know, the officers need to know how they're used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11591)|
| 3:13:15| and, you know, all the things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| all these things that you've already developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| and are ready to go, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| the public and people want to know too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| so they know how it's being used and what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| And if it's not being used, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| in the ways that are consistent with that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| they could know, they would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| So how would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| Yes, Mayor, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| Yes, we intend to do a very comprehensive rollout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| when we start getting in these new cameras in car and body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11621)|
| 3:13:47| And of course, with the media and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| and we want to do a great demonstration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| as to how they work and what our policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| So yes, and PARC would be included in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11634)|
| 3:13:59| Vice Mayor, did you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11648)|
| 3:14:09| I don't remember if it was Mr. Mills or Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| who mentioned redacting portions of the footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11652)|
| 3:14:19| Can you go over that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11659)|
| 3:14:20| And if PARC would be able to see it before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| or only after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| PARC would be able to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| if it's redacted in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| The state law I'm specifically talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| is the Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| There are provisions and the redaction provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| I wouldn't think you'd find very onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| They're redaction of the images of juveniles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| particularly in a school setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| in some healthcare facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| and redactions of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| There are also things that by nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| have to be redacted from all videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11696)|
| 3:14:58| like social security numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| or any type of confidential information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11700)|
| 3:15:03| that might be recorded on that video as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11703)|
| 3:15:07| There's also obviously some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| about video that might be taken from body-worn cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11709)|
| 3:15:15| inside individuals' homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| when you may have some privacy issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| And that's one of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| that the General Assembly has looked at to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| And I think most police departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| have struggled with that over the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| in dealing with body cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| and that's something we'll certainly have to address as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| Any other discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11740)|
| 3:15:46| I just wanted to make a final comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| that it's difficult for me in these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| when there's something that the community wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11751)|
| 3:15:54| and so I want to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| but there's no justification given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| for a $300,000, $400,000 annual increase in cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11760)|
| 3:16:08| above and beyond what was anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| So I'm struggling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11773)|
| 3:16:14| I realize we have the money to pay for it this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11774)|
| 3:16:16| but it increases the cost for future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11776)|
| 3:16:21| And so, yeah, I just wanted to raise that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| I will likely vote in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| but I'm just dismayed that this is the culture of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| where we have no obligations to make commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| to the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| We have no obligations to stay within budgeted figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| And we're so easily able to raise the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11808)|
| 3:16:54| for this issue, $400,000, but on other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11814)|
| 3:17:02| it's much harder for us to find $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| So I just wanted to raise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| and push us to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| I would just say that this change in the budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| was response to the market and our RFP responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11835)|
| 3:17:20| don't always come back consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| with what we anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11842)|
| 3:17:23| Sometimes they're higher, sometimes they're lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| In this case, they were higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11846)|
| 3:17:27| That's certainly not anything any of us would prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| but this council and this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| and our law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| all have made body cameras a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11855)|
| 3:17:40| And this is why these costs are considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| and the change in cost is no trivial amount either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11863)|
| 3:17:48| And this is one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11868)|
| 3:17:49| why body cameras haven't been adopted in KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| for so long, because it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| But I think the community wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| I think this council already has said they want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| and I know KPD wants it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| So we don't get to set the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| It's a response to our request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| and we take the one that's the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| Well, I just have to clarify, as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| we would have had a heads up if we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| this was the year we needed to replace our in-car cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11896)|
| 3:18:22| So we did not have a discussion that this was the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| we needed to replace in-car cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| And the numbers for that was not discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| We've only discussed numbers for body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| So just that we were not given a heads up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| And that's why I see this being exponentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11918)|
| 3:18:41| more expensive than it would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| if we were only purchasing body cams right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| Well, I think I'll let Chief Thomas just speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| because I'm pretty sure we always said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11931)|
| 3:18:52| that the two were linked, the in-car cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| and the body cameras are sort of technologically connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| But Chief Thomas, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| Sure, and so it was the body cameras we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| the company we have in-car right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| that company has been sold two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| That technology is very outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11949)|
| 3:19:12| We actually started the process to replace those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| and do an RFP back in, I think it was early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11955)|
| 3:19:20| We'd worked with Janet Wright in tech services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| to get that RFP together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| So that RFP actually went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| It went out in, I think it was November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| or maybe early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| And it had an option should council vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| to add body worn to it, but the in-car needed to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| It was on a replacement schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| And Mr. Evans could probably speak more to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| but we will be saving some money where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| the way this system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| we're not gonna have to have a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11987)|
| 3:19:48| We're not gonna have to have remote access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| on our building for downloading and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| that we'll be saving money there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| So I know there's more of a cost that you see up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11996)|
| 3:19:59| but also there's a savings to go into digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| and uploading to a cloud immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| And also security as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| as far as there won't be any process of handling that video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| it would be uploaded immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| Ma'am Boyce here, if I could just make a follow-up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12012)|
| 3:20:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12018)|
| 3:20:18| A lot of times the things, matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| most of the things that we end up buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| with our replacement dollars, $706,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12024)|
| 3:20:29| I mean, those don't necessarily end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| like it's a new buy in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| For instance, if we're gonna buy four dump trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12037)|
| 3:20:42| and the money has been accruing over time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12042)|
| 3:20:48| you know, we've already got the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12048)|
| 3:20:51| we're ready to do it through those 706 replacement dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| So you wouldn't necessarily see the four dump trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12055)|
| 3:21:00| as some sort of, that would actually be a capital item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12060)|
| 3:21:05| in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| And I think those in-car cameras are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| no, I think, I know that's analogous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| to what I just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| I hope that helps a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12076)|
| 3:21:19| Thank you, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| Ms. Singh, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| If I may, if you can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| but I believe one of the other reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| why the price was slightly higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| is actually because of the holster trigger amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| And to me, it's related to the qualities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12098)|
| 3:21:44| that this particular contract offers that we didn't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12104)|
| 3:21:47| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| I don't want to misspeak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| We added that in that we felt like anytime an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12113)|
| 3:22:01| had to pull their revolver or whatever weapon they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12121)|
| 3:22:05| from their holster, that camera ought to kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| And yes, that up the price a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| I don't have the line by line amount in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| but yes, that was something that we opted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| which was not part of their basic proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12141)|
| 3:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12148)|
| 3:22:29| Thank you for the clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| Any further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12152)|
| 3:22:36| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12156)|
| 3:22:46| I'm sorry, I was muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| Councilman Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12167)|

| 3:23:20| I'm looking forward to adding these to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12200)|
| 3:23:26| Okay, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12206)|

| 3:23:34| for a pilot program to strengthen law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12214)|
| 3:23:37| and behavioral health partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| and ensure public safety and continuity of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| for those in behavioral health crises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12222)|

| 3:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12238)|
| 3:23:59| Motion made to approve by Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12239)|
| 3:24:03| seconded by Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| Council Members, I just want to, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| thank Houston Smeltzer is here from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12248)|
| 3:24:12| and some other people from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| And of course, Chief Thomas is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| to provide some of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| about how this concept originated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| and the research behind this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| I've read a little bit about it from various sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12264)|
| 3:24:27| including the National League of Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| that had some information about other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12269)|
| 3:24:32| that have tried this model as part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| you know, just another tool in the toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| to improve public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| I just also thank Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| for their partnership with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| that's been going on for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| This pilot is something that Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| has been working toward with KPD for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| It builds on successful partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| to promote early diversion away from incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| And it's based on successful initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| from around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12302)|
| 3:25:03| So I'm excited to bring this forward to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| but I want to emphasize that this is no way intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| as a be-all end-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| This is an alternative strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| to traditional criminal justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| but just one strategy to help address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| mental and behavioral health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| And it's a first step, a pilot that we hope to learn from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12321)|
| 3:25:25| and grow from the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12325)|
| 3:25:29| and continue to seek to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| So I would appreciate your support on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| and welcome the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| Mayor, would we like to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| with the speakers that have signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| Let me pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| The first person signed up to speak in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| is Leigh Ann Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12354)|
| 3:25:56| Ms. Hilliard, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12356)|
| 3:26:05| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12366)|
| 3:26:07| So Ms. Hilliard, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12367)|
| 3:26:10| You can start please by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12370)|
| 3:26:12| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12372)|
| 3:26:14| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12374)|
| 3:26:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| My name is Leigh Ann Heumann Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| I work as the Clinical Vice President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| for the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12380)|
| 3:26:22| 201 West Springdale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12384)|
| 3:26:28| I wanted to go ahead and start by why we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12388)|
| 3:26:32| that there is a need for a co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| And if you allow, I'd like to take a brief moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| to describe what I see currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| And it's not an exhaustive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| but hopefully it can provide a little bit of a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| Knoxville is really fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| to have several community providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| and behavioral health providers, including McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12414)|
| 3:26:58| that are community-based in their service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| So for us at McNabb, what that really means is a philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| that services are provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12425)|
| 3:27:08| when we can provide the services to the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| and family where they reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12432)|
| 3:27:13| And that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| We believe that services need to be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12435)|
| 3:27:18| beyond the walls of traditional outpatient offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12438)|
| 3:27:21| So it's important that you're going into the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| into the schools, into the hospitals and jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12443)|
| 3:27:26| And this is happening across our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| from all of these providers on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12448)|
| 3:27:31| And that approach, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| reduces a lot of traditional barriers to treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| because the clinician is going to the individual in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12457)|
| 3:27:41| So also in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| and I've heard that there was some questions about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| is the mobile crisis teams that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| So the mobile crisis team's function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12469)|
| 3:27:53| is to perform assessments for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12473)|
| 3:27:56| who are in a psychiatric crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12476)|
| 3:27:59| who are really in need for the voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| or an involuntary commitment to a psychiatric level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| And so that's only for individuals who have TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| or who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| That is really a two-hour expected response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| So it is not a service that is provided immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| And we do that for a five-county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| And again, it's for people who are in need of an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12502)|
| 3:28:25| and certification for hospitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12505)|
| 3:28:28| And most of that work is in the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| And in Knoxville, we also have places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| we're lucky to have places where people can be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| Can do a hospitalization or jail diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| But again, that's somewhere that an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| would have to go to that are experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| a mental health or substance abuse issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| And we've added those recently in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| with the city support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12531)|
| 3:28:54| However, there are times when an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| will not be engaged in services for a variety of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12537)|
| 3:29:02| or existing services are not meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| that individual's need at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| And law enforcement, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12548)|
| 3:29:10| is called and is the first to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| And in those situations is when we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| that we as a community have a gap in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| to meet the needs of individuals in real immediate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| So a solution that we would believe would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| was to pair law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| with a mental health professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| at that time of the encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| So we're not delaying services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| they don't have to refer to a service or call for a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| And so that model is pairing law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| with a mental health professional immediate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12578)|
| 3:29:42| which is our co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| So it would be a trained CIT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| crisis intervention trained, a team trained officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12587)|
| 3:29:51| and a mental health provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12591)|
| 3:29:52| who's trained in community-based services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12592)|
| 3:29:55| crisis experience, providing services in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12595)|
| 3:29:59| And we're providing right along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12599)|
| 3:30:00| with the law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| to do assessment, triage, and facilitate to treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12602)|
| 3:30:06| And we're going on those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| for the mental health calls with the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12608)|
| 3:30:10| So there's no waiting for other systems to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| It's 40 hours a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| and we would also provide training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| and be embedded within KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| So we're hoping that in and of itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12621)|
| 3:30:22| will increase a lot of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| about behavioral health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| It's a pilot, as we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| I think data tracking and reviewing of outcomes is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12628)|
| 3:30:32| We need to make adjustments as we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12632)|
| 3:30:34| based on experience from law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| and the mental health professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12638)|
| 3:30:39| but of course, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| from the individuals and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| who are served by this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| And in closing, I'd just like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| that McNabb has a long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| of advocating and serving individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| who are really involved in the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| And we have partnered with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| by creating a variety of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| and providing training such as CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12659)|
| 3:31:02| But our ultimate goal is to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12662)|
| 3:31:04| in need of access to care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| and decriminalize mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| And we believe this model gets us closer to that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12673)|
| 3:31:20| Thank you, Ms. Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12680)|
| 3:31:21| The next person speaking in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| signed up to speak in favor of this is Dr. Karen Sowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12684)|
| 3:31:28| Dr. Sowers, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12688)|
| 3:31:33| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12693)|
| 3:31:34| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12694)|
| 3:31:34| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12694)|
| 3:31:35| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12698)|
| 3:31:40| My name is Karen Sowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| I live at 9725 Franklin Hill Boulevard, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12702)|
| 3:31:49| I am a clinical social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| with over 37 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| I'm an educator, recently retired as Dean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| after 20 years at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| College of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| I have experienced myself in working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| as a clinical social worker with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12728)|
| 3:32:11| in the child abuse and sexual abuse field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12731)|
| 3:32:15| So this is an issue which I'm quite passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12735)|
| 3:32:21| I have spent over 37 years knowing of too many instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12741)|
| 3:32:30| where mentally ill persons who have been killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12750)|
| 3:32:35| by law enforcement for the lack of patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12755)|
| 3:32:39| empathy, de-escalation techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| and crisis intervention practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12762)|
| 3:32:46| These are instances where deaths did not need to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12766)|
| 3:32:50| nor did harm need to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| Clinical social workers are trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| in crisis intervention, de-escalation technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| We use patience to resolve situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12781)|
| 3:33:05| and sometimes law enforcement just doesn't have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12785)|
| 3:33:11| to play out those volatile situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12791)|
| 3:33:17| The use of social workers in law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12797)|
| 3:33:20| is more likely to decriminalize the mentally ill person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12800)|
| 3:33:27| Law enforcement has very little knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| or expertise to determine if illegal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12809)|
| 3:33:33| should be the primary concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| or whether there is truly a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| for mental health treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| A person who appears to be mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| to a mental health professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12824)|
| 3:33:46| may not seem so to a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| And this is because of our training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| and our expertise and our experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| Reviews show that there is less criminalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12836)|
| 3:34:00| and better outcomes for mentally ill persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12840)|
| 3:34:04| when a social worker or a mental health professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| is paired with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12848)|
| 3:34:13| The project that has been proposed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| from Helen Ross McNabb is based on sound evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12855)|
| 3:34:21| good sound science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12861)|
| 3:34:25| So they have looked at the data from SAMHSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12865)|
| 3:34:31| which provides a guide to help local systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12871)|
| 3:34:34| use data to implement crisis response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12874)|
| 3:34:40| That's very important when launching a brand new program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12880)|
| 3:34:45| that you don't just use what you think might work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12885)|
| 3:34:50| but that you base your project in science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12890)|
| 3:34:53| and then you track your outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| So SAMHSA has looked at all of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12896)|
| 3:35:02| across the country and has recognized that those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12902)|
| 3:35:08| which use response teams have been able to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12908)|
| 3:35:13| connections to resources for the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| They've been able to reduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| repeat encounters with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12919)|
| 3:35:23| They've been able to minimize arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12923)|
| 3:35:26| and they've been able to reduce the use of force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12926)|
| 3:35:29| in encounters with people who have mental health needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| I would strongly suggest that should you adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| this project as a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| that those be some of the major variables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12940)|
| 3:35:43| which are tracked over time by this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| and can be honed to be more effective over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12947)|
| 3:35:52| as we look at the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12952)|
| 3:35:54| I strongly encourage you to consider this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12954)|
| 3:35:58| I would hope that we will no longer have incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12958)|
| 3:36:03| of mentally ill persons who are killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| at the hands of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12966)|
| 3:36:09| Not only is this tragic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| but it's tragic for the law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| A clinical social worker can be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| not only for the mentally ill person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| but for the officer as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| who is experiencing their own issues with what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12981)|
| 3:36:27| Thank you very much for allowing me to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| And again, I hope you will strongly consider this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12991)|
| 3:36:36| Thank you, Dr. Sowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| That is the two people signed up to speak for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| We have several people signed up to speak against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| and calling them, the first person is Sarah Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13008)|
| 3:36:54| Ms. Hawkins, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13017)|
| 3:36:58| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13018)|
| 3:36:59| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13020)|
| 3:37:01| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13021)|
| 3:37:04| My name is Dr. Sarah Hawkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| and my address is 2018 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13026)|
| 3:37:11| I am a licensed clinical psychologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| I work with folks experiencing mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| substance use, homelessness, and chronic illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| And I'm speaking today against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13040)|
| 3:37:24| And I wanna share my specific concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13044)|
| 3:37:26| with a co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13046)|
| 3:37:28| I wanna start by saying that I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| with some of what Dr. Karen Sowers just told you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13051)|
| 3:37:34| but I have serious reservations with her conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13054)|
| 3:37:38| A co-response team makes it more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13058)|
| 3:37:41| for social workers to serve people in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| If an armed police officer and a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| step out of a vehicle together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| that partnership is hard to dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13070)|
| 3:37:53| And asking people in crisis to divulge information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13073)|
| 3:37:57| about substance use, mental health history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13077)|
| 3:38:01| and homelessness in front of an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| is simply asking too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| People in crisis need to be able to trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| that what they say can't and won't be used against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13089)|
| 3:38:13| That's the difference between healthcare providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| like social workers, nurses, and EMTs, and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| A response team will have a disproportionate negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13102)|
| 3:38:27| on our black and brown neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| folks who are LGBTQ, sex workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| and people experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| people who already experience stigma and discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13115)|
| 3:38:40| This co-response team will re-traumatize these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| who have already experienced significant trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| Some of the people this program would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| have had negative experiences with police before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13130)|
| 3:38:53| Some of them have been put in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| because they were dealing with substance use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| mental health crises, or simply because they have no home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13137)|
| 3:39:02| As I said to you last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| traumatic experiences change the way our brain works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13144)|
| 3:39:09| It causes a person to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13149)|
| 3:39:12| in a near constant state of hyper arousal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13152)|
| 3:39:16| that fight or flight or freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| Think about how you feel when you get pulled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| Your mind races, you feel nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| Now multiply that by 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| and you might be able to imagine the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13167)|
| 3:39:31| of someone who's lived through significant trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| Would you be effective in advocating for yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| and being calmed down if you got pulled over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| on the worst day of your life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| Mental health providers are experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| in helping deescalate every manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| not every manner, but all manner of crises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| related to what we're discussing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13191)|
| 3:39:55| Would you rather have a police officer approach you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13195)|
| 3:39:58| or somebody you loved when they were hallucinating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| Would you rather have a mental health provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| approach them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| I would pick the mental health provider every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| People who need our help are not inherently dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13209)|
| 3:40:13| Living with PTSD or schizophrenia or bipolar disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| or substance use or not having a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13218)|
| 3:40:22| does not make you dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| It makes you vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| We are not saying that mental health providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| should take the place of police in all situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| But to me, these scenarios seem to be very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13234)|
| 3:40:38| within the scope of a social worker's practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13238)|
| 3:40:42| And it seems to be on the job training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13242)|
| 3:40:44| if we're lucky for some police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13244)|
| 3:40:48| I'm not saying there aren't examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13248)|
| 3:40:50| of exceptional stellar police officers in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13250)|
| 3:40:55| but they are still not trained mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13255)|
| 3:40:59| And putting a social worker side by side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| with a police officer is going to make it more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13261)|
| 3:41:05| for that social worker and other mental health providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| to do their jobs, helping our neighbors who are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13268)|
| 3:41:11| Thank you, I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| Thank you, Ms. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13276)|
| 3:41:17| The next person signed up to speak is Amelia James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13277)|
| 3:41:22| Ms. James, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13286)|
| 3:41:28| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| My name is Amelia James, 900 East Hill Ave, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| I'm a licensed social worker here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13298)|
| 3:41:42| I do want to amplify some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| that Helen Ross McNabb said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| The social worker, and I'm sorry, I didn't catch her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13307)|
| 3:41:50| She said, law enforcement has very little knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13310)|
| 3:41:53| or expertise to know if criminal activity is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| She also said a person who appears mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13316)|
| 3:41:59| to a social worker may not seem so by a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13319)|
| 3:42:04| Helen Ross McNabb also said that they want to decriminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13324)|
| 3:42:07| people who have mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13327)|
| 3:42:08| So maybe if social workers are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| who have the required skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| and our goal is to decriminalize mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| maybe we need to remove police from the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| Certainly something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| But that aside, I do want to address a few concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| about how this pilot program is being structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| from an implementation science perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13348)|
| 3:42:31| So this proposed pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| will gather very specific data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| on one police and social worker dyad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13355)|
| 3:42:38| This data will likely not be generalizable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13358)|
| 3:42:41| and won't give us any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13361)|
| 3:42:44| about what it would be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13364)|
| 3:42:45| to have a true alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| without police presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13368)|
| 3:42:50| It's a very narrow pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| I do want to contrast this with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13373)|
| 3:42:56| the chief of police in Denver took with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13376)|
| 3:42:59| when trying to figure out the best option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| for an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| Denver actually currently has a co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13383)|
| 3:43:07| that was set up by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| where police and social workers respond to calls together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13389)|
| 3:43:12| However, the new chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13392)|
| 3:43:14| was inspired by the CAHOOTS model in Eugene, Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| where they have a separate response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| that's separate from police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13400)|
| 3:43:22| So the Denver chief of police initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| these conversations with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| and Denver actually voted for the CAHOOTS style model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13406)|
| 3:43:30| in a public ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| even though they already have a co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| So the Denver STAR program is based off CAHOOTS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| and they are in the midst of a six month pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13419)|
| 3:43:43| So the chief of police there says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| we had a lot of stakeholders at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| folks that are supportive of the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| and those who are not the biggest fan of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13429)|
| 3:43:52| We saw the value of a program like CAHOOTS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13432)|
| 3:43:55| and worked to figure out how we could get it going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| including funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| A group of Denver medics added that they insist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| that a program like this must be community owned and led.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13442)|
| 3:44:06| In Denver, they work, so they took up this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| with members from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13449)|
| 3:44:10| community-based organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13450)|
| 3:44:12| dealing with homelessness and drug addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| Denver's Black Lives Matter chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| parents of children who have had bad experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13456)|
| 3:44:19| with law enforcement, city council members and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13459)|
| 3:44:22| So like CAHOOTS, the STAR program in Denver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13462)|
| 3:44:25| uses the van-based system of a paramedic clinician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13465)|
| 3:44:30| As is the case in Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13470)|
| 3:44:31| team members do not have law enforcement powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| and do not make arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| The trial phase is focused on downtown Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| And the chief of police said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13478)|
| 3:44:40| I have police officers asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| how can we get more coverage from STAR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| We see what it's doing in the pilot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| and we want more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13486)|
| 3:44:48| So from an implementation science perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| the best way to start a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13492)|
| 3:44:55| is to do what the chief of police in Denver did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| get community members and stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| with lived experience at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13499)|
| 3:45:02| Additionally, they consulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13502)|
| 3:45:04| with existing alternative response programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| to understand how those programs work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| and how they could adapt it for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13508)|
| 3:45:11| I've spoken to some of you and you disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| that there hasn't been significant community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| You believe that many organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| community members and stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| were involved in the creation of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13521)|
| 3:45:24| If that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13524)|
| 3:45:25| that information has not been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| So lack of transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| with how this pilot program was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| has already led to some community mistrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13531)|
| 3:45:34| So our alternative proposal is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| that we would use this $95,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| to hire one full-time and one part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| either a social worker or public health professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13541)|
| 3:45:45| to gather input from our Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13545)|
| 3:45:48| prioritizing black, indigenous and people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13548)|
| 3:45:51| community-led organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| mental health and substance use treatment providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| legal experts and people with lived experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| So this dyad could actually consult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13559)|
| 3:46:02| with other programs across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| and understand different types of models of a response team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13564)|
| 3:46:07| not just a co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13567)|
| 3:46:10| This dyad could also explore funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| and what needs to logistically happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13573)|
| 3:46:14| in terms of training and supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13574)|
| 3:46:16| to implement a community-supported response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13576)|
| 3:46:19| even next summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13579)|
| 3:46:20| One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13580)|
| 3:46:21| So I know it can be really tempting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| to vote for a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| that feels like it's gonna start doing something right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| but we do ask you all to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| what the cost might be of implementing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13589)|
| 3:46:32| that has, it's very limited in the data it will collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13592)|
| 3:46:36| and has been created without community support and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13599)|
| 3:46:42| Thank you, Ms. James, or Dr. James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13602)|
| 3:46:46| The next person, the third person speaking against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13606)|
| 3:46:50| is Mary Hansen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13610)|
| 3:46:51| Ms. Hansen, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13611)|
| 3:46:59| Mary Hansen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13619)|
| 3:47:00| Mary, or excuse me, Mayor, I don't see that she is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13620)|
| 3:47:07| We could go to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| Well, she's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13629)|
| 3:47:10| but there's room for one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13630)|
| 3:47:12| The next person on the list is Ashley Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13632)|
| 3:47:16| Ms. Booth, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13636)|
| 3:47:22| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13646)|
| 3:47:27| If you can change your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13647)|
| 3:47:28| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| Sure, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13650)|
| 3:47:31| My name is Ashley Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13651)|
| 3:47:32| I live at 302 East Scott Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13652)|
| 3:47:39| I just wanted to say thank you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| for taking the time to listen to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13660)|
| 3:47:43| but I want to urge you today to vote no on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13663)|
| 3:47:48| I ask that you do not authorize this pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13668)|
| 3:47:53| for a co-responder team between a social worker and the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13673)|
| 3:47:57| I have several concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| and obviously some mental health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| spoke before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13683)|
| 3:48:04| I'm not a mental health professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13684)|
| 3:48:06| but I do see the flaw in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| that there are only two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| This is a very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13691)|
| 3:48:14| the scope of this is very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13694)|
| 3:48:16| and I don't believe that it would provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13696)|
| 3:48:20| an accurate idea of how effective this could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13700)|
| 3:48:24| So one of my main concerns is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13704)|
| 3:48:29| this was introduced about five days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| and as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13712)|
| 3:48:34| there has not been very much community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13714)|
| 3:48:38| A program like this really relies on community trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13718)|
| 3:48:41| and as of right now, there's a severe lack of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13721)|
| 3:48:47| and that certainly does not build trust within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13727)|
| 3:48:52| So when we're thinking about serving this specific community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13732)|
| 3:48:56| people with behavioral health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13736)|
| 3:48:58| and a lot of people before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| have talked about decriminalizing mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| I am deeply concerned about the presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13743)|
| 3:49:07| of a law enforcement officer in these incidences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| and the idea that having an armed law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13750)|
| 3:49:15| just further perpetuates the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| that folks suffering from behavioral health crises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| are inherently dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13760)|
| 3:49:23| when in fact, the presence of a law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| is generally what increases the potential for danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13767)|
| 3:49:32| So the Treatment Advocacy Center found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13772)|
| 3:49:35| that people with untreated mental illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| are 16 times more likely to be killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13778)|
| 3:49:41| during a police encounter than other civilians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| and a study published by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| the American Journal of Preventative Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13786)|
| 3:49:49| estimated that between 20 and 50% of fatal encounters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13789)|
| 3:49:53| with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| involved individuals with a mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| So as people have said before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13798)|
| 3:50:00| that a lot of people in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13800)|
| 3:50:01| have also had encounters with the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13801)|
| 3:50:05| and I would probably venture a guess to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| that there is a profound lack of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13807)|
| 3:50:10| between these two communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13810)|
| 3:50:12| So I'm not entirely sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13812)|
| 3:50:13| that having an armed law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13813)|
| 3:50:17| in conjunction with a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13817)|
| 3:50:18| would do much to actually help this individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13818)|
| 3:50:22| because at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13822)|
| 3:50:24| what we really want to see is a path towards harm reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13824)|
| 3:50:28| We want to see a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13828)|
| 3:50:29| that genuinely serves this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13829)|
| 3:50:32| and addresses some of the root causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13832)|
| 3:50:36| and something better for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| Licensed social workers, mental health advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| they have lots of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| and training in crisis intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| Police, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13850)|
| 3:50:52| are not trained in mental health matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| and are historically poor at de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13855)|
| 3:50:59| I really think that we need to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13859)|
| 3:51:03| having a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13863)|
| 3:51:06| at this incident with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13866)|
| 3:51:08| and as well, I wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13868)|
| 3:51:10| that this type of program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| would disproportionately affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13872)|
| 3:51:15| black and brown communities, people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| LGBTQ, homeless communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13877)|
| 3:51:21| So I'm not entirely sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| that this would be an effective program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| but thank you guys for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13886)|
| 3:51:30| Thank you, Ms. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13890)|
| 3:51:33| Council, that concludes the public speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13895)|
| 3:51:36| I just want to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13896)|
| 3:51:37| I mean, when I hear those speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13897)|
| 3:51:40| I hear a lot of common ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13900)|
| 3:51:41| that people want to decriminalize mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13901)|
| 3:51:47| and make sure that we serve our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13907)|
| 3:51:52| and redirect people away from prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| and the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13914)|
| 3:51:56| when they're having a mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13916)|
| 3:51:58| and I wholeheartedly support that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13918)|
| 3:52:02| I think our KPD officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13922)|
| 3:52:04| have had some considerable success with de-escalation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13924)|
| 3:52:09| not perfect, and this is why I'm proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13929)|
| 3:52:12| this pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| It has been developed over a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13934)|
| 3:52:19| It's just coming to you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13939)|
| 3:52:20| because it just takes a while to get these things going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13940)|
| 3:52:25| but I just want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| these conversations are part of why we want to do a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| so we can see what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13950)|
| 3:52:31| It doesn't preclude us from also considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13951)|
| 3:52:35| expanding a co-response model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13955)|
| 3:52:36| or also exploring an autonomous response model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13956)|
| 3:52:42| where social workers go out in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13962)|
| 3:52:46| that is like the COOTS-type model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| that has been successful in Eugene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13968)|
| 3:52:51| So I welcome your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13971)|
| 3:52:54| and also just want to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| remind you that people here from Houston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13976)|
| 3:52:59| Helen Ross McNabb, and of course Chief Thomas is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13979)|
| 3:53:03| to answer questions about it from KPD's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13986)|
| 3:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| And I also want to thank all the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13990)|
| 3:53:11| that took time to dial in and talk to us this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13991)|
| 3:53:15| and everyone who offered their feedback to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| the last couple of days to a week regarding this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=13998)|
| 3:53:24| More social workers is one of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| that I think all council members have heard for some time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| that there was a great need to have more social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14010)|
| 3:53:35| working in conjunction with KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| because we all know that absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| they are not mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| However, they are put in positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| when they answer those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| that they're dealing with those types of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14025)|
| 3:53:50| So one of the things that I would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14030)|
| 3:53:53| I don't know if we can explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14033)|
| 3:53:54| but I would like to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14034)|
| 3:53:56| I do absolutely agree that that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| very intimidating to a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14038)|
| 3:54:01| a normal person without mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14041)|
| 3:54:04| to be dealing with a police officer in their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| or coming toward them and they're just in a crisis period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14047)|
| 3:54:12| but a person with mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14052)|
| 3:54:13| absolutely that can exacerbate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14053)|
| 3:54:16| whatever is going on with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14056)|
| 3:54:18| So if there's a possibility that we could consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14058)|
| 3:54:21| a plain clothes officer in an unmarked car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14061)|
| 3:54:26| if that could help to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14066)|
| 3:54:29| Also, I do agree, Mayor, that this is a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14069)|
| 3:54:32| We would evaluate this as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14072)|
| 3:54:35| I do think it's a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14075)|
| 3:54:37| And I will challenge all of us that at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14077)|
| 3:54:41| I do think that we are going to have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14081)|
| 3:54:45| programs such as cahoots that will deal more with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14085)|
| 3:54:49| that are in the streets and our homeless population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| because we continue to see our homeless population grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| especially through this COVID crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| We continue to see them congregating more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| We know that there are a lot of people in those demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14100)|
| 3:55:05| that are suffering from mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| And a lot of those folks are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14107)|
| 3:55:09| chronically mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| without taking medication regimens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| And so I'm gonna challenge all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14113)|
| 3:55:15| as we move forward to keep an open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| as we see what the data brings back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| But I think we're gonna be faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| with some very major challenges down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14123)|
| 3:55:26| that we're gonna have to address as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| as it relates to our homeless and mental health population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14133)|
| 3:55:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14134)|
| 3:55:38| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14143)|
| 3:55:43| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14143)|
| 3:55:44| Yeah, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| Yes, I want to thank all of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14145)|
| 3:55:48| That was very good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| There was a lot of common ground there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| And just because hopefully we pass this measure tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14153)|
| 3:55:59| I don't want it to be viewed as this is all we're gonna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14159)|
| 3:56:03| All the programs that some of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14163)|
| 3:56:07| who were questioning this measure are good programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14167)|
| 3:56:11| And I see them as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| we could possibly supplement this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14173)|
| 3:56:16| We're not doing enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| We're not doing nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| And I'll make a comment about the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14180)|
| 3:56:24| The state has abrogated their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14184)|
| 3:56:29| to handle mental health, and it's fallen on cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14189)|
| 3:56:33| And we are stuck with trying to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14193)|
| 3:56:38| And there's so much more we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14198)|
| 3:56:40| The trend of taking the load off of police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| in instances like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14204)|
| 3:56:45| is something we definitely need to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14205)|
| 3:56:49| So just to reiterate, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14209)|
| 3:56:52| I don't want it to be perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14212)|
| 3:56:55| that us passing this measure right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| which we can implement quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14217)|
| 3:57:00| and will get us some feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14220)|
| 3:57:03| is us not going forward with other programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14223)|
| 3:57:09| that we can supplement this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| One thing I do know, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14231)|
| 3:57:12| is we need at least one team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14232)|
| 3:57:15| where an officer accompanies a mental health worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14235)|
| 3:57:20| Because as Chief Thomas has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14240)|
| 3:57:23| and in our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14243)|
| 3:57:27| officers and mental health workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14247)|
| 3:57:29| oftentimes aren't gonna know what they're facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14249)|
| 3:57:33| until they get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14253)|
| 3:57:35| Person calls in on a 911 call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| they gives us information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| and officers go out or mental health workers go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14259)|
| 3:57:43| and they find out it's not at all what they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14263)|
| 3:57:47| And so we need to have at least one team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14267)|
| 3:57:51| where a mental health worker has protection to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14271)|
| 3:57:55| at least until they assess the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14275)|
| 3:57:59| Now, there may be other instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| many other instances where we don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14280)|
| 3:58:03| We can just send out mental health workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14283)|
| 3:58:06| But I see passing this resolution tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14286)|
| 3:58:09| as being a necessary team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14289)|
| 3:58:13| that we should supplement consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14293)|
| 3:58:16| on what some of the other speakers were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14296)|
| 3:58:21| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14301)|
| 3:58:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14302)|
| 3:58:24| I echo what Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| and Council Member Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14305)|
| 3:58:27| This is a positive step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| and I think we'll do more of this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| I think it's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| One specific question I had for Chief Thomas was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14314)|
| 3:58:39| will the body cameras be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14319)|
| 3:58:42| on the participating officer in this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14322)|
| 3:58:47| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| We haven't actually talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| We talked about every uniformed officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14331)|
| 3:58:54| wearing a body camera when this is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| Now, and Vice Mayor McKenzie brought up a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| and that's one thing that Captain Jones has texted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14341)|
| 3:59:03| that it has been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| is the officer being in plainclothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14345)|
| 3:59:07| And we had already talked about an unmarked car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14347)|
| 3:59:10| So if that officer was in plainclothes, then no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14350)|
| 3:59:13| They most likely would not have a body camera on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14353)|
| 3:59:17| We could make an exception for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14357)|
| 3:59:19| but I would think the typical policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14359)|
| 3:59:20| and we would worry about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14360)|
| 3:59:22| that kind of footage being released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14362)|
| 3:59:23| if there was some kind of a medical condition going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14363)|
| 3:59:27| Probably preclude us from having to redact that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14367)|
| 3:59:31| I don't know the right answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| It's just a question that I think is important to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14373)|
| 3:59:36| So if you need to consider it more, fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14376)|
| 3:59:40| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| Please do consider that dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14385)|
| 3:59:47| Ms. Testerman, and then Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14387)|
| 3:59:50| So wanting to, and we talked about it in our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14390)|
| 3:59:53| which I really do think was great last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14393)|
| 3:59:57| but as far as the crisis intervention team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| and also continuing education with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14400)|
| 4:00:04| that really it's just a launch pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14404)|
| 4:00:07| for what we wanna try and accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14407)|
| 4:00:10| To Chief Thomas, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14410)|
| 4:00:13| or if you could shed a little bit more light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| that there's been sort of an informal implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14416)|
| 4:00:21| of what we're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14421)|
| 4:00:24| over the last year, year and a half, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| And that my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14427)|
| 4:00:31| is that there's been some kind of tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| and that calls have actually decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| for calls of service as a result of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| you know, again, some informal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14441)|
| 4:00:46| you know, collaboration where this is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14446)|
| 4:00:52| So I didn't know if you can speak to that or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14452)|
| 4:00:56| and two, that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14456)|
| 4:00:57| I think we're one of the only cities of our size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14457)|
| 4:01:00| that don't have really anything in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| or anything formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14462)|
| 4:01:05| So I think our CIT trained officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14465)|
| 4:01:10| that go out and respond to these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| and we try and track those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| and those individuals to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| that they do get follow-up care with a professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14476)|
| 4:01:20| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14480)|
| 4:01:21| I know that one of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| who is a CIT certified officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14483)|
| 4:01:25| actually received the officer of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14485)|
| 4:01:28| I can't remember which month last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14488)|
| 4:01:30| but her commitment was so strong to this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14490)|
| 4:01:33| that she went out on her own time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| because there could not be a caseworker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| assigned to this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14497)|
| 4:01:38| and took them on her own time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14498)|
| 4:01:42| to make sure that they got to an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| So, you know, we have officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14504)|
| 4:01:46| that are so committed to mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14506)|
| 4:01:48| and mental health care for folks in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| And yes, we are trying to track that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| and we are trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14513)|
| 4:01:54| get the people that we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14514)|
| 4:01:56| the resources that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14516)|
| 4:01:57| So we're not going and repeating the same call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14519)|
| 4:02:00| But I think that's where this co-responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14520)|
| 4:02:02| will really help us to formally track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14522)|
| 4:02:05| And it may not be what our community needs or wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14525)|
| 4:02:08| but we can maybe hopefully tailor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14528)|
| 4:02:11| And if it does just turn into a mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| only responder or a CAHOOTS model, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14533)|
| 4:02:18| This is just a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14538)|
| 4:02:20| We want to try, we need to try something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14540)|
| 4:02:22| We need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14542)|
| 4:02:23| As all the callers have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14543)|
| 4:02:26| we are not mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14546)|
| 4:02:28| At best, we can barely triage on a 40 hour certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14548)|
| 4:02:33| I agree with every caller who said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| but we do want to help and we want to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14555)|
| 4:02:39| And we want, you know, we're trying our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14559)|
| 4:02:42| So, you know, we want to get this model started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14562)|
| 4:02:46| We want to see track, do the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| and see where it leads from there and continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14568)|
| 4:02:51| And continue to try and address those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| I know homelessness came up and I know when I was assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14575)|
| 4:02:58| just in the downtown area as a Lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14578)|
| 4:03:02| my rough estimate, probably 85 to 90%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14582)|
| 4:03:04| of our homeless folks down there had mental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| So we know this is prevalent in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| and something that we need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14589)|
| 4:03:13| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14593)|
| 4:03:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14594)|
| 4:03:15| Yeah, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14595)|
| 4:03:16| I mean, I'm certainly supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14596)|
| 4:03:19| and feel like it's a good inroads too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| to develop empathy and trust among the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14601)|
| 4:03:26| and the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14606)|
| 4:03:28| Thank you, Ms. Testament, Ms. Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14608)|
| 4:03:31| and then Ms. Parker, I think I had her hand up after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14613)|
| 4:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14614)|
| 4:03:36| Chief Thomas, when we were doing the budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14616)|
| 4:03:40| sometime during COVID, which was in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14620)|
| 4:03:43| we were talking about how many empty positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| there were for officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14628)|
| 4:03:49| Do you remember, or what is it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14629)|
| 4:03:54| The spaces that haven't been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14634)|
| 4:03:57| Right now, I have 359 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14637)|
| 4:04:01| I'm authorized to 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14641)|
| 4:04:04| So I am very much below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14644)|
| 4:04:06| I have 21 in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14646)|
| 4:04:08| I have hopefully 27 that will be starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14648)|
| 4:04:11| an academy in September, September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14651)|
| 4:04:14| So we're working on getting those numbers up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14654)|
| 4:04:16| because what we have had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14656)|
| 4:04:17| is we've had to have officers work double shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| just to fill our beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| We're still barely managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| and trying to get all of our calls answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14664)|
| 4:04:26| and responding in a proactive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14666)|
| 4:04:28| We're not able to do those proactive type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14668)|
| 4:04:32| So we're kind of trying to do some workarounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14672)|
| 4:04:35| to try and make sure that we're addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| and being proactive in our community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14680)|
| 4:04:42| How is this program being paid for, this pilot program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14682)|
| 4:04:47| I'll have to put that over to Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14687)|
| 4:04:51| We scraped around the money and came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14691)|
| 4:04:55| That'll be in the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| budget ordinance amendment that's in item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14698)|
| 4:05:01| But essentially, we're transferring 74,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14701)|
| 4:05:07| from the housing and neighborhood development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14707)|
| 4:05:12| general fund budget to Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14712)|
| 4:05:17| in order to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14717)|
| 4:05:21| And then the remainder of that is what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14721)|
| 4:05:24| about 20,000 will be coming out of the just KP budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14724)|
| 4:05:29| Out of the $60 million budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14729)|
| 4:05:32| Affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14732)|
| 4:05:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14734)|
| 4:05:35| Why was this idea chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| when we have a need for the community funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14737)|
| 4:05:44| Why is it not coming from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| if this is policing or public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14747)|
| 4:05:52| I'm not asking you, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14752)|
| 4:05:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14753)|
| 4:05:54| Just, I guess whoever made these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14754)|
| 4:05:59| This was something that was put in place a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14759)|
| 4:06:02| Chief Thomas, about this money put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14762)|
| 4:06:05| to deal with street prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14765)|
| 4:06:08| Chief Thomas, could you explain the background behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| And what, you know, just, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14771)|
| 4:06:15| Yes, we had a co-responder model based upon, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14775)|
| 4:06:19| prostitution, which we had a very serious issue with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14779)|
| 4:06:22| and a lot of it's gone online now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| but it was so that we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14784)|
| 4:06:27| these mental health services and supportive services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| available to folks, these women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14789)|
| 4:06:32| rather than arresting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14792)|
| 4:06:33| and putting them in a criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| trying to get them some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| And as those folks disappeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| we realized that we wanted to use these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14799)|
| 4:06:43| to deal with our homeless issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14803)|
| 4:06:46| co-responder with our homeless issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14806)|
| 4:06:48| And that dovetailed right into the mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14808)|
| 4:06:52| And so the mental health aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14812)|
| 4:06:55| has come to be a bigger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14815)|
| 4:06:59| among the homeless population as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| So we're hitting as many folks as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14821)|
| 4:07:04| not just our homeless people with mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14824)|
| 4:07:06| but all of our other mental health calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| hopefully with this co-responder team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14828)|
| 4:07:11| Okay, so if in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14831)|
| 4:07:12| we chose to go with a different model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14832)|
| 4:07:15| that did not include policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14835)|
| 4:07:19| to be that intimately involved in every single call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14839)|
| 4:07:24| would it be funded from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14844)|
| 4:07:28| or from community development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14848)|
| 4:07:31| Council Member Singh, I'm gonna ask Stephanie Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14851)|
| 4:07:34| to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14854)|
| 4:07:35| because this was a situation that had some history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14855)|
| 4:07:39| as Chief Thomas described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| and Stephanie's in a good position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14861)|
| 4:07:44| to explain why we are doing it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14864)|
| 4:07:46| for this particular pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| Great, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14868)|
| 4:07:49| And thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14869)|
| 4:07:52| I think Chief Thomas did a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14872)|
| 4:07:55| of kind of summing it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14875)|
| 4:07:56| but just to kind of hit the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14876)|
| 4:07:59| This funding is funding that was actually new local dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14879)|
| 4:08:05| that were appropriated to community development in 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14885)|
| 4:08:11| as part of the safe space package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| So I was actually on council at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14894)|
| 4:08:18| and I'm sure many of us remember the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14898)|
| 4:08:20| around that safe space funding package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14900)|
| 4:08:24| And this portion of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14904)|
| 4:08:29| was for a contract between KPD and Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14909)|
| 4:08:35| for the street prostitution program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14915)|
| 4:08:37| So community development was administering the dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14917)|
| 4:08:42| but the contract was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14922)|
| 4:08:44| between KPD and Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14924)|
| 4:08:48| So really this is sort of cleaning it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14928)|
| 4:08:52| and getting community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14932)|
| 4:08:55| out of the middle of that arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| And so as Chief Thomas indicated in fiscal years 18 and 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14937)|
| 4:09:03| the funds were used for the street prostitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14943)|
| 4:09:06| diversion program, and I think that program has evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14946)|
| 4:09:13| to the contract wasn't needed anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14953)|
| 4:09:17| And in realizing that this partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14957)|
| 4:09:20| was coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14960)|
| 4:09:23| we knew that this was going to be the arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| that the contract would be with KPD and not with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14965)|
| 4:09:31| it wouldn't be putting community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14971)|
| 4:09:35| or housing and neighborhood development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| in the middle of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| So hopefully that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14979)|
| 4:09:40| It's not taking funding away from something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14980)|
| 4:09:44| that housing and neighborhood development was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| This was already geared toward this partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14986)|
| 4:09:49| with between KPD and Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14989)|
| 4:09:53| Okay, so I'm not gonna get into the prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14993)|
| 4:09:56| I know that sex trafficking has not decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=14996)|
| 4:10:00| So I'm not sure why we're not using the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15000)|
| 4:10:02| But this pilot program, I'm not a fan of it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15002)|
| 4:10:10| At first I was feeling like, well, what harm can come of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15010)|
| 4:10:13| I don't see that it could go well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15013)|
| 4:10:16| but I think the harm that can come of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15016)|
| 4:10:19| is setting up a model that if it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15019)|
| 4:10:23| we say, see the social work model doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| Whereas it's very, very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| than including something into the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15029)|
| 4:10:32| versus finding a different solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| And the place that we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15035)|
| 4:10:37| with how dire this situation has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15037)|
| 4:10:41| we can't take little baby steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15041)|
| 4:10:42| And to me, that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| I think we would do much better using the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15045)|
| 4:10:49| to figure out how to do a larger program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| I know that from Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15052)|
| 4:10:54| Leah and Hilliard would make a great researcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15054)|
| 4:10:58| She's been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15058)|
| 4:11:00| So the contract would remain with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15060)|
| 4:11:02| and Department of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15062)|
| 4:11:05| But I think we need to do something bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| where we're past little tweaks and changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15067)|
| 4:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15071)|
| 4:11:15| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15075)|
| 4:11:19| I'm also of the opinion that this is not a step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15079)|
| 4:11:22| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15082)|
| 4:11:27| I've been a fan of the CAHOOTS program for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15087)|
| 4:11:31| And I looked into it during the budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| because I was hoping we could move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15093)|
| 4:11:36| some of the unfilled KPD positions over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15096)|
| 4:11:40| and change those to social worker positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15100)|
| 4:11:43| And as y'all know, during that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| I explained that that requires a class comp change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15105)|
| 4:11:50| of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| And so it wasn't something we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15111)|
| 4:11:52| during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15112)|
| 4:11:56| But as I looked into CAHOOTS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| this Denver STAR program, CAHOOTS is 800,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15118)|
| 4:12:03| The Denver STAR program is 200,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15123)|
| 4:12:07| If we're talking about making an investment like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15127)|
| 4:12:13| I would rather make, as Councilwoman Fee stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15133)|
| 4:12:18| make that significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15138)|
| 4:12:19| so that we can do this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15139)|
| 4:12:23| As I stated on the body cam during the body cam discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15143)|
| 4:12:28| it amazes me what we're willing to increase by 400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15148)|
| 4:12:35| without much discussion and what issues we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15155)|
| 4:12:38| And this is an issue we can increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15158)|
| 4:12:41| We can double the amount that we're investing as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15161)|
| 4:12:45| increase it to 200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| and begin to build that model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15167)|
| 4:12:50| that the community is calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15170)|
| 4:12:53| The conversations I've heard around this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15173)|
| 4:12:56| even before the direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15176)|
| 4:13:00| the conversation has gone over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15180)|
| 4:13:03| before the community was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15183)|
| 4:13:06| we're relying on police for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15186)|
| 4:13:10| And yes, we want police to be better trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15190)|
| 4:13:13| Yes, we want better accountability measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| but we also want alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| so that we are not relying on police for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15197)|
| 4:13:21| And I'm concerned for us to even move in this direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| as if adding on once again to KPD's already full plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15205)|
| 4:13:33| is really addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15213)|
| 4:13:36| I don't think it's addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15216)|
| 4:13:38| I think it'll make us feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| Like we did something, we took that good step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15220)|
| 4:13:45| but really it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| And just like with the discussions before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15227)|
| 4:13:56| there was a discussion of whether we can discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15236)|
| 4:14:00| a charter amendment after only a month of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15240)|
| 4:14:05| Well, that charter amendment goes to the public to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| and it costs us nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15248)|
| 4:14:10| This is a program and may have been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15250)|
| 4:14:13| in the back halls of the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15253)|
| 4:14:16| but it has not been discussed thoroughly publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| And I do not believe that this is what the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15260)|
| 4:14:23| is calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15263)|
| 4:14:24| And I think that we have the capacity, we have the means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15264)|
| 4:14:30| and I wish we would have the will to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15270)|
| 4:14:34| We can leave that money in community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15274)|
| 4:14:38| add to it and begin to build a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15278)|
| 4:14:41| that's gonna take work off of KPD's plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15281)|
| 4:14:45| and give our community members experiencing a mental crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15285)|
| 4:14:50| the services they need and deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15290)|
| 4:14:55| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15295)|
| 4:14:58| Any other questions or comments, Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15298)|
| 4:15:03| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15303)|
| 4:15:06| I certainly am very interested in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15306)|
| 4:15:10| and it may very well be something that we should pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15310)|
| 4:15:17| I do think that we've had one of our council workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15317)|
| 4:15:23| on potential reforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| We've got two more scheduled in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15325)|
| 4:15:28| So what I might ask is for some of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15328)|
| 4:15:33| that are feeling a little bit less comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| with the approach that's going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| would this be better for us to pick back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15338)|
| 4:15:42| after we've had a chance to have the workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15342)|
| 4:15:45| and can explore this option and maybe other options as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15345)|
| 4:15:50| in those workshops, which I agree with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15350)|
| 4:15:55| that said, hey, that was a very good meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15359)|
| 4:16:02| This may very well be a program that we should all support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15362)|
| 4:16:06| but should we wait and do it after we've had our workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15366)|
| 4:16:10| and had a chance to discuss it further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15370)|
| 4:16:13| So I just put that out there to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15373)|
| 4:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15377)|
| 4:16:22| I would just say, Mr. Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15382)|
| 4:16:27| I think we're having a lot of good discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| both during council workshops and other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15389)|
| 4:16:33| I've had with Knoxville Renaissance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| and other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| And I welcome the continued community conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15397)|
| 4:16:40| And I believe that conversations are gonna continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15400)|
| 4:16:44| in the format of the Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15404)|
| 4:16:48| All these conversations should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15408)|
| 4:16:51| We are part of, we're engaging in a community conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15411)|
| 4:16:55| about re-imagining public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| and collecting that information and responding to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15417)|
| 4:17:02| and examining whether a CAHOOTS model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15422)|
| 4:17:04| would work for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15424)|
| 4:17:05| whether we need to bolster the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15425)|
| 4:17:10| we already have, like the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15430)|
| 4:17:12| the Mobile Crisis Unit, CIT training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15432)|
| 4:17:17| how we do response requests for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15437)|
| 4:17:22| how they're dispatched and tracked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15442)|
| 4:17:24| and who responds to what calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15444)|
| 4:17:27| All of these are really good questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15447)|
| 4:17:28| and things that I thought that was a great first workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15448)|
| 4:17:33| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15453)|
| 4:17:34| I would just say, it doesn't hurt to go ahead and try this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15454)|
| 4:17:39| because the community has been asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15459)|
| 4:17:43| the community is not like we want a co-response model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15463)|
| 4:17:46| That's sort of a arcane term that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| most people aren't that clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15470)|
| 4:17:51| but they have been saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| can we, like other council members have been saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15473)|
| 4:17:56| can we relieve this burden of KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15476)|
| 4:17:58| because they're not mental health professionals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15478)|
| 4:18:01| And this is a way of trying one approach to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15481)|
| 4:18:03| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15483)|
| 4:18:04| It's just a small pilot with one social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15484)|
| 4:18:10| accompanying one police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15490)|
| 4:18:12| maybe in an unmarked car without uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15492)|
| 4:18:14| This is what Chief Thomas has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15494)|
| 4:18:16| I think that it doesn't hurt us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15496)|
| 4:18:19| to continue to try that pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15499)|
| 4:18:22| and that pilot can then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15502)|
| 4:18:23| we can come back and report to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| say, how's it going in three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15505)|
| 4:18:29| and then say, well, let's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| this has made it clear that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| this would be more helpful to do at a bigger scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15513)|
| 4:18:36| or in a conjunction with a model that's not co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15516)|
| 4:18:40| but whatever the word is for not co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15520)|
| 4:18:43| independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| So I would encourage you guys to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15525)|
| 4:18:49| and move forward and ask for a report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15529)|
| 4:18:53| as you continue to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15533)|
| 4:18:54| as we all continue to have the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| Yeah, I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15538)|
| 4:19:02| well, we've got several things I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15542)|
| 4:19:04| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15544)|
| 4:19:05| the comments that Council Person Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| and Council Person Parker made just really hit home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15547)|
| 4:19:13| My sentiments are so much with what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15553)|
| 4:19:16| We are not doing enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15556)|
| 4:19:18| and we need to have a much larger program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15558)|
| 4:19:22| This discussion needs to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15562)|
| 4:19:25| but I don't see that implementing this program right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15565)|
| 4:19:30| is at all going to impede us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15570)|
| 4:19:33| from discussing these broader issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15573)|
| 4:19:36| in the workshops that we have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15576)|
| 4:19:40| I know that I certainly want to expand the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15580)|
| 4:19:45| and consider all these other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15585)|
| 4:19:48| but there seems to be, again, some kind of idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15588)|
| 4:19:51| If we pass this right now, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15591)|
| 4:19:55| We can pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| and then still have these deep, vibrant discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15597)|
| 4:20:01| in the workshops to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| So I don't see this at all as throwing cold water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15603)|
| 4:20:08| on the passionate discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15608)|
| 4:20:11| that we can have in workshops that are already scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15611)|
| 4:20:14| And we will have this in action already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15614)|
| 4:20:17| and it will be a part of what the piece of the puzzle is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15617)|
| 4:20:21| if nothing else, just getting more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15621)|
| 4:20:25| And it also may help some individuals immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15625)|
| 4:20:29| that are out there on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15629)|
| 4:20:31| So it may be immediate aid to some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15631)|
| 4:20:35| that in the real world might be getting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15635)|
| 4:20:38| in the next two months or the next three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15638)|
| 4:20:41| that they wouldn't be getting if we wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15641)|
| 4:20:44| to consider this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15644)|
| 4:20:46| So I don't want to be redundant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15646)|
| 4:20:49| but passing this tonight is not chilling at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15649)|
| 4:20:55| My passion for doing something much bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15655)|
| 4:20:58| and continuing this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15658)|
| 4:21:00| because this is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15660)|
| 4:21:02| It's not even close to enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15662)|
| 4:21:06| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15666)|
| 4:21:08| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15668)|
| 4:21:10| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15670)|
| 4:21:12| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15672)|
| 4:21:13| If we were to move forward with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15673)|
| 4:21:16| we would then be entering into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15676)|
| 4:21:19| with Helen Ross McNabb, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15679)|
| 4:21:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15683)|
| 4:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15684)|
| 4:21:24| So with that said, and I do appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15684)|
| 4:21:29| all the conversation and the very good points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15689)|
| 4:21:32| that my colleagues have made as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15692)|
| 4:21:35| to there's so much more that we potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15695)|
| 4:21:39| well, we know that there's a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15699)|
| 4:21:40| that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15700)|
| 4:21:41| Is that that opportunity, once we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15701)|
| 4:21:44| with our due diligence in assessing the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15704)|
| 4:21:47| because once we go into this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15707)|
| 4:21:50| it sounds like it would be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15710)|
| 4:21:51| to try to re-divert that funding from this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15711)|
| 4:22:00| I'm not sure, I'm just putting that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15720)|
| 4:22:02| but it appears that if we go into a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15722)|
| 4:22:04| that we would be in that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15724)|
| 4:22:08| I'm sure that they would work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15728)|
| 4:22:09| if we might go in different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15729)|
| 4:22:11| but I do like the thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15731)|
| 4:22:16| that Council Member Roberto brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15736)|
| 4:22:20| Again, I think it is about doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15740)|
| 4:22:21| some additional due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| If there's an opportunity that we may can explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15743)|
| 4:22:26| I think this, again, it is a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15746)|
| 4:22:29| It's a framework, but I think we need to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15749)|
| 4:22:32| a little bit more from KPD to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15752)|
| 4:22:34| is there an opportunity to expand this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15754)|
| 4:22:39| as we look at it or a different type model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15759)|
| 4:22:43| that may afford us with some additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15763)|
| 4:22:47| to do more and to touch more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| So that's kind of, I wanted to just put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15769)|
| 4:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15772)|
| 4:22:54| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15774)|
| 4:22:55| I just want to say this is a one-year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15775)|
| 4:22:58| with an option to renew it after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15778)|
| 4:23:00| for up to two additional years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15780)|
| 4:23:03| And these conversations that we're having as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15783)|
| 4:23:06| and as in the community, I think will be very timely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15786)|
| 4:23:10| as we develop the budget for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15790)|
| 4:23:14| Who was next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15794)|
| 4:23:15| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15795)|
| 4:23:17| Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15797)|
| 4:23:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15799)|
| 4:23:21| Council Member Thomas, what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15801)|
| 4:23:24| about trying to help people right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15804)|
| 4:23:27| that was a very strong feeling that I have also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15807)|
| 4:23:30| But then if you look through the phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15810)|
| 4:23:32| it's gonna take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15812)|
| 4:23:34| I mean, the two people that get chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15814)|
| 4:23:36| to do this type of teamwork have to be pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15816)|
| 4:23:40| They have to have a lot of different roles, training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15820)|
| 4:23:43| So it's gonna take a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15823)|
| 4:23:47| I don't remember the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15827)|
| 4:23:48| maybe even six months to get them trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15828)|
| 4:23:52| and get this implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15832)|
| 4:23:54| In that time, we're wasting time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| because then we look and see how it works for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15837)|
| 4:24:01| And then we start looking at different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| And then we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| It's just, it takes, these are these tiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| tiny little steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15847)|
| 4:24:08| And each one of these is delaying some real work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15848)|
| 4:24:12| The police are tired of being social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15852)|
| 4:24:14| The community is tired of over policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15854)|
| 4:24:18| And I wanna get started on something substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15862)|
| 4:24:24| Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15864)|
| 4:24:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15868)|
| 4:24:30| Couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15870)|
| 4:24:31| First of all, I agree with Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15871)|
| 4:24:33| that I want us to do something right now to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15873)|
| 4:24:39| We may not like it, but when people call 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15879)|
| 4:24:43| they expect law enforcement or somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15883)|
| 4:24:46| to come deal with their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15886)|
| 4:24:48| We know this is a continual, this is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15888)|
| 4:24:52| And I believe putting a social worker with an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15892)|
| 4:25:00| is not a bad idea to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15900)|
| 4:25:04| I worry sometimes that we will wind up letting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15904)|
| 4:25:11| getting it perfect be the enemy of getting it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15911)|
| 4:25:16| And so I would suggest that this gives us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15916)|
| 4:25:20| to start making something better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15920)|
| 4:25:22| not to the exclusion of looking for the final solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| That was just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15926)|
| 4:25:27| My question about the contract, though, is when it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15927)|
| 4:25:33| It's for one year with the renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| Can someone tell me what triggers the renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15935)|
| 4:25:40| I know it doesn't have to come back before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15940)|
| 4:25:43| So if contracts are written with options to renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15943)|
| 4:25:48| so what kind of report should we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15948)|
| 4:25:53| Or can we amend this motion that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15953)|
| 4:25:57| we have to have a report before it can be renewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15960)|
| 4:26:02| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15962)|
| 4:26:03| Council Member Fugate, there are points in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15963)|
| 4:26:06| where there's built-in evaluation and revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15966)|
| 4:26:09| The contract can be terminated at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15969)|
| 4:26:11| with or without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15971)|
| 4:26:14| So if we decide after that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15974)|
| 4:26:16| that we would rather do something bigger in lieu of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15976)|
| 4:26:22| rather than in addition to it, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15982)|
| 4:26:26| Again, I think that we, you know, my proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15986)|
| 4:26:30| that this is not in lieu of something bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15990)|
| 4:26:33| It's to start, it's to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15993)|
| 4:26:34| and have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15994)|
| 4:26:36| And I think your analogy of don't let the perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15996)|
| 4:26:39| be the enemy of the good is a good analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=15999)|
| 4:26:42| This is not the final answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16002)|
| 4:26:44| to all our problems with public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16004)|
| 4:26:47| And will it be a perfect pilot where we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16007)|
| 4:26:52| you know, it won't, you know, but it's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16012)|
| 4:26:54| It's a step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16014)|
| 4:26:56| It's not a huge step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16016)|
| 4:26:59| I agree, but within the existing context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16019)|
| 4:27:05| this is something we can do within our current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| within our current budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16027)|
| 4:27:09| and then use that to help us make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16029)|
| 4:27:11| to make bigger plans in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16031)|
| 4:27:17| You know, we've worked with Helen Ross McNabb for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16037)|
| 4:27:21| They're excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16041)|
| 4:27:22| I'm excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| I think that, again, I'm not saying this is the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16044)|
| 4:27:28| but just sort of like when we looked at our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16048)|
| 4:27:30| some of our policies on use of force, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16050)|
| 4:27:34| changing it, adding, making sure we were in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16054)|
| 4:27:37| with the eight can't wait, that was a start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| not a finish to looking at our police policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16059)|
| 4:27:42| And that's why you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16062)|
| 4:27:43| one of the things you're conducting those workshops for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16063)|
| 4:27:45| So, you know, I hope that answers some of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16065)|
| 4:27:50| about the particularities of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16070)|
| 4:27:53| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16073)|
| 4:27:53| I appreciate the fact that it can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| it can be canceled by us without a cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16075)|
| 4:28:02| So we can get out of it whenever we want out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16082)|
| 4:28:04| So some of the questions about if we spend this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16084)|
| 4:28:07| it's lost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16087)|
| 4:28:09| If we decide in six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16089)|
| 4:28:11| we want to do something else, we can cancel the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16091)|
| 4:28:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16094)|
| 4:28:15| Counseling member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16095)|
| 4:28:18| Oh yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16098)|
| 4:28:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16099)|
| 4:28:21| I think what, I think this has been touched before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16101)|
| 4:28:26| but I think it's really important that we point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16106)|
| 4:28:27| the reason we're having this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16107)|
| 4:28:30| or one of the reasons is that our healthcare system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16110)|
| 4:28:33| is not addressing mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| And that's been a steady, long, long decline for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16115)|
| 4:28:40| And we've seen our homeless population increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16120)|
| 4:28:43| and we've seen our options like Lake Shore decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16123)|
| 4:28:48| and the funding for other options isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16128)|
| 4:28:52| And so that's why we're having this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16132)|
| 4:28:55| because we have, we've asked our police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16135)|
| 4:28:57| to be our mental health care providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16137)|
| 4:29:00| And that's not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16140)|
| 4:29:04| I want to make a couple of points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16144)|
| 4:29:08| I've realized and I've looked and done research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| and I've talked to folks who've communicated with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16150)|
| 4:29:13| about this on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16153)|
| 4:29:17| It's interesting to note that other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16157)|
| 4:29:19| have been doing co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| Other cities have been doing the Kahoot style model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16161)|
| 4:29:25| But what's interesting is that Denver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| added the Kahoot style model and kept their co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16167)|
| 4:29:31| Seven cities in the state of Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16171)|
| 4:29:34| state funded did the co-response model and they added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16174)|
| 4:29:39| They're not, they're doing both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16179)|
| 4:29:41| And that's what I ask is that we need to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16181)|
| 4:29:44| And what I don't believe that doing this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16184)|
| 4:29:50| and starting with something precludes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16190)|
| 4:29:54| from planning for the other simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16194)|
| 4:29:56| at the same time and in addition to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16196)|
| 4:29:58| because that's what other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16198)|
| 4:30:01| To be able to do the co, to be able to improve on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16201)|
| 4:30:05| and to be able to do a more Kahoot style model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16205)|
| 4:30:10| we really have to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16210)|
| 4:30:12| about our 911 call routing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16212)|
| 4:30:16| And I believe I've had a little conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16216)|
| 4:30:18| with Aaron Gill about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16218)|
| 4:30:20| but I believe American Canon is on the board for 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16220)|
| 4:30:27| And I just, I want to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16227)|
| 4:30:31| because this puts a social worker out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16231)|
| 4:30:34| dealing with situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16234)|
| 4:30:35| We've had several past incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16235)|
| 4:30:37| where we've had people in a mental health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16237)|
| 4:30:42| with weapons and we've only sent police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16242)|
| 4:30:46| We have a position, we have money right now in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16246)|
| 4:30:49| that's no longer funding that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16249)|
| 4:30:51| that was going previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16251)|
| 4:30:53| And we can send a social worker out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| a police officer in an unmarked car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16255)|
| 4:30:57| not in a uniform and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16257)|
| 4:31:00| At the same time, we're studying and addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16260)|
| 4:31:02| how to start a Kahoot style model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16262)|
| 4:31:06| They're not an exclusion of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16266)|
| 4:31:08| And so what I'm demanding of the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16268)|
| 4:31:12| and the police and Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16272)|
| 4:31:14| and our state legislators and our federal legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16274)|
| 4:31:17| because guys, this is bigger than our pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16277)|
| 4:31:20| This is bigger than our pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16280)|
| 4:31:22| That's why we're in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16282)|
| 4:31:25| I get tired of everybody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16285)|
| 4:31:26| how's the city gonna pay for everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16286)|
| 4:31:28| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16288)|
| 4:31:29| The federal government pulled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16289)|
| 4:31:31| and stopped paying for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16291)|
| 4:31:33| People are getting kicked off of TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Lakeshore is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| We are now paying locally through our county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16297)|
| 4:31:39| to take people to Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| And that's coming out of our tax pockets here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16301)|
| 4:31:45| So instead of just telling us to solve the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16305)|
| 4:31:48| we need to be making more noise to other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16308)|
| 4:31:50| to solve the problem as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| I've been in conversations with state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16313)|
| 4:31:56| where someone's standing there going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16316)|
| 4:31:58| Lauren, what are you guys at the city doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16318)|
| 4:31:59| to solve all the homeless problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| Oh yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16321)|
| 4:32:02| It's our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16322)|
| 4:32:03| We, this little group of folks and the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16323)|
| 4:32:06| are the ones that are supposed to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16326)|
| 4:32:07| every flipping problem that everybody else isn't funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16327)|
| 4:32:11| So let's have a real conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16331)|
| 4:32:12| and talk about how we do it outside of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16332)|
| 4:32:16| because it's not just our budget that's gonna solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16336)|
| 4:32:19| So sorry, I'm impassioned about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16339)|
| 4:32:21| and I'm angry about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16341)|
| 4:32:22| that it's constantly us to solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16342)|
| 4:32:25| So I'll get back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16345)|
| 4:32:28| I would like to ask someone from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16348)|
| 4:32:31| and or Chief Thomas, how this will be staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16351)|
| 4:32:35| how you'll select the social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16355)|
| 4:32:38| what training they're gonna have, what backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16358)|
| 4:32:43| And also I would say that we insist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16363)|
| 4:32:45| on having a check-in workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| I don't know, by December-ish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16367)|
| 4:32:50| before we start the budget process for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16370)|
| 4:32:56| That sounds fine as far as the check-in process with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16376)|
| 4:32:59| Chief Thomas and someone from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16379)|
| 4:33:03| could speak to that, to Ms. Ryder's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16383)|
| 4:33:07| Sure, and it's gonna take a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16387)|
| 4:33:11| We're gonna identify the CIT officers that will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16391)|
| 4:33:15| We'll have certain officers, more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16395)|
| 4:33:20| It'll be a master's level behavioral health staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16400)|
| 4:33:24| that will be a mental health professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16404)|
| 4:33:27| They're gonna have to have an orientation to a KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16407)|
| 4:33:30| and how we do answer calls and how we handle things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16410)|
| 4:33:33| And we're gonna have to learn from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16413)|
| 4:33:36| I think just because we have a CIT trained person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16416)|
| 4:33:40| doesn't mean that we are a professional at handling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16420)|
| 4:33:44| That's what we're gonna learn to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16424)|
| 4:33:46| We're getting better at it, but please help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16426)|
| 4:33:48| This is gonna help us across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16428)|
| 4:33:51| I mean, if you help somebody tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16431)|
| 4:33:53| if we get this contract signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16433)|
| 4:33:54| and we get somebody out there to help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16434)|
| 4:33:56| we're helping one or two people, that's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16436)|
| 4:34:00| We have the broader discussions about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16440)|
| 4:34:04| they're not, again, it's not mutually exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16444)|
| 4:34:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16447)|
| 4:34:08| And if you wanna report, we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16448)|
| 4:34:11| We can report every council meeting or once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16451)|
| 4:34:14| Here's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16454)|
| 4:34:15| Here's who we've helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16455)|
| 4:34:16| Here's how we've tracked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16456)|
| 4:34:19| I'm up for any and all suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16459)|
| 4:34:21| We just wanna help this part of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| that needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16464)|
| 4:34:25| I don't know if we have the issue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16465)|
| 4:34:29| But we're trying to figure out how can we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16469)|
| 4:34:31| How can we do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16471)|
| 4:34:32| How can we do it faster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16472)|
| 4:34:35| And I'll defer to, I don't know who else is on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16475)|
| 4:34:40| Houston Smeltzer from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16480)|
| 4:34:43| or someone from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16483)|
| 4:34:47| Hello, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16487)|
| 4:34:48| This is Houston Smeltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16488)|
| 4:34:49| I think Leigh Ann, if Will could unmute Leigh Ann| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16489)|
| 4:34:52| and we'll check and get into the pattern pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16492)|
| 4:34:54| and who we're looking for to fill this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16494)|
| 4:35:04| This is Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16504)|
| 4:35:05| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16505)|
| 4:35:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16506)|
| 4:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16507)|
| 4:35:08| Before I, I would just like to take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16508)|
| 4:35:10| to say the conversations that you all are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16510)|
| 4:35:15| about doing something different for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16515)|
| 4:35:18| in our community that are struggling with mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16518)|
| 4:35:21| and the other callers that are so passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16521)|
| 4:35:24| about trying to meet this need is very inspiring to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16524)|
| 4:35:28| So I appreciate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16528)|
| 4:35:30| As far as to answer the question about the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16530)|
| 4:35:34| I think that the most important thing for us to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16534)|
| 4:35:39| is somebody who can quickly develop rapport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16539)|
| 4:35:42| and relationships with a difficult to engage population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16542)|
| 4:35:47| Because I think for our experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16547)|
| 4:35:50| is that you can take the most educated or the most trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16550)|
| 4:35:56| but if you don't have the ability for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16556)|
| 4:35:59| to quickly build a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16559)|
| 4:36:01| because we will only have a brief moment at sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16561)|
| 4:36:04| in some situations to be able to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16564)|
| 4:36:07| and create a lasting intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16567)|
| 4:36:10| So that'll be what we're looking for when we interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| for individuals for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16572)|
| 4:36:15| We also wanna make sure that the person is knowledgeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16575)|
| 4:36:19| about community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16579)|
| 4:36:20| We want the person to have that master's level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16580)|
| 4:36:23| so that if the individual needs to get to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16583)|
| 4:36:26| we can expedite that without him or her having to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16586)|
| 4:36:30| through additional steps to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16590)|
| 4:36:33| But we also want to find an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| that can really excel in that case management type role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16595)|
| 4:36:41| And also understand how to work with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16601)|
| 4:36:44| because as you all know, this is a difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16604)|
| 4:36:48| for families if you're calling or something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16608)|
| 4:36:51| is going on in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16611)|
| 4:36:52| And we wanna make sure that we're not only caring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16612)|
| 4:36:55| for the individual in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16615)|
| 4:36:56| but we're caring for the entire family or friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16616)|
| 4:36:59| or whoever they identify as their family around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16619)|
| 4:37:03| So that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| I don't know if that answers your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16625)|
| 4:37:06| Of course, they will all have all their certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16626)|
| 4:37:08| and make sure that they're trained internally with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16628)|
| 4:37:10| as far as our TUIC orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16630)|
| 4:37:13| if they're not already an existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16633)|
| 4:37:15| And of course, we would also have them meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16635)|
| 4:37:17| with our KPD liaison to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16637)|
| 4:37:20| that it's a good fit on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16640)|
| 4:37:22| So that would be kind of a part that we would both go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16642)|
| 4:37:25| before we would make a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16645)|
| 4:37:29| Thank you, Ms. Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16649)|
| 4:37:31| Ms. Ryder, did any follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| I wanted to put one more follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16653)|
| 4:37:36| I wanted to put one more follow-up comment out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16656)|
| 4:37:41| We have access to social workers and never enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16661)|
| 4:37:45| but there's the social workers at CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16665)|
| 4:37:49| and the social workers through the VMC program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16669)|
| 4:37:53| the street teams that we voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16673)|
| 4:37:55| previous council voted to fund the two with VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16675)|
| 4:37:58| I tapped those teams and asked them to go out quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16678)|
| 4:38:04| And I've explained to constituents at neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16684)|
| 4:38:08| when we used to have them that that is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16688)|
| 4:38:11| more effective and a better result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16691)|
| 4:38:13| than sending out police quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16693)|
| 4:38:15| And the question that I get from constituents is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16695)|
| 4:38:18| well, how do we contact them and let them know ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16698)|
| 4:38:22| Well, I can tell a group of constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| okay, this is the contact person's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16704)|
| 4:38:26| this is the program, look them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16706)|
| 4:38:28| send an ask or send it through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16708)|
| 4:38:31| But the real answer is going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16711)|
| 4:38:33| to that Kahoot style model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16713)|
| 4:38:34| where we are able to do that through a service like 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| And that is something that Councilwoman Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16718)|
| 4:38:41| broached and talked about in the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| we had the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16723)|
| 4:38:45| And so I'll just, while I'm talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16725)|
| 4:38:48| and then I'll shut up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16728)|
| 4:38:50| I feel that we need a minimum of two social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16730)|
| 4:38:53| per district minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16733)|
| 4:38:56| So put my pitch out there that this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16736)|
| 4:39:01| a tiny step that can simultaneously happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16741)|
| 4:39:04| at the same time other things are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16744)|
| 4:39:06| and they need to be because we're way behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16746)|
| 4:39:09| and other partners need to get to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16749)|
| 4:39:15| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| One thing I think that this pilot could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| is gathering information for how to help dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16759)|
| 4:39:25| understand what resources are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16765)|
| 4:39:28| and how they may distinguish between calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| that go to regular law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16770)|
| 4:39:33| to calls that go to this co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16773)|
| 4:39:36| And then that can inform future plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16776)|
| 4:39:39| for what the things you've been describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16779)|
| 4:39:42| Ms. Singh, were you next, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| Yes, just a very quick question, promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16784)|
| 4:39:48| Do we have money in the budget this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| to start researching a different model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16790)|
| 4:39:57| Start working on the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16797)|
| 4:39:59| I'm sure we can find funds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16799)|
| 4:40:02| I don't think there's a budgeted line item for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16802)|
| 4:40:06| but I mean, it's a priority for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16806)|
| 4:40:11| So something we can reallocate staff time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16811)|
| 4:40:15| to researching that, whether it's KBD or our policy teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16815)|
| 4:40:20| or working with community partners, all of that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16820)|
| 4:40:25| but there's not a dedicated budget item at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16825)|
| 4:40:28| And time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16828)|
| 4:40:30| I just don't want it to stop at this one social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16830)|
| 4:40:33| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16833)|
| 4:40:34| Me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16834)|
| 4:40:38| And yeah, I mean, we are looking into all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16838)|
| 4:40:41| right now as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16841)|
| 4:40:44| I mean, we're having these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| and we're trying to prepare for the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16846)|
| 4:40:49| and workshops with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16849)|
| 4:40:51| So the research is happening and I expect to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16851)|
| 4:40:56| all to bring some of the outcomes of this research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16856)|
| 4:41:00| into the budget process in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16860)|
| 4:41:02| Ms. Parker, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16862)|
| 4:41:04| I think you were in the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16864)|
| 4:41:05| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16865)|
| 4:41:07| One's for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16867)|
| 4:41:11| During the budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16871)|
| 4:41:15| Chief Thomas discussed pursuing federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16875)|
| 4:41:20| for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16880)|
| 4:41:23| What happened to those efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16883)|
| 4:41:26| So during the budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16886)|
| 4:41:28| I think I mentioned it last in our council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16888)|
| 4:41:32| that I was hoping that federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16892)|
| 4:41:35| hopefully maybe through the COPS office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16895)|
| 4:41:38| will have to do with this type of funding next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16898)|
| 4:41:42| That's just a hope of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16902)|
| 4:41:45| That's why I'd like to have something on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16905)|
| 4:41:47| so that we can say, here's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| We've explored this option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16909)|
| 4:41:50| or we've explored another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16910)|
| 4:41:52| So if those funds come through perhaps the COPS office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16912)|
| 4:41:56| or some other police related way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16916)|
| 4:41:59| we would be able to have the research done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16919)|
| 4:42:02| and be able to apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16922)|
| 4:42:03| I don't know for sure that that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16923)|
| 4:42:06| I kind of see that's the way things are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16926)|
| 4:42:08| or maybe there'll be some other funds out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16928)|
| 4:42:09| not available to the police agencies, but to cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16929)|
| 4:42:13| So even at that, someone in the city could apply for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16933)|
| 4:42:17| So I don't know that for sure, but that's my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16937)|
| 4:42:22| Okay, so there were no plans to secure the federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16942)|
| 4:42:28| There's no federal funding that we're aware of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16948)|
| 4:42:30| Before the program started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16952)|
| 4:42:34| My other question is on the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16954)|
| 4:42:36| that Councilwoman Fugate brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16956)|
| 4:42:42| that city council can cancel the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16962)|
| 4:42:47| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16967)|
| 4:42:51| Are we able to introduce this contract on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16971)|
| 4:42:55| if we feel that it needs to be canceled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16975)|
| 4:43:02| Mr. Swanson or Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16982)|
| 4:43:03| Can I clarify what I meant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16985)|
| 4:43:06| What I meant was that a contract can be canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16986)|
| 4:43:09| We as city council members do not have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16989)|
| 4:43:13| to cancel a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16993)|
| 4:43:14| but I assume if we're getting reports that we don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200728?start=16994)|
