| 2:20:09| I would probably ask my friends in codes for clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| But as far as staff's concerned, we didn't have any issues with it if the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| themselves didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8420)|
| 2:20:20| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| We're in deliberations now, so it's not appropriate for any further comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| One of the commissioners has a specific question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8431)|

| 2:20:43| When you go down this driveway, and what Jerry is trying to do out there is when they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8443)|
| 2:20:51| down the driveway there, which is probably, oh, a third of a mile or anyway, when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| fire department comes in, or a big truck or anything like that comes in, there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| place, as you can see, for them to get down in there and see there's no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| It's a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| There needs to be a place right there where the road comes down, and then when he cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| that driveway over to the other house, which is already sold, there's no place to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| around, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| And you're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8483)|

| 2:21:51| at it, wouldn't it, isn't that the responsibility of people that live on that joint permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| easement to maintain and to create the type of access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8516)|
