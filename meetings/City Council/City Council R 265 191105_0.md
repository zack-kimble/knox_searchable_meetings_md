| 0:02:08| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| I would like to, I do have an item for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| It will be, I will make a motion on 12AA but I would like a moment if you will indulge me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| This is regarding the rezoning of the property at 1605 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| There has been a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| There's been a lot of research done and a lot of people on both sides of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I want to be very clear that I am an advocate not only for affordable housing but also for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| And there is a distinctive difference in the demographic and population of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| each of those entities serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| With that said, I am not comfortable moving forward with a vote at this time and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| like to ask that, to put forth a motion that we will postpone 12AA until January 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| 2020, which would allow the new council members as well to be part of this discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| this decision moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| This is a motion and a second to postpone 12AA, which has to do with rezoning on 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| for the VMC proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Did you want to speak to that Councilwoman Ryder or is your light on for something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| No, mine is on for different postponements, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=209)|

| 0:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| We have one no, but the postponement passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=221)|

| 0:03:47| are opposed to this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| For anyone that is signed up to speak and they would like to stay and have their comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| heard, it would be appropriate if they've already signed up to have them to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| the end of public forum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| We can do that if council wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| That was the last item prior to public forum, if I recall right, on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| So I have four people signed up against and five people signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| If those members, those folks who signed up, if you want to stay and then speak at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| end of public forum, I mean during public forum, we will hear from you then, but council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| has just passed the motion to postpone this deliberation until January 28th, just so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=269)|
| 0:04:39| know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=279)|

| 0:04:43| Now, Councilwoman, did you have something to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| We're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=285)|

| 0:04:54| That's nobody's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Nobody wants to compete with me on postponing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=298)|

| 0:05:35| audience that might have been here for these agenda items, they'll be heard by Public Property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=335)|

| 0:10:26| with the City's partners in managing a network of wonderfully diverse amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=626)|

| 0:10:45| us a quick update on the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=645)|

| 0:10:54| on this project together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=654)|

| 0:11:13| So you'll see the new park amenities coming into place that create the framework of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| So greenways, connector roads to the neighboring communities, and utilities, and that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| be ongoing throughout the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| And in the spring, you'll see the subsequent phases come into play which layer in the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| like landscaping, the play features, bike trails, and also the bike park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| So it's a really exciting project that will create a true gateway into the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=699)|

| 0:15:58| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Council Member Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| I just want you to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| So just as a little background, the United States Refugee Admissions Program has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| around for some time and this is where the federal government accepts refugees into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| They vet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| They go through a process and then they work with groups like Bridge Refugee Services in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| our community, which I'm sure many of you know and Drisella is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| And so they resettle them across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| It used to be that the Department of State and the United States Refugee Admissions Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| handled that and sent them to different communities around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Now by executive order of President Trump, states and localities basically have to opt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| You have to say yes, we, as we are saying in this, we value the contributions of refugees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| who have come into this country and have been resettled here over the years through Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| Refugee Services, the support of a lot of volunteers and many churches and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| And what this resolution is doing is basically saying to Governor Lee that we encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| to sign on as a state and that we want to sign on as a city to continue what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| since 1982 in our country, which is to help refugees become resettled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| And Bridge Refugee provided some information to me over the years, or just in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| three years, 59 different companies in our city have hired refugees who have come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| representing about 15 different industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| So they come here, many of them after five years, they are eligible to become citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| and as you might know, we've had numerous naturalization ceremonies, we've had several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| this year already and I know there's another one scheduled in a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| And we have many examples of refugees who've come here and done extremely well, served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| our community well, and I'll use Yassin as an example, he didn't come through, he came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| as a political asylee as opposed to through the refugee program, but as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| not only has he started two successful businesses, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| There is Yassin, thank you Yassin for being here, because I brag about you, stand up Yassin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| And as I like to say, it took an immigrant, a refugee, an asylee to come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1117)|
| 0:18:50| and in eight years has put us on the map as the nicest place in America based on Good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| Morning American Reader's Digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| So we certainly have a lot to brag about with our immigrants who have come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| So this is simply a resolution that requests that, says that we want to opt in and we request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| that Governor Leet do it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And I'd like to also call on Darcella to come up and just say a few words if she would as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| the Executive Director, herself a refugee from Rwanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you Mayor, as you said, Knoxville has participated in the Refugee Life Saving Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| since 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| In 2008, I had to flee my country because of political persecution and I didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| my children for two years, nor my husband for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| So while I had to hide for nine months, I was grateful that America gave me a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| to live and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And as you know, the Tennessee welcomed my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Now I have two accountants in the house, I have a flight attendant with United Airlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| I have a nurse serving in Memphis, and my son graduated from University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| They are all young professionals now giving back to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| And within four to six months, those refugees, most of them do not speak English, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| are employable in different sectors and contributing tremendously to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| So and I'm grateful that the City Council also supported the Refugee Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| I think we did get 33,000 for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| Patricia Robredo and Debbie Sharp participate in the monthly consultation meeting, so where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| we update people who is coming, what they are doing in their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| And I want to tell you, concerning the vetting process, I used to come to America on a diplomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| passport, but when I became a refugee, I had to go through the refugee screening process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| which took nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| So refugees are really contributing economically, socially, emotionally to our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| and I just want to keep our doors open to the refugees, and I thank you for supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you, Dressel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| I just wanted to point out, you're having an event at the Bijou Theater this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1283)|
| 0:21:35| What day is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| It's a great event, and music, and a really great fundraiser, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| November 21st, right, at the Bijou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| At the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Oh, yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| One person just signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Denny Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I'm Denny Kidd, 5622 Wallwood, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| I'm here to represent the Center for English, which we're all volunteers, and we teach refugees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| English where they can succeed in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| And I just wanted to say that if they're given the tools to succeed, they are the first to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| be compassionate, because they have suffered without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| They're the first to be compassionate to the poor, because they have suffered poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| They're the first to love education, because many times, the average length of stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| a refugee camp is 24 years now, so they've had a lack of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| So they come here wanting to get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Many of the students that I have had want to be doctors, because they've had a lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| of medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Many of them love America, because they are afforded the freedom of religion, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| have experienced a lack of that in their countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| They're the first to give job opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Yes, this is a great example of that, to people coming out of prison, because they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| in bondage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| They're the first to be kind to the homeless, because they have been homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| And they're the first to care about mental illness, because they have experienced war| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| They're the first to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| We just had a student's son sign up for the armed forces, because he has experienced war| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| firsthand, and he knows that America has freedoms afforded to him that he did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| in the country that he came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I hope that all of us don't have to experience what a refugee has had to experience to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| compassion for one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1450)|

| 0:24:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| And I would like to encourage everyone, we will send this resolution to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| I will also sign on through the State Department on behalf of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| But I encourage everyone, contact the governor's office, and tell him that you support him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| signing on, opting in, basically, for the state of Tennessee to continue to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| on what we've done for many, many years and done very successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| If you need any more information, please contact Bridge Refugee Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| They can provide you with anything you might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| But just a call or an email to the office and saying, please continue to support refugee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| resettlement in our state will go a long way as he contemplates what his decision will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1504)|

| 0:25:47| and with representatives from Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| This is such a special community, Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| There are so many of them in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I was really fortunate to work closely with students and community members and faculty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| from Lonsdale when I worked at Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| It's a community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| So, one of the things that I wanted to just give a shout out to Mr. Oaks and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| schools for how well they have worked with the community to make sure that what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| at the school now is meeting the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| And I know that the school district and the county and the city will continue working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| together to make sure the community is engaged in the design process for the facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| to make sure that the facility ends up being something that's really wonderful and helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| enrich and enhance that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| One of the pieces of that that I think is going to be really important, and again this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| is more a comment than anything, is to make sure that that walkable community considers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| pedestrians and all of the students who will be walking to and from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| Oftentimes, schools today are built in a more suburban style that's geared towards cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| and that may seem like a really small detail, but I think particularly in our city, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| schools that are within our city limits, it's really important to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| So, I wanted you to hear that, Mr. Oaks, because I know that that's something you'll keep in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| mind as the site is designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1634)|

| 0:32:39| So, everybody just gets five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| So, you should make your statement now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| I'll do it in five minutes of rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| No, you have to do it now is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Oh, I have to do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Yeah, according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| First, we have the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| And then we have the opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| So, are you telling us that you think the respondent is going to ask for a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| You're not going to object to that and then there's going to be a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| And that's why you're not going to exercise your time now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| If that's the case, counsel may wish to amend their rules in this instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| to allow the respondent to go first and to allow him to have, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| a two-minute rebuttal following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I'd make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Okay, so we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Okay, so Mr. Moore, Dan Moore, please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| and I'll set the timer and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Mayor and counsel, my name is Daniel Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| My office address is 900 South Gay Street, Suite 900, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| I'm here on behalf of Kelly and Beverly Milam and they live on Osprey Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| Their address is 936 Osprey Point Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Their house is at the very end of the cul-de-sac that's affected by this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| And they have been consistently opposed to efforts to rezone this property for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| It was first rezoned in 2012 to its current zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| and that was in response to an effort to rezone it to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| It's now O1 and they would like it to remain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and they are opposed to any zoning effort that would turn this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| into a commercial zoning rather than an office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Their primary concern is that the commercial activities at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| are primarily on the north side of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And by design, I think that's what the zoning staff has indicated in their report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| The primary reason for the way the zoning is currently is to provide a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| between the commercial activities on the north side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| and the residential activities on the south side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| So their preference is that it remain O1 and not create extra traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| and activity that a commercial zone would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| So they're in opposition to the effort to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| There will be a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| So you're not asking for a postponement, you're just asking for a denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I didn't come here to ask for a postponement, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| We would like it to be denied completely, but if a postponement is what's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| to try to rectify the issue, then we wouldn't oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| But I think our primary concern is that it not happen at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and I'm not sure that we can come to a resolution based on a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Mr. Kline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| Well, I am surprised. Completely surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| So I'll use my time to tell you that we vetted this entire conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| this issue before the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| The whole purpose is that the developer wants to develop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| in a neighborhood commercial zone with low roofline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| and lights down in a dish that has a tremendous buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| both behind it, then Osprey Point Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and then a buffer to the subdivision behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| These folks live, they can't even see the place from their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| The TM3 Properties wants to develop this, not as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And so that's why we moved for a neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Just two stores with low roofs, no parking behind the shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and the MPC said, that's a great idea, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| We did it at Westland Drive in Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| We did it out at North Shore and Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and MPC recommended this approval, this change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| And we would request the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Let me, I guess, start by asking a few questions of Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| Currently this space is zoned office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and it's being asked to be changed to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Is there a height difference in the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| that could be built in an office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| versus a place that was zoned neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| This is Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| The height limit in the neighborhood commercial is 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and the office one is 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| And is there a requirement for any kind of buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| landscaping buffer or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| that you'd be looking at that might be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| in neighborhood commercial versus in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| There are no requirements for landscape buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| under our current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| The newly adopted zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| that's projected effective date of January 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| does require a 20-foot landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| between non-residential uses and residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| How much was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Now, from my look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| and the photographs in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| it looks to me like there is already a pretty significant buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| in between the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| that Mr. Moore is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| and the proposed site that Mr. Kline is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| would those additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| those are outside of the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| that we're talking about for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| would those additional feet of buffer be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| So would you have more of a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| if this project was to go into effect in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Mr. Moore, if I could ask you a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Have the folks that you represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| have they had an opportunity to talk to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I don't believe they have actually talked to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| about this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| I don't know whether the Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| across the street has had any conversations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I don't represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I only represent the Milam's at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| But I don't know whether those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Maybe Mr. Kline can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Go ahead, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| There were two meetings scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| before the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| and everybody in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| including the Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and the Milam's got an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| They didn't attend, but we were there for the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and we had meetings with some of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Moore, you've heard some of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I had with Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| The change that is being proposed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| would have less of a height possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| than what you currently could have built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Do you think that will have an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| on what your clients would want to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| Well, I could certainly discuss that with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| and see how they would feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| I think their primary objection, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| is not so much to the design of the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| but to the excess traffic that's created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| because it's commercial versus office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Office use is, you know, less open hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| no weekends, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| The hours of operation usually end by 5, 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| With the commercial activity going on on that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| there'll be traffic in and out of there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| at additional hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| creating more traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| for people getting in and out of Osprey Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| on that side of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So it's primarily a safety issue for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| I think, more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Director Green is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| obviously office is meant to be a transition space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| between commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Would the same be true with neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| The neighborhood commercial is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| somewhat of a transition zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| and has been used for that purpose in some locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| The uses permitted in the neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| are less impactful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| than those permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| in the higher classification commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And Mr. Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| I know you said you weren't asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| for a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| What...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Maybe some of the things you've learned this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| about this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| it might be a good idea to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| and talk to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| and to your clients about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| One thing that I think is particularly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| is I know that in the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| that we've seen from Mr. Kline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| there's a pretty hefty amount of barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| in between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| blocking the view of this from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| If this was to be implemented in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| then there would be additional blockage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| that would be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I guess what I would ask Mr. Kline is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| you know, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Would you be willing to have a two-week delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| so that maybe this wouldn't be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| until the new year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| and then they would have that extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| amount of screening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Practically speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| we wouldn't start till the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Because we wouldn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Even if it were passed on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| and then second reading in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| we wouldn't have engineers on site till after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| you'd have to go through a concept plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| So, no, we wouldn't start till the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| We anticipate recode applying to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| That's why if you see exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| these preliminary site plan exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| in your packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| there's a huge buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| behind these proposed retail shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Of just two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| 3,000 square feet, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| So, Mr. Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I think where I'm left with on this then is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| you know, I see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| you've got some benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| to the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| It's probably not going to go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| until these new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| shielding rules will go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| so you'll have more of a barrier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I'd be willing to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| It's not going to set the developer back any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| That gives you some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| to talk to your clients about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| some of the things we've had to discuss today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I mean, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| I think this piece of property will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| get developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| and I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| gives you an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| have some voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| in what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Is that something you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| or do you want us to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| and deal with this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I think if Council is willing to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| the first reading for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I think my clients would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| probably not object to that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Mr. Kline, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I'd just make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| that we postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| I just wanted to clarify with Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I think I know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| but are there tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| already in queue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| for these parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| or is it just speculative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Like, they'll look for tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| There's one tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| So there is a tenant lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Out of two in the queue already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Is that something that was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| So it's not under wraps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| I doubt if I have permission to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I'm not going to make you do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| on public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| but I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| You said you guys had met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| and I wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| if that was part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| since it wasn't mentioned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Who's the tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Oh, I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I'm not going to make him do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| on public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| He has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Oh, I thought it was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| This is just for 12-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Then we'll have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2718)|

| 0:49:36| Hi, I was wondering if you could just give us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| information about the plans for the parcel and how it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| add to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Currently, right now, the ballpark is short on parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| One of the things that we're looking to do is enhance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| parking or expand that parking into that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| It's right there next to the entrance to the park, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| actually is congested, which we've had issues in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| with getting emergency vehicles into the park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| So that will help us alleviate and open up the throat of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| that drive coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| And the property has been sitting there for as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I've been affiliated with the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| It's been sitting there vacant and landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| So this would actually also resolve that landlocked piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| of property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| So will you guys also be increasing the width of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| entrance there to car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Is that my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| No, that drive, no, we would not be widening that drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| coming into the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3036)|

| 0:56:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3397)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Now to answer your question council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| The sector plan for this property does show office use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| The sector plan is 12 years old during the development of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| city's new zoning code we've heard from many different parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| of the city that there was a need for more housing range of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| housing types and this area does provide a limited amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| housing and staff had a 12 year old sector plan and more recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| direction and wanting some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| The best way to get clarity is often to put a hold on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| rezoning and ask for direction from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| and ultimately from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| The planning commission considered this discussed it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| some length and felt that this neighborhood had pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| changed to office and that the sector plan was correct and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| the need for housing while very real not be met by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| neighborhood and as Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Bergen said they voted pretty overwhelmingly to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| rezoning request to office for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| So staff took that policy direction and this area will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| continue to abide by the sector plan and the change from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| residential to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| So what I'm hearing from you then is that this area has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| in transition for probably some time moving away from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| and into an office area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3478)|
| 0:57:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| And then when the maps go into effect in January of 2020 this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| area is actually going to be changed to R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| The remaining residential properties will go to R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| The office the property is currently designated office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| this property council does approve the rezoning will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| designated as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| And in that R and 4 zoning that would permit for some non| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| residential uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| It would allow for for churches related uses and home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Based on that I would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3523)|

| 0:59:55| We have a public forum and as we stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3595)|

| 1:01:18| about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| All right, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| My name is Constance Every 301 North Charlie Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Since the agenda item that I was going to speak on has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| tabled, I'm going to wait till January to speak on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I'm just going to exercise my right at public forum at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| point and speak publicly about the generalization of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| that I have and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| So with that being said, you know, in kind of concept with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| the whole thing, that reason why the park issue was here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| present today was really addressing public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| And as I've expressed to some of the members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| housing and as I've expressed to some of the members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| community of Park Ridge that reached out to me personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| and asked for my presence here today, I expressed to some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| those who support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| And my support concern for you all is that as I've said many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| times with this mic, the city has had numerous opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| to address housing, particularly affordable and homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| You know, we have had multiple properties that could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| easily addressed this particular concern, yet the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| always chosen to do the total opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| One that comes in mind particularly still to this day, St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Mary's Hospital that is going to go to the police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| department that could officially have served as a homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| housing effective immediately because it was still a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| with rooms, beds, and bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| We could have officially made that into a homeless housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| location effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Another spot that comes to mind, which is always going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| disturbing because that's where we got a big outpour of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| homeless population from, is the Lakeshore building that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| serves as the Park and Rec's administrative office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| That should have never stopped being what it was, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| a mental health ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| So that's another building that easily could have remained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| what it was and helped further address our issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Also, another building that comes to mind, and this is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I said for Warren Knoxville, pay attention to who you vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| for, and the reason why we don't vote entertainers into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| office is like people like Glenn Jacobs who want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| rural high school and tear it down for millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| is another location that could have been used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So, when we talk about housing issues, period, and weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| ago, Madeline Rojas said herself, we have 4,500 housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| units, which I'm sure many of us in the public today are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| still wondering where those houses are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| This is why we have issues because these leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| individuals don't listen to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| So guess what, Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| We are exactly about 55 minutes away from polls closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| We are roughly about two hours away for the new day that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| I have been hoping and waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| This is why you vote, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| This is why you learn the platforms of your candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| This is why you make sure that your representation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Aren't you sick of the affluent and wealthy to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| only representation of voice here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Aren't you sick of every time that you meet with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| local representations at your community functions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| even here in these spaces where we come and publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| talk to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Aren't you sick of having this conversation and deaf ears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| are not listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Then I suggest, Knoxville, you go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| That's how we start to make these changes effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| today, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| And then as I said before, we are still waiting on police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| The police department is out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| This weekend alone, three black cops at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| Black cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3872)|
| 1:04:32| I keep saying black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| What is wrong with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Why are we the most unloyal to ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Everybody else in their nationality is loyal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| themselves, but the black population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| And we got black cops coming to black spaces in black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| community areas, criminalizing their own black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| But the last time I checked, Blue Lives Matter has never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| stood up for the black cops when they get caught up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| the wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| So black cops, I'm confused at what you're doing, period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| And as we continue on many other things, waste of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| We are spending money left and right and not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| appropriate places still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| We are still dealing with multiple issues with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3908)|
| 1:05:08| We are still dealing with predators in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Knoxville has 255 unsolved murder cases to date today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And one of those black cops that was harassing black people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| He's a homicide detective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| I wish he would use that same energy towards solving some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| of these murder cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3924)|
| 1:05:24| You have one minute, one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| So some of these families can have closure to their losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| This is the reality we're dealing with and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Knoxville, you have to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3933)|

| 1:06:17| It's time for community care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| On a national level, our country is spending trillions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| dollars to build weapons of mass destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| That's almost over 200 million daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| HUD has cut housing vouchers and programs for housing are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| being defunded at an historical rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| There are now working homeless, encampments, and tent cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| as people can't afford the rents and the good paying living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| wage is not available to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| In Knoxville, Tennessee, there are more renters than homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| and all rent is becoming insecure with gentrification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| no housing for the very low income citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| The increasing number of aged out youth, the growing number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| of elderly who have no home, even those veterans who we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| thank for their service next week as they sleep on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Homelessness can be solved with economic solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| Everyone should be able to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| We have created a spirit of abandonment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| We are walling off our own people within our own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| We are creating a have and a have not society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| We are developing a I don't care, I care attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| We must acknowledge this on all levels, especially here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| Knoxville as our great city continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| We must live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| And we must find ways to restore those who have lost all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| There are those concerning this issue who say they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| to live near them because they are nasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| If we don't help each other, we are the nasty ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| We are nasty in our hearts and we are nasty in the sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| of our provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4110)|

| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Rebecca Parr, 4315 Emanuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| That's 37920 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| So I'm here to speak in support of this housing going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| I had the great fortune some years ago to be a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Liaison Committee for Flinnegan and there was a lot of pushback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| at that time about what that would look like in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And though I don't live in the community where this housing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| being proposed, I live less than a mile from Flinnegan and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| understood that some of the alternative proposals were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| going to be adequate for what we need in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And you know the need, you of all people, definitely know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| need that we have for housing, particularly for the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| marginalized individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| That particular project has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| The residents there are very well vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| They also have a lot of case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| There have not been issues and they've been embraced within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| The amenities that are nearby are not going to be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| The amenities that are nearby serve the population and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| more and more models just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| And from what I understand this model, even though it's limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| in terms of how many units we'll have, I understand from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| last meeting that I attended there will be 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| Be great to have a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| But if we look at this as a continuation of a model that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| working and that these individuals will be well vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4251)|

| 1:10:59| not just a seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| This is the seedling that needs to happen in many places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| throughout our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Integrated housing makes a difference in where people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| lives change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| If you have individuals who are put into a community and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| surround where they are made to feel and be treated as though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| they are just like everybody else, it has a tendency to rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| up those individuals and then that creates more space for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| next round of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| And we need as a community to be doing that in as many places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Not just East, not just South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| We need to go West, North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| We need to go everywhere in our community and find other pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| and places that have amenities nearby where there, well, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| more grocery stores in that area, but where there are bus lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| and places that people can walk to get to the parks and get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| the different spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And it has been a successful program in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| I don't see why we don't look at that as a model and take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4326)|
| 1:12:06| So I encourage all of you to look a little closer what has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| on with Menvilla, with Flennican and see how it's been a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| I think most all of you know that I work very closely in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Knoxville with our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| I wish we had larger plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| I work very closely with a lot of the folks at Volunteer Ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| Center, and I know that they will do tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| They already do a tremendous job at bringing services for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| So I guess I'll be coming back in January and talking again and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| encouraging you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| And if we have more conversations around this, I'd love to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Please consider what this means for all of our community and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| we are as a population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| I listened to the tail end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I got here a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| I heard Miss Vivian talking a little bit about some of why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| need to care, but we are one city, one community, and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| to all be in this together and care about our fellow man, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| just as it's convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| I think that's about all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4398)|

| 1:14:05| many wearing red, and I ask that they stand at this moment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4451)|

| 1:14:20| composed of 15 congregations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| We build people power to address serious problems within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Justice Knox fully supports the Volunteer Ministry Center's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| proposal for supportive housing on East 5th Avenue, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| the city's proposed rezoning and transfer of property to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I also know that neighbors in Park Ridge, there are many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| us who support this proposal from that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Justice Knox knows from the stories that we have heard in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| all of our congregations and the research that we have conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| in both our mental health and housing campaigns that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| supportive housing and we need it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| And so we are extremely disappointed that you have delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| We understand that part of the VMC making this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| financially is dependent on VMC taking possession of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Even if a project is in jeopardy, people will continue to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| on streets for almost three more months because of this delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| I am angry that when I walk outside my church, it is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| unusual for me to encounter a half dozen or more people camped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| out in our large tunnel, which has become a haven for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| I am angry because these people should not have to exist on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| a square of concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| This is not only shameful, but it is inhumane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| We have gotten to know these people at our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| We offer them food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| We offer them clothing and other help, but we don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| capability to help them in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Not only have I seen homelessness at my church, but it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| personally affected my neighbors and me in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| About a year and a half ago, I noticed an unfamiliar car parked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| outside my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| This car returned again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Sometimes I'd see a woman sitting inside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Eventually the car parked and it did not move and it is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| that I realized that this woman was living inside her car outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| my property and this concerned me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| One, I didn't know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| I didn't know her situation and there's no reason for her to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| live inside her house, inside her car, especially when it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| becoming very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| And so a neighbor and I met her and learned her story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| I know this woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Her name is Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Evelyn is homeless and she struggles with severe mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| issues, but she felt so unsafe at the shelter she'd been referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| to that she chose instead to live on the street in her car in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| This is shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| This is inhumane and this is inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| We need this affordable safe housing for some of our most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| vulnerable neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| People living on the streets cannot wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| This land in the Park Ridge neighborhood is situated well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| access the bus line as well as services such as the VMC in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| With Justice Knox and others in my neighborhood, I am in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| of this ordinance and the VMC's proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4639)|

| 1:17:48| Today, along with Justice Knox, I urge City Council to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| the city's zoning request and transfer of property to Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4673)|

| 1:18:06| Of those 65 years, I have lived in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| The space that we are talking about has never been thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| of as a park by people that I knew who lived in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| When I was younger, there was houses on the part of that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| but really it was just always labeled a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| There was a cut through the alley that took us to Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4707)|

| 1:18:40| I live a little farther east, but I regularly drive down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| I rarely see someone in lot that we're talking about, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| the people I know who still live there never considered this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| space a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Yes, we need green space, but there is a huge park with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| beautiful playground very close to this space and a nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| community park with green space right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| We don't just need parks, people also need homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| We have too many people without homes who live on our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| and city in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| If I could not live with my daughter at this point, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| not afford a decent home in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| I'm a lifetime member of Tabernacle Baptist Church in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Knoxville. In recent years, we have opened our doors in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| winter to house some of the homeless men so they can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| a warm place during the winter months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| They should not have to rely on churches to open their doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| when they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| We have to balance our needs for parks and with the people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| need to have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I strongly support the city's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| It is good for our neighbors who do not have homes and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| good for our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4815)|
| 1:20:24| Let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| I've got one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Okay, Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| Is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Hughes still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| My name is Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| I live at 1119 Alexander Street, apartment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you for the chance to address this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| As a community organizer and a concerned Knoxville resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| I consider working for housing justice to be among my most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| important priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I have addressed the council on proposed developments before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| and helped to coordinate and present a canvas on energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| burden in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Earlier this year, I was proud to participate in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| negotiation for the largest community benefits plan ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| signed between a bank and local communities to provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| access to homeownership to underserved communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| But I come before you today also as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I live about a mile from Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| It is the closest major park to me and I've gone there often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| I am also a neighbor of the residents of MinnVilla Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| another Volunteer Ministry Center property, and I'm proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| to share my neighborhood with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Finally, I am a neighbor of many Knoxville residents who lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| We share the same streets and I know we must do better by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| It is for these reasons I support this rezoning and transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| of land to VMC and I encourage the council to facilitate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| process as quickly as possible and to find a legal way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| restore the original 47-unit plan for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Having heard the debate on both sides of this issue, I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| convinced that this represents a well-considered, entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| appropriate plan that will help those most in need turn their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| lives around in vital ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| The site has everything that's needed for an effective permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| supporting housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| It's located right next to vital supportive services, directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| on a KUB bus line with easy access to the downtown and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| most of the major nearby corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Folks without homes are so often the final priority in a city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| future when they are considered at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I'm proud that in this case my city has taken a proactive role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| in working with a local agency to develop such a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I also understand the concerns raised by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| As an athlete and an environmentalist, I use Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Parks multiple times a week and I know the importance of green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| space to a healthy community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| I encourage the council to hear the concerns of residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Park Ridge and surrounding neighborhoods, and I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| can work together to develop a park space that can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| more benefit than the narrow patch of hillside in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| But this plan has been public since May and you've had more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| than enough time to consider feedback and make an informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| I've sat in these seats on projects like this many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| before and I've seen, as you must, that no plan for a portable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| public, or supportive housing fails to draw some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| There is no alternative that will satisfy everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| When families without homes are given the least desirable, least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| accessible, and most cramped housing options, they simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| don't have the surroundings they need to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| In closing, I want to speak to the importance of getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| project done and done as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Growing up, my family didn't always have a stable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| situation, especially when we had to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| During one period, we lived in a series of hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| During another, my mother, two brothers, and I had to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| into my grandmother's small house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| This was not easy on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| However, my family always had a security blanket, a relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| who could help cover rent, someone we could live with for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| a few weeks, a connection that helped us find something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| I often wonder what might have happened if we didn't have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Would we have had significant gaps in our education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Would my parents have been able to find and maintain stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Would our lives have spiraled into an unrecoverable situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| There are families in Knoxville facing this very question as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Above all else, I implore you to consider the human costs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| At heart, the question you face now, in two months, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| throughout your terms in office is, how do we get as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| individuals, families, and children into warm and safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| homes, and how do we do it as quickly as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| For these reasons, I encourage you to support this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| and transfer, and to see that this and other permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| supportive housing projects are completed as quickly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5111)|
| 1:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5111)|

| 1:25:19| David Lee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| We had called you previously, and you weren't here, so go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Please state your name and address for the record, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| My name is David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| I live at 4519 Owanna Drive, Knoxville 379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Knoxville 37914, and I'm speaking on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| Board of Town Hall East, and we would like to support our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| colleagues in the Park Ridge Neighborhood Association in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| requesting that you turn down the resolution based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| principle that we do not wish to diminish park lands in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| We were very impressed at the public meeting held in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| headquarters of the Urban League at the support for the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| project that seemed to be very sincere and very evident in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| neighborhood itself, and I think that you risk losing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| support if the transfer is not done in the proper manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| We were also very encouraged to read in the letter that Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| Rojero sent to the Neighborhood Association suggesting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| possibility that vacant land in the proximity of the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5213)|

| 1:27:11| I think that you have the possibility there for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| compromise that could really satisfy most parties, and I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| that you can go down the path of that compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5246)|

| 1:27:28| Okay, Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5248)|

| 1:27:45| I'm privileged to be the CEO of the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| Mayor and council members, thank you for this opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| speak very briefly with you, but as we have heard, it cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| overstated the need for permanent supportive housing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| It's been nearly a decade since supportive housing has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| built, and right now there's at least 53 individuals who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| known by name who could use permanent supportive housing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| But I do want to remind us all that permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| housing is not shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| The reference as homeless housing for me is both a misnomer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| and maybe an attempt to suggest that the residents are less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| than or more dangerous than any other renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Permanent supportive housing is housing and it is permanent as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| the resident pays rent while receiving a level of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| that helps them because of a disabling condition that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| led to a long duration of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| As we know, permanent supportive housing is effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| We know that from national models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| We also know it from local models and Volunteer Ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Center knows it personally or collectively, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| Menville-O-Manor is now entering its 10th year of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| The average length of tenancy in Menville-O-Manor is 4.6 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5358)|

| 1:29:36| With the advantage of housing and with wraparound case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| 100% of the residents now are accessing case management support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| and engaging in some medical or oral health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| Also, 90% of the residents who report a mental health condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| are receiving services relative to that condition and 80% of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| residents either gain or maintain income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| A modest one, however, but still an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| I'm sure that Flinnegan Landing, as well as Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Permanent Supportive Housing Opportunity supports similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| results and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| Though we are disappointed with the delay tonight, I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| to working with a new administration and a new seated council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| to work for a remedy for more permanent supportive housing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| There is no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| The property on East 5th is advantageous to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| It would be easy to develop, be easy to manage, but we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| forward to the new administration and working with us as we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| that the need for permanent supportive housing cannot be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| But I want to take a personal moment to thank Mayor O'Hara for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| your willingness and your commitment to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara for your willingness and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| commitment to reducing and eliminating the experience of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| It's through your policies and through your advocacy that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| have seen change, that I have seen change on the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| Corridor through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Becky Wade and her office have been faithful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| They've been diligent, effective, and compassionate in enlivening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| your policy, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| And to this council, I express my thanks for your willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| to embrace and yes, sometimes support efforts that may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| bring you accolades, but makes a huge difference in the lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| of those who have huge burdens, who struggle in ways that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| cannot begin to imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I know that as a community that we're strong enough to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| the burden of those who struggle, wise enough to reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| experience of homelessness or prevent its experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| And yes, my friends, and yes, my neighbors, we are capable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| capable enough to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| Dr. Stangler, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5528)|
| 1:32:20| I want to say something before I call on Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| I want to thank VMC and all the work that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| You have been tremendous partners these past eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| for me as Mayor and the four years as Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| Director. And for everyone who is here, who works on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| issue, I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| I want to also recognize Mike Dunthorne in our Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| Homelessness and Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| And I don't know how many people realized this, but, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| hope this is okay, Becky, but throughout this time, just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| the last few months, Becky has lost both of her parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| We buried both of them just Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| And so she, through the MPC, she wasn't at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| because her mother was in her home in hospice and died two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Becky has had tremendous burden on her shoulders during this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| time, but yet she has continued to serve people in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| community and to do, and to do her job as Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5602)|
| 1:33:22| And I just want to publicly say how much we appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| and that our hearts go out to you and your family, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| particularly for the fabulous job you have done for eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| years, plus the years you worked with me in Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| I have to say that whenever many partners are with us at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness, including Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Clinton, Chief Thomas, sometimes Captain Jones, and the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| on the street will tell you that the biggest need that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| have is permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| You know, they see that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| They know Officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| You all know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| He knows the individuals by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| He knows their stories, just like many of our, the workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| do at CAC and VMC and CARM and our other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| And this, this, this is an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| And it's one that in Community Development, when Flinnegan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| approved on a 5-4 vote, when Menvilla was approved on a 5-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| vote, it's always controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| But I know that, and I want to thank the neighbors who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| shared all kinds of information, who are opposed to it, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| I know they are passionate also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| And, and I hope, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Lee said, when he came up here, that over these next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| a couple months, I guess, that both sides can get together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| to talk about this and, and, and see how we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| I tried to explain to the community why, you know, we are, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| said in my letter that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Lee referenced to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Randazzo, the president, we've got two things that we care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| We care about parks in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| And I don't think, I mean, we've done a tremendous work, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| this and prior councils and our administration, to expand parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| We also have a need to expand permanent supportive housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| to address issues of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| And, and looking at this particular site and the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| there for it really, for VMC to be able to place a site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5743)|
| 1:35:51| would serve at least 24, in addition to the positively lending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| positively living community that they will be managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| It's a tremendous opportunity to really bring some outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| services to the folks who, as I said, many of us know by name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| who need this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| We want to work with the community, not in conflict like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| but how can we address park space, create, improve the area as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| have been identified, the, the rubble yard and other parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| that community, of that park area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| Look at opening the fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| We're working on that to look at ways we can open the fences to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| make it more accessible to people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| So we'll have more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| I only have until, I only have, you know, six more weeks, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| we'll pass on what we know to the next administration and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| five council members will continue on, four new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| will come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Maybe, let's look at how we can get a win-win for everybody on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| We hear the folks in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| We hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Okay, we hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| And so let's, let's look at how, working with Councilwoman McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| how we address bettering the parkland that you have, you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| our mind, and I think, let me say this, I think there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| real, in the heat of battle, a lot of things get said, but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| approached it, as I said in the letter, that ever since the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| was purchased and it was determined that parking would not go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| those three lots, under, while that administration, the Ashe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| administration was still in place, the sector plan changed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| area to anticipating mixed-use and residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| So since, in my reading of, if I'm wrong, y'all can tell me later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| but, and we looked at it in 2003, the sector plan anticipated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5876)|
| 1:38:06| that would be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| When the 2011 open space issues happened, you know, with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| and a lot of stuff was rezoned to OS2, that was in like in 11, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| think, in 2014, when the sector plan was updated, again, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| three lots were shown, not as open space, but anticipated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| there would be development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Now, you may not agree that that's what should happen, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| doesn't make us wrong when we say that that's the way the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| plan reads, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| So, so I'm hugely disappointed in the attacks that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| personally on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| I get it all the time, so it's, I don't care, but, I mean, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| care, but it's part of my job, but we looked at what the anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| use of those lots had, were set out, set out twice, in 03 and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| 014, after the park was bought, after the OS2 zoning was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| And so there's, and so you can question, is that the right sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I mean, is that the right proposed future zoning for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| You can question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| And that's what this is about, is deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| What is the proper use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| What is the best use of that land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And so if it's parkland, we don't want to give up, because you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| see it as parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| We see it as land adjacent to the park that our park, literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| our Parks and Rec Department has, does not program it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| They don't consider it part of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| But y'all want more parkland, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| So let's see if we can't make that happen, you know, to where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| development can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| And Park Ridge doesn't have to lose any more green space, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| but can get even more, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| So let's, instead of the negative approach that we've had, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6004)|
| 1:40:14| the hostile approach, I have to say, from some people, let's try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| ratchet it down and figure out what a compromise is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| You know, and they're going to be some pretty exciting discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| about some opportunities in Park Ridge soon, which we can't talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| But, and so let's, so all of this will kind of be unfolding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| So if we can kind of step back from the hostility and for whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6038)|
| 1:40:46| I have done to bring that out in you, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| We don't want to approach this in a hostile manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Let's sit down and talk about whether there's a way to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| You know, and ultimately this council and the next mayor, part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| this council and the new council and the next mayor will make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| So that's all I have to say, I guess, but thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| Thank you for staying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Thanks to council for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| And there's still a lot of work to be done, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| So if there's no, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| I would still like to share something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Most of it has to do, you've covered, but what I wanted to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| was the hostility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| It's really amazed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Most of the people that are here from Park Ridge, I consider my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| friends and I've had lots of good discussions with and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| will continue to even after this issue is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| But the amount of venom that I've gotten on email today and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| coming to my house because my belief system on this, this is, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| isn't how civics goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I love when people are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I love to hear from constituents, but we need to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| that's respectful and I'll continue to engage in that way, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| don't want to open up email like I did today and I hope we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| continue this conversation in January politely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6150)|
| 1:42:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| If there's no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191105?start=6156)|
