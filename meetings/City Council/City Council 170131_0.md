| 0:03:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=204)|

| 0:03:27| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| For the Mayor's report, I would like to start off by saying a few words about recent events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| both at the national and the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We don't usually talk too much about national issues here, but I do want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| everyone understands the position of this administration on the recent executive orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| on immigration and refugees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| And if you look on our city blog, on our Facebook post, and on Twitter, you will see some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| the comments and reactions that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Also, we are in touch with a couple different organizations of cities and mayors across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| the country who are addressing a lot of these issues, and on phone calls with them to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| up to date with what's happening and how that affects our cities and our residents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| In fact, tomorrow the U.S. Conference of Mayors has called a conference call with those of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| us who are on the U.S. Conference of Mayors leadership team, the various boards there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| And so we'll be talking about immigration issues, health care, the ACA, how that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| affect the changes that are being proposed, how it might affect our residents, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| safety, and other topics like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| But throughout these discussions, some people have asked whether Knoxville is a sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| And the short answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| You may have had some of your constituents may have asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| We've never identified ourselves that way, and even there's no single definition of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| It's confusing out there on what it actually means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| But it typically means some level of reluctance or total denial of cooperation with federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| immigration officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| And so for the record, we have always complied with federal laws and cooperated with federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| officials as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| But it's also important for people to know that our local law enforcement, our police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| are not immigration officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| When they respond to a call, they don't ask for immigration or citizenship status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| They never have, because it's not their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| I've talked extensively with Chief Rausch about this, and he and I both believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| it is crucial, and this has been the policy for some time in our city, that it's crucial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| that everybody in our city feel safe when they have to call for help, when they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| help and they need it, when they need to be able to call us and feel like we'll respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| It makes it safer for everybody when people feel comfortable in calling us when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| We don't want people who are in danger or suffering from some kind of abuse to be afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| to call 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| We are here to protect and serve everybody in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| At the same time, if there is evidence of a crime, if somebody needs to be arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| because they've been involved in criminal activity, KPD will arrest them also, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| of their immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| So more broadly, while we are not a sanctuary city, we are and will remain a welcoming city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| a welcoming city to people of all races, ages, genders, ethnicities, nationalities, and religions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| To me, this is a moral and a philosophical position, but it's also an economic one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Many of the most successful businesses in our region serve international markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| The University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Lab benefit tremendously from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| talents of international students, faculty, and scientists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| Our children and grandchildren are growing up in a world that is increasingly connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| increasingly diverse, and increasingly global in all respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| For their sake and ours, now is not the time for us to close our doors or our hearts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Some of you have probably saw the short film that Square.com premiered here in town last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| week about Yasin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| We know many of you have eaten at Yasin's Falafel House on Walnut Street, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| haven't, I highly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| It's a real gathering spot for people, again, of all ages, races, religions, sexual orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| It is open to everyone, and people flock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| So you can find that film online if you haven't seen it, but it really shows the American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| dream from the point of view of a refugee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| Yasin came here from Syria, one of the countries that we are now closing the borders to, at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| least temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| His family was scattered by the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| He worked his way up from selling sandwiches at the mosque here in Knoxville to opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| his own restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Now he is a fixture of our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| He is civic-minded, very active in the community, and he has hired other refugees to work at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yasin is a Syrian, a Muslim, a refugee, and he's also a really great Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| And so that's a great example of how we all benefit from being a welcoming community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| So as we move forward, as we see what all of this means, one of the concerns is if in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| fact there's laws that come down that say that our police have to be immigration officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| then we will work with other city mayors and the U.S. Conference of Mayors to stop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| from happening because, number one, it's an unfunded federal mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| Typically, that's what happens, and we need to be doing our job, and we don't think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| keeps our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| We think that ICE should do ICE's job and law enforcement should do their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| And of course, we've talked before about the need for sensible immigration reform is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=548)|
| 0:09:19| we need, actually, is what I think most of the mayors that I know and the U.S. Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| of Mayors we've been calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| So anyway, just wanted to keep you all up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| If any of you have questions about that on our positions or how we're responding or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| action we're taking, don't hesitate to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Same with the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| So in more local news, tomorrow morning we'll have an announcement of some good news for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| the Broadway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| We all know that there's a lot of congestion there if you drive it, and it affects both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| people in cars and those riding the CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| So this announcement is something that should provide some help with all of that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| So I hope you all can join me at 10.45 a.m. at the CAT bus shelter near Virginia College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| which is at 5003 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| We'll actually be taking the bus from the transit station at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| If anybody wants to park and ride the bus with us up there, it's Route 22, leaving at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| 10 a.m. from the downtown station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Also coming up, as Council knows, is our annual budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| That will be next Friday, February 10th, at the new Public Work Service Center at 3131| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| We'll have a light breakfast starting at 8.30 with our presentations beginning at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| As always, you will get a mid-year budget update from our Finance Director, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| and then we'll talk about some of our major projects and initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| So I hope, I know we'll see Council there, and of course the public is invited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Any Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=659)|

| 0:11:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| 8C is a resolution confirming the Mayor's appointments to the Public Stakeholder Advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Committee, an ad hoc advisory group of citizens to provide feedback on the proposed update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| to the City of Knoxville Zoning Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| It looks like a fantastic group here selected, at least 19 of the 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=710)|
| 0:11:59| No, just joking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| It does look like a great group, but I just wanted to make it clear to those in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| and watching, there is going to be time for any member of the public to comment during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| There's going to be times for the public to comment, developers or neighborhood people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| that they're going to be able to have their say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I just wanted to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| This is an advisory stakeholder committee that basically is broadly representative of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| interests in our community, but there will be plenty of public meetings, there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| ad hoc committees with different interest areas, there will be extensive public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| a lot of everything will be posted on our website, there will be all kinds of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| for people to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| I think we need, so we had, did we get a motion and a second on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| So now we actually need an amendment because there were a few names that were added that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| weren't on the original agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| So that is the motion to adopt this as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Do you have the one that was before you on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I know the health person was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Who else was in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Which names were added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Dr. Buchanan and one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| So before you now on the table with the amendment, you've got the 20 individuals being appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=796)|
| 0:13:26| plus the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| So I have, this is on the amended motion or the amended, oh, I'm sorry, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| I had a comment I was going to make and I'll agree with what Councilman Starr said, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| a great group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Would you pull your thing down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| It's a great group of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| There's a great group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| My only comment is I wish we had a few more people from the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| It seems like there's good representation of neighborhoods and schools and entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| that deal with biking and greenways and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| And I know we have at least a realtor and a developer, but I wouldn't mind seeing at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| least one more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Maybe if you have room somewhere, you're going to squeeze them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Well, I will tell you, if you look at number 12, Amy Nolan, who's here tonight, she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| there representing the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| And part of all of these folks, their goal, their charge will be to also make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| people in their network are aware of what's going on and have adequate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Remember, this committee is not voting to then move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| The only votes will be before MPC and then City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| So this is recommendations, but we would expect all of these individuals to reach out to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| networks and make sure that they're represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| So any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| So we are voting on the, this is a resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=888)|

| 0:15:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| So we have passed the amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2016-2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| 9B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Richmond Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| northeast of Buick Street, from R1A District to RP1 District, at a density of up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| dwelling units per acre, Christine Duncan, applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Mayor, I'd like to move that we send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| There is a little bit greater density than this allows that is needed for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| and so I've talked with Ms. Monaco, the Duncans, Mr. Kelly, and everybody's in agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| it needs to go back to MPC for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| It talks about four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| How many do they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Yeah, so it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| It's a rounding error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Well, it's not a big number, but it does make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| It affects the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| It has to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| That'll go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Arthur Seymour, Jr. of the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Appeals' decision to deny variances related to reconstruction of a ground sign in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| C3 District property located at 2932 Alcoa Highway, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Okay, so this is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| So we will hear first from the appellant, represented by Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| Also, we have Bob Munday and Keith Penke, who are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| And then we have one person who's here to speak against it, which is Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| So as you all know, the procedure is each side gets up to three people and up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| You always want to ask me to change that, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| I'm just telling you ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| I think I can hold it, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| So go ahead, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Mayor, members of Council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I am here on behalf of Mr. Bob Munday, the owner of the property at 2932 Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| which is the subject of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| This property, in 1988, went under lease to Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| The property was used by Hardee's under Mr. Munday's lease until this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| It is next to a number of other businesses, none of which are in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| At a date between 1988 and the present, it was annexed into the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| The other properties around it were not annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| We're asking for a variance to re-erect a sign that was removed by TDOT's contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| at the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| In 2008, Mr. Munday can explain this in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| a portion of the property was condemned by the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| That portion contained the sign that is here before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| That sign remained on the property, however, until it was dismantled by the TDOT contractor this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| We're simply seeking to re-erect the same sign, 40 feet high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| on the remains of the property that Mr. Munday owns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| The former Hardee's restaurant will become a Grace's Chicken run by Joe Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| a local citizen who is opening one on Magnolia at the former Wishbones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and intends to open a second location here on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| As I mentioned, all the other signs around the property are outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| and have been re-erected to the same height they had before the state condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| There is some mention in the opposition to this that because it is on a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1200)|
| 0:20:09| that in state law in some way limits the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| It does not limit on-premise signs, and we're trying to make this an on-premise sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| so the scenic highway simply does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| We're looking at the city's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| The property had been condemned, as I mentioned, in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| In 2015, you all enacted a new city sign ordinance, and this sign was removed in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1231)|
| 0:20:44| We're simply asking for a variance to replace an identical sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| The face will not change, the height will not change at the place for Grace's Chicken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| which will be run by Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| I'd like to turn it over now to Mr. Keith Pankey with SignCo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| who can address his dealings on trying to get this sign approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| I will hand out some exhibits while Mr. Pankey is talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Can I ask him a question before he sits down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Certainly. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Arthur, when you get done, I guess, handing that out, I'm going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Then I might get lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I was looking at the ordinance attached to our packet, and one of the sections, let's see where it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| I guess it's 11.6E2 says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| On parcels and lots adjacent to any streets or roads that are part of the state's scenic highway system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| only a monument or column sign shall be allowed, provided the maximum height shall be 6 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| and the maximum sign area shall be 36 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| You say that does not apply to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| No, no. That is your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| What I am saying is state law, the Scenic Highway Act, does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| That's your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| That's our rule here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| In the city of Knoxville, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| But the Scenic Highway Act itself does not prohibit the re-erection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| I appreciate that distinction. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Mr. Pankey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| If you'd please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| My name is Keith Pankey, 419 West Bridge Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| I'm the owner of Sign Co., Incorporated here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| We've been in business since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Mr. Mundy is one of my customers, and he called us the 1st of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| and told us that the state had cut down his sign, and it was laying up by the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| and he wanted us to investigate how we could get it put back up in the same condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| but closer to his building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| So we started the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| We went out and measured the steel and the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| and in order to get a permit through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| it first has to be engineered by a licensed engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| So I phoned the city sign inspector's office, Brandon Littlejohn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| and I spoke to him about what had gone on, explained that the sign was installed legally in 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1415)|
| 0:23:47| and from there it was a legal sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| So Mr. Mundy was not the one that actually cut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| So Brandon Littlejohn told me, he said, based on what you've told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| he said since the owner did not cut the sign down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| he should be allowed to put it back in a different position on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| So from there we ordered engineering so that we could apply for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| We submitted the engineering and the application, even paid for the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| and a few weeks went by, and the 1st of August we found out from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| that the law department said that since the sign was on TDOT's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| it was nonconforming and could not be put back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| So we've spent money after being told we could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Now the city says, no, you cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| So that's where this process has stopped with our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Now Mr. Mundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, I'm the owner of the property there, and of course Hardee's did build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Please give your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Oh, I'm Bob Mundy, 902 Kermit Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I've been a longstanding member of the community here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| and we did lease that property in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| They actually opened in 1988 to Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| It's been a real good food for the area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| A lot of people really like that, like the Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| But with the new improvements, Hardee's decided to move out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| but they didn't decide to do that even though they took the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| The Tennessee Department of Transportation took the property in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| They didn't build the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| So Hardee's wanted to stay on until they built the new road that restricted the left turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| So in 2016, they actually moved out on the last day of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1559)|
| 0:26:10| What we wanted to do is, of course, it's a real nice restaurant, fast food restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| and we just wanted to move the sign back onto the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| The only reason TDOT owned that property was the fact they condemned it for the road purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| you know, to build another lane right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| So we just wanted to move it back approximately 15 or so feet, 20 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| Here again, the sign's been there since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| It's the exact same sign, and I appreciate your consideration to let us move that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Can I ask Mr. Mundy one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| Really, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| If counsel wants to entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Let's hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Counsel says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Let's hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Were you paid for the sign, Mr. Mundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| To the best of my knowledge, I was not paid for that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| It was just an obvious thing that when the highway came through, we wanted to move it back on the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| They took approximately something like 20 front feet depth back into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| So to my knowledge, it was just well known we wanted to move it back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| And it would have been foolish to move it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| From 2008 to 2016, there was no change in the construction of the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| so it would have been foolish to move it back eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| So when they're under construction now, of course we want to move it back now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Okay, now do you want to ask the question now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I need clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| I mean, I just couldn't imagine, whether it be the city, the state, or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| to come in and take property from you and just say, tough beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| I mean, there was no compensation for the sign or the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Well, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| You know, when they condemn property, they value the real estate, and they did pay money for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| And then sometimes if they damage the property, you know, restricted access or anything, they would pay a damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| But for a movable sign, you know, we just wanted to move it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| Well, I'm confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I mean, I know you were paid for the property, but what about the sign itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| They probably gave us moving costs, possibly, to move it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| But, see, that's a portable sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| We can move it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| All right, so now, thank you, Mr. Mundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| We will now hear from the respondent, Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1739)|
| 0:29:07| Mayor O'Hara, members of Council, Gene Burr, 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| I've been there since 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| This commercial area is in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| We've seen that commercial area decline over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| We've lost every supermarket that we ever had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Finally, the state decided to improve the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| They're spending $71 million to improve the highway between Maloney Road and Woodson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| And part of the improvement will be the improvement in signage itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Mr. Seymour's client will have an enhanced setting for his new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| but the fact of the existence of the scenic highway is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| The only time we have an opportunity to upgrade the quality and character of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| and we have signs that exceed the norm is when they're taken either destroyed by natural causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| or taken for some major public improvement, which is the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| We feel that the consistency of signage on the scenic highway is a big part of what the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| and the neighborhood gets back in return for the designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| I'm looking forward to the improvements that come on the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| maybe even becoming a customer to Mr. Seymour's client's chicken business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| as I've eaten there many times over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| But we just want them to adhere to the same standards, principles of the scenic highway as it's designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| And I'm here representing Scenic Knoxville, and I urge you to deny this appeal for the actions that have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| There's clearly no hardship imaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| This is level terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| The signage, the new signage that they placed there, whatever that may be, will be highly visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| much more visible at six feet, in fact, than it would be at 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| I'm open to any questions, but I urge you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Now, Mr. Seymour, you have up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| First, I'd like to enter into the record a part of your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| which is the record from the Board of Zoning Appeals, which has been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| Secondly, Mr. Mundy's sign, I think, is the only one that's being affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| because the remaining parcels in the commercial area, I think, are county properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| and they will be able to re-erect their signs if they happen to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| So, in effect, there's not going to be a general cleansing of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Mr. Mundy is going to be reduced and at a clear disadvantage with other businesses in the area to his detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1949)|
| 0:32:39| So that argument, I think, fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| We would ask you to grant the variance because of a change in circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| which is the condemnation action by the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| and the removal by that body of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Okay, counsel, that concludes the hearing from the appellant and respondent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Frost how the ordinance, the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| addresses condemnation of property by a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| Well, if the property was condemned by a government entity, you're throwing me a curveball here, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2002)|
| 0:33:32| Well, it just came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| The property was condemned by a governmental entity, so the ownership of the property would have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| It became part of the state's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| So as reflected in the record, when you have a sign that is not located on a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2029)|
| 0:34:01| that's advertising something on that piece of property, it's no longer an on-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| It's an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| So that change in ownership of the property, I believe, affected the status of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2048)|
| 0:34:17| Then they're wanting to erect a sign in a new location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| which is on the premises of the former Hardee's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| Well, in the meantime, as everyone's well aware, the sign committee task force did its labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2069)|
| 0:34:39| and the new sign ordinance was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| The new signs need to be erected according to the ordinances passed by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2083)|
| 0:34:54| so I'm of the opinion that whatever those new regulations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| because this is a sign in a new location, that they would have to comply with the ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2099)|
| 0:35:13| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| You know, there's about three issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| One simply is that even if the state Scenic Highway Act doesn't regulate it, we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| and we have a requirement that the height be six feet and the surface area be 36 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| If you take away the scenic highway aspect, just look at this as good old Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| we still have a rule, 11.6.C, that says that the maximum sign heights for primary detached signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| and that's what this is, in commercial and industrial zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| the maximum sign height for primary detached signs shall be based on the classification of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| or road adjacent to the property where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| And then there's a table, and if you all remember, we fought like death over that table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| and how far and how high things had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Well, for property fronting on federally designated highways, the maximum sign height is 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| not 40 feet like you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| So even if you disregard the six foot sort of monument sign type thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| you've got a 20 foot max under our general regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| This is a new sign application because the old sign's gone, and the rules say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| and I don't know the particular section, but we fought over that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| if you stop your business for a certain time or whatever, then you're under the new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| You're no longer grandfathered under some old sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| and so you come with an application based on what the standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Max height, 20 feet, even if it ain't a scenic highway, which would make it lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| The third point I think is telling, and that is we're talking about a Board of Zoning Appeals variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| I don't know what the hardship is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I don't hear any proof that says that a guy with a nice monument sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| clearly visible on a flat lot, can't troll in customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| I mean, look at Chick-fil-A on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| It's got a monument sign, and you can park your car in line waiting to get to the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I mean, they sell chicken too, and they can sell it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| He can also have some kind of signage on the front of his building that identifies what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| So the question really is, he argues that I feel sort of unfairly treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| because the county's laxer than you guys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Well, that's tough nookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| We only regulate what happens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I don't know what we do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| But that's my view, is that he hasn't made out any hardship that's based on the nature of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| or its size or topography that deprives him of reasonable use of his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| and that's the legal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Maybe one of the lawyers can tell us better what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| but that's one of the legal standards for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| He is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| There are standards for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Briefly, variances shall be granted only when special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| or conditions such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| fully described in the findings of the board do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2292)|
| 0:38:21| Variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2301)|
| 0:38:30| Editing my comments, reading this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| and any variance granted under the provisions of this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| So, I mean, if you wanted to be generous, maybe you could say do a 20-footer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| but I don't get a 40-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Get a hacksaw and cut part of the bottom off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Vice Mayor Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| I agree with most of what Councilman Dela Vove has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| but without repeating a lot, I'd like to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Okay. We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Well, you know, I know where this is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| I, too, disagree with the 40-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| I don't think you need a 40-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I was talking to Lawyer Frost on my way back from in town today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and I've driven by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| I live topside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I don't know how many times I've driven by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| and I didn't realize that it was that tall originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| It's going to be hard for people to see a 6-foot sign going 80 miles an hour down Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| but I think that's what. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| I don't think that's the speed limit, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Oh, it's not the speed limit, but that's the reality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Did you hear that, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I hope he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| But, you know, I do think that 20-foot would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| I'm not going to make that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| but I think this is another situation, and this is a little unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| but, you know, they weren't operating before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| It's a vacant business, so I can't see the hardship on this particular business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| but I do think, you know, I pose the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| if they were opened and the state took it from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| and then they wanted to come back, to me that could be a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| I'm not sure exactly how that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| but it just seems like when the state comes in and gets that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| and this isn't the case here, but I just want to pose this question for thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| is if they did want to reopen, as a hardy say, I think it would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| But I know that this is, you know, I could make an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| but I'm not going to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| But I think we need to be cognizant of that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I would just add that I think that pretty girls eating hamburgers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| brings more people into hardys than 40-foot signs, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I see the ads on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| Okay, so now we have a motion to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2508)|

| 0:41:53| The motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2513)|

| 0:43:43| When will this finally be completed and that road open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| I'm Jim Hagerman, engineering director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| It is ready for asphalt, so as soon as the asphalt company gets in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| we can finish it hopefully within the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| I just want to observe for the people that may be in the audience or watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| an increase of a $20,000 contract by $40,000 seems crazy up to $60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| but this is the road project where by the time we issued the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| some sinkhole had devoured half the community or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| and they had to go back in and start over working on this giant sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Do you want to tell us a little bit about the Wesley Road problem, Mr. Hagerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| We had a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I mean, we knew that there was a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| There was basically just a dip in the road, and we realized that there was an underground problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| and we sent this company out to probe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| We had a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| We bid it out, and then while we were in the bidding process, it collapsed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| and I think that just the catastrophic nature of the collapse made it a much bigger hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| than it would have been otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| And so this company, the design company, not the construction company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| but the design company had to redo the design for the much bigger hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| They pretty much had to start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2715)|

| 0:45:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| This is more than the normal annual paving, but part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| I just wanted to point out, is done as a result of KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| funding some additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Maybe Mr. Hagerman could tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| but basically when they start digging up utilities there's a need to repave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and they're paying some piece of this additional mileage, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| If they dig it up before the life expectancy of the existing asphalt is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| they pay to repave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| So that, I mean, if we were going to repave it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| then they can tear it up and they don't have to pay for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| So that encourages them to plan ahead on their work as well as compensating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| us for the work that they had to do on our good road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| But we're going to do a few more miles, five and a half miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| or 5.8 miles as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| We've already voted on that, so we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2825)|

| 0:47:42| providing for the issuance of not to exceed $13,500,000 and no dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2862)|
| 0:47:50| of wastewater system revenue refunding bonds, Series 2017A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2870)|

| 0:47:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Oh, he's at the podium already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I see Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| We're going to have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| And he does such a great job of explaining things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| I just wanted you to tell us, we've got four of these, and you might as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| well just hit them out of the park now, but you've got about $55 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| worth of refunding bonds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| KUP identified around $54 million in bonds that were sold back in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| that could be refinanced at lower interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Basically, the rates on the existing bonds, the 2005 bonds, are about 4.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| percent on average, and we replaced that with about 2.7 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| So a decrease of about 160 basis points, 1.6 percent, that will result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| in estimated savings of about $4.5 million for KUB and its customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| And its customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| That's over the life of the bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| That's over the life of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| So it was about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Two other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| One is that you said you were saving $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| If there is some problem with paying the bonds, these are based on KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| revenues for the individual, whether it's electric service and their bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| or gas and their bonds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| The bonds are secured solely by KUB and our system revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| In other words, the bondholders have absolutely no recourse to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| for repayment in the event that KUB didn't pay, which certainly won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| We'll listen to each of the four bonds, but I thought those were important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| points for us to focus on as we look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I appreciate you finding ways to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| We're happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I do need to make, if counsel doesn't mind, I do need to make just a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| comments in order to make sure we're in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| I do need to make counsel aware, and it was included in your packets, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| KUB did submit a plan of refunding for each of the proposed series of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| refunding bonds to the Office of State and Local Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| They were reviewed by the director, and she issued a report back to KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and also provided the city a copy of that, basically stating everything is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| good order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| But I did want to make sure that you were aware of that, and that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| was included in counsel's packets for tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| I guess in addition, would you point out that you're also paying any accrued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| interest charges, fees for attorneys and accountants and bond sellers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| The amount requested to be issued is a little bit higher than the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| bonds that are being refunded because it does cover issuance costs, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| underwriter's fees, and some interest that would accrue on the bonds to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| redeemed between the sale date and the call date of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Mr. Walker, would you state your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3037)|

| 0:50:43| Okay, any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Do we have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3045)|

| 0:54:25| This looked like a good idea to do this. I'm not sure why we're inspecting only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| building garage C for its particular foundation assessment stuff and not A and B and I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| that there's an option that we can hire them to do that extra work and they have about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| week allocated for inspecting the actual building but but why are we leaving those out. Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| because C has that big hillside behind it that might be pushing water under it. What's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| the difference. Jim you're finance director. What we did as part of this budget is we allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3292)|
| 0:55:02| funding to examining the structures with particular emphasis on C because it seemed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3302)|
| 0:55:11| be the one most in question at this time. But if we think that we will need to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| do the other two then we will pursue that. Okay I just noticed I mean they have they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| time elements and stuff for mobilizing and all that stuff and I'm thinking if they're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| they can shoot whatever magic sonic pictures they take or what I don't know. I can't address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| the question about sonic pictures but but we'll be monitoring to see if we if we expand to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| other two buildings. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor Brown. Mr. York one quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3341)|
| 0:55:50| question. How long do you expect it before it may be in the packet before they'll get back with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| report once they do that? How long is that? I don't think it's going to take that long but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| we'll be obviously looking at things that we see some problems crop up. We hope to to have it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| fairly quickly so if there's something that we need to address we could address it as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| the budget process. Okay thank you. They talk about 10 weeks who knows but that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| All right thank you. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3379)|

| 0:56:52| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11 n is a resolution approving a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3412)|

| 0:57:08| located at zero three one six and three five zero south gay street. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Councilman Delvaux. Yeah uh this is a great sounding project with the parking garage under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| on that lower section below the road the the uh what the commercial space on gay street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| and the residential above it and I realized that from reading the materials that a TIF is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| uh and that we're I guess we're putting in four and a half million dollars through the TIF in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| sense to help make it financially doable. My question is about the 20 years and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| I'm sounding like a broken record about that. I wish it was 15 years and Mr. Hill could make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| work on that but but assuming that that is not the case that we're going to do a up to 20 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| TIF situation I still wonder whether uh the increment taxes that comes back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| might be adjusted somewhere along the path of that 20 years. That's a long time and the time value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| money of that 78,000 dollars worth of city taxes that they pay in the interim is going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| more like 30,000 from from just decline in value towards the end of that tunnel. During that 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| years they'll probably reassess land in downtown Knoxville every four years so maybe four times. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| mean I don't understand why when we have a piece that comes out that sort of compensates Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| for for its debt service and its cost of running its business why we can't have a step up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| amount of dollars that land in our coffers and maybe Jim York has that. Dr. Lyons will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3526)|
| 0:58:55| Okay that is a very good question that especially applied to a pilot uh which is when the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| retains ownership and then the taxes can be adjusted but the way a TIF works I mean this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| is a condominium enterprise the will these units he'll be build condominiums which will then be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| sold and the subsequent buyers will pay that and they will pay what their taxes are so where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| taxes go. So it was that if the property is reappraised if it goes up more tax dollars will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| come in as pretty much as you suggest. Oh it will follow the appraisals as it will follow that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| then that that's why and then the up to the 20 years will take effect and it will just be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| off earlier. It won't produce initially more dollars that stay in the city's coffers but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3574)|
| 0:59:42| the reality is as it generates more taxes it will pay down that TIF debt if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| Well it it will uh the city will be paying off will providing money money toward paying off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| the TIF loan and the TIF loan the higher rate will be paid off sooner and then so the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| will then start collecting taxes sooner so we will benefit from reappraisal as a city. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| that. All right thank you. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the mayor to to enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3613)|

| 1:00:28| Doyle trail lease areas. So moved. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 12-a is an ordinance to amend chapter 4 article 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| division 2 section 4-66a of the Knoxville city code relative to distance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| for on-premise beer permits and church buildings. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3647)|
| 1:00:56| favor say aye. Mayor I'm sorry you have your light on. Go ahead. Yeah uh I know some of you think I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| crazy to bring this back but but this is the issue that we sort of confronted around Thanksgiving or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| early December and uh foolishly I didn't study the procedural rules and I and I was on the losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| side of that attempt to amend and so could not offer an amendment at that time but but now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| have the new statute and here's the essence of this. We want to take care of and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| has said we want to take care of these startup churches that want to go in shopping centers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| you know strip malls and those kind of things and and not face the resistance of landlords who say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| well I'd love to rent it to you because I got empty space but I'm afraid if you come in I can't let a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| beer hall or a restaurant or something come in that will run afoul of the city's beer ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| with the 300 foot distance rule. Well this attempts to bridge that gap so that we don't throw the baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| out with the bath water. We want to help those entities have access without without hindrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| from the from the rule the the beer board rule on 300 foot distance and so the new language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| leaves church buildings in but there's a parenthetical against it that says except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| where such church is located in a shopping center or multiple tenant commercial building in zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| c3 to c6 commercial district. That's the real change and the only change that I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| suggest here this allows us to simply say look this business is not affected by the 300 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3746)|
| 1:02:34| rule because it's in a commercial operation that's part of a you know a mall a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3754)|
| 1:02:42| the strip zone the strip mall whatever but it it still helps those churches that might find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| themselves on a highway like Kingston Pike or whatever where there may be some commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| zones or whatever but but none of those type of structures that lease spaces in a multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| tenant situation. This gives us a chance to leave them the traditional protection that they've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| since the 60s and and that the other four major or three or four major cities in in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| also afford to churches so I think it gives the church's respect without hindering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| startups and I I submit to you that this is a decent compromise and I hope you'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| Oh yes I guess the the language that that was in the one that came out with the agenda we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| still struggling with what's the best way to say that exception and you'll notice that it talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| about just churches in c3 to c6. We've added the language and I'm moving that we amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| the proposal to say that the language I just read that any church building except where such church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| is located in a shopping center or multiple tenant commercial building in zones c3 to c6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| commercial district and the reason and let me support that motion the reason we did that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| we were struggling with what are the right terms that kind of work in our zoning codes and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and so we were we had a draft that came out but this this I believe is a better way of describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| what the exception is and makes it easier to apply so I'm submitting that you should support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| the motion to amend this 12 a to include that second on the amendment second okay we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| we have somebody who's here to speak Mr. Jack Wallace thank you for being here sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170131?start=3869)|
