| 0:01:16| Our hearts and thoughts go out to the folks in western Tennessee, in Memphis, and folks along the river that are experiencing flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| and we know that they have trials in their life, and we hope that you will be with them in that time of woe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| And finally, we ask that you bring wisdom and patience to this body as we hear alternatives and opportunities for roadways in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=91)|
| 0:01:43| and that we are able to act with an open and clear mind for the benefit of the people of this community. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=103)|
| 0:01:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=118)|
| 0:02:09| Susan, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=129)|

| 0:02:19| Councilman Grieve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=141)|

| 0:02:27| Councilman Thomas. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Councilman Woodhull. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| I know we've got another council member on the way, and Councilman Palmer cannot attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| So I'd like to thank all of you for coming and being with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| I'd first like to ask if Michelle Hummel would like to come forward, or someone with a CDIB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| And this workshop was requested by the CDIB, as well as Mr. Scott has asked for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=172)|
| 0:03:02| And while he sets up the presentation, if we could ask Ms. Hummel to come to the microphone and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| and address for us, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Good evening. Michelle Hummel, Central Business Improvement District, by address 402 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| And yes, thank you for holding the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| The CBID Board and Parking and Transportation Committee has reviewed this proposal with thoughts and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=201)|
| 0:03:30| The thought that there are some really good ideas generated from the proposed rerouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| but also there's concerns with it being a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| And, you know, there's TDOT and city engineering brought up a lot of good points that were also concerning from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| So the board itself did not take a resolution or make any kind of suggestions from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=227)|
| 0:03:58| Okay, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I know we've got here with us Mr. Welch with the TPO, Mr. King with the city, Dr. Lyons is with us, Coach Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| We've got a number of folks after we go through this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| Any comments before we get started from the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Judging from the agenda, Mr. Scott is going to present his idea, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| Just his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Well, I think it would be important or at least interesting to me and to this council to hear a little bit of background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| say, for example, from Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| This idea actually came out, or some kind of variation of this idea came about, was suggested in the Crandell Orambula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| So, Bill, could you say something briefly before this presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| While Dr. Lyons comes to the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I'd like to say if there's anyone in the audience that would like to participate in the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| we have a sign-up sheet right over here to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| So if you want to come up and sign up, we'll take a look at that in a minute, see how many speakers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| and then we'll figure out how many minutes we have per speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| And Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Hey, Bill, you know, you and I haven't talked, so I'm kind of springing this on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| If you could explain what Crandell Orambula, what that process actually was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and to what extent it interfaces with today's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| Right, and I'll be very brief on this, and we'll have the presentation and then respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| But it's a bit of background that, like I said, I haven't prepared anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| but I think I can address this, you know, in a way that gets at the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| Back in, I think it was 2002, having to do a lot with the Nine Counties, One Vision program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| and with some other funding, a couple of planners were chosen who came into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| and made a whole series of recommendations, many of which we have followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| Others, you know, in terms of immediacy, some were long-term and some were more speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| One of those, for instance, one of the recommendations was that you connect downtown to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| and make the bridges differently that went over the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Well, it was that suggestion that ultimately led, thanks to an idea that was generated from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| to having the transit center placed on church where it is to help link the downtown to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| and overcome some of the damage that had been done by the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| splitting the community east from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| They also recommended that we have downtown design guidelines, which we've come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| and a number of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| As part of that process, this planning and visioning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| they did have a section that addressed Henley Street and the difficulty in crossing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| especially at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| And they recommended a couple of things as part of their broader vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| One was that a headquarters hotel be built on the site of the state supreme court building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| which later we had a proposal that the economy helped do in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And with that headquarters hotel and the existing convention center and the other hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| that the Henley Street be lowered and that the plaza be built over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| to connect all of those entities into one coherent group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| They also, in their report, made little mention of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| It was not a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| In their list of both catalyst projects and priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| and Mr. Wetzel, I believe, has that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| it received no narrative, virtually no narrative, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| and was not listed as a priority at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| It was mentioned at the, I was at the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| and when it was mentioned it was, of course, an intriguing idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| because Henley Street came up and then went down right in front of the convention center to lower it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| but they also mentioned that it would be exceedingly expensive to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| and that they didn't think there would be anything that would be that practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| but they did put it out there as something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| And that acknowledged the fact that the convention center was split from the rest of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| and Henley Street had to be crossed and that had to make some negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| So that is basically the background on the Crandall Arambula part as part of their broader report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| It wasn't anything that was given underscored or bold-faced as a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| but it was definitely mentioned as a desirable entity in conjunction with the development of a large hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| and the creation of a plaza environment right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| If the council would prefer to withhold questions and comments until the end of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| hopefully we'll get most of those questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| And, Mr. Scott, if you'd give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| and generally we like to keep the presentations to about 15, 20 minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Mr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Can you hear me okay on this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Is this okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| My name is George Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I live on 3045 Gibbs Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| I've been a downtown resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| I was a downtown resident my first few years in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| and lived in Knoxville for about 21 years, 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I read an article in a local magazine newspaper, Metro Pulse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| that described how Henley Street could be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| and it kind of fired my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| And since then I've sort of developed this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| I've talked to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| and I want to thank all of you for your indulgence in letting me present to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and many people in the city government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I've been very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Mr. Scott, you may want to sit down and pull that microphone to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| so people can hear a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| If that works, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| So I put this together, and this has gone through several editions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| and this is the current one, or my latest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Now, the concept is to get Henley Street more functional, more people friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| more local traffic friendly, more pedestrian friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| not necessarily for this specific concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| However, this is the one that makes the most sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| This is the downtown plot, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| These are city maps I use for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| And this very clearly delineates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Here's another version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Clearly delineates Broadway, Henley Street, James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| the interstate, and the river as being the boundaries of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=637)|
| 0:10:50| And this very much limits the growth of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Now, there's one part of this that could change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and that is the Henley Street-Broadway route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| This is a dividing line right now that separates UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| and the Convention Center from the rest of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| where so many good things are happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| And also South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| I've presented to several groups in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| and a common theme is that South Knoxville has not been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| has not had the sunshine on it that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| And I think that this would also help develop the northern part of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and the South Knoxville development project, the waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| The idea is that this could be brought into the good downtown urban development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| that's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| This is Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| It creates a barrier between these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Before the closure, and I took these numbers from TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| these are a high average of four years, three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| about 40,000 vehicles a day traveled Henley Street to cross the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and most of it continued south of Moody on Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| The idea is this is the original route, this is Highway 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| There is now a detour route that is faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and this is a Hall of Fame drive to the James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| South Knoxville Bridge, to Moody, to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| And the idea was to ask TDOT to redesignate the existing detour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| into permanent 441 and make the existing 441 business 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| By reducing the speed limit and redirecting through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| that's just trying to push through town as fast as it can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| it will make local traffic and pedestrian traffic easier to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| easier to access points downtown and on each side of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| I went to Boston and I saw Commonwealth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| and that looks like something that could work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Chapman Highway is not as wide as Commonwealth with its sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| but the idea, I think, could still work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| This used to be the main access to Cambridge, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| and now there's a bypass, and they've turned it into a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| and urban retail area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| And these are the traffic counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| 50,000 vehicles basically are at Chapman, Western, Summit, Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| 40,000 of them carry on across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Most of those, by the way, are off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| And 34,000 continue south of Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| So these are just raw numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| You know, we could break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| It may not be quite most, but it looks like a big, significant number of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| do continue right on south of Moody onto Seymour and Point South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| It's actually faster to go on the James White Parkway detour route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| Local traffic would benefit because there wouldn't be all this congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| caused by the through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| and the through traffic would benefit because it's much faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| There's only two stoplights versus nine from the old route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| if you get off the interstate and head south on Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Moody's a city road, but it's wide, it's fairly new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| and it may well be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| I've been told by some people that it may well be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| to become a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| And these are the advantages to local traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| And this is pretty much the same presentation that's on YouTube,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| so you could look that up if you wanted to see it for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| This is a zoning map, and this is the new Urban Wilderness Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| by Legacy Parks Foundation that they're putting together down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| And this is going to make something that no other city that I know of has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Downtown can now develop across the Henley Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| and along the South Knoxville waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| And Legacy Parks, if they make this Urban Wilderness Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| it will be a permanent green southern boundary for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| It'll be like our Central Park, only it'll be bigger than Central Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| and it'll be on the edge, and it's never been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| And it's a way to finally develop the Chapman Highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| This study, I believe, was from 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| And this was proposed as if they were not to finish the James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| they were going to do this instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Well, I think this would be a good opportunity for us to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and make this more of a boulevard, more of a pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| and local traffic-friendly boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| And this is a detail from the same study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| And this is not a new idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| South Knoxville would now become the new southern part of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| This is from the South Knoxville waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| The advantage is that through traffic, of course, it's just faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| It's less congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| You have two communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| One of them is trying to get through town as fast as it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| The other one is trying to access local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| And because of that, they can't do it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Local businesses don't develop very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| GPS-directed traffic would be sent on the detour route now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| instead of sent right through the middle of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| And this is a count of the signalized intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| Only two if you get off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Now, immediately, I see the cost as being relatively low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| There would be some studies, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| But immediately, it would be restriping the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| if that was appropriate for a traffic diet, if that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| Maybe bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Eventually, as the city saw it was important, efficient, feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| then they could put in the medians and the wider sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| Convention center visitors are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| It's pretty intimidating right now to look out at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| six- to eight-lane highway right in front of the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| If you know where the Skyway is, you can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| But if you don't, you know, some people probably just turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| and go have a cup of coffee inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Urban and retail restaurants, I believe, like they are on Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| can now start to develop along Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| There are empty buildings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| There are some state parking lots and what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| there may be for sale soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And just underused urban properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| And some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Through traffic will be driven into residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I think that's happening to some degree right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| I mean, it certainly is on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| But I think once the bridge reopens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| I don't really see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I think local traffic will continue to do like they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| before the bridge was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| If there are issues, then traffic calming measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| like on South Woodlawn, I can see that may be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| If it is, there's some major issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| If it is, there's some things that can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| that I believe they can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| But I want to state that I'm not a traffic engineer, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| This looks like some common sense things that could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and the experts would have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Retail businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Most of the businesses on North Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| there's about a mile and a third there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| are not drive-through, pass-through businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| There's a big bakery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| There's a funeral home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| There's laundry, doctor's offices, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Now, there are some fast food restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| that do depend on some through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| What we'd have to do is decide as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| whether this is going to be a net plus or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| And, of course, I really think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| And if so, then we have to balance out what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| or if we should do something for the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| that would be affected negatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Some would be affected positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Now, Moody would achieve more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| As I understand it, many of the properties there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| are fairly moderate homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Some of them are rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| And if this were to become a federal highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| I would think that those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| could be rezoned commercial and could go way up in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| On the other hand, the neighborhood would be disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| Like it's being disrupted these two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And government engineers haven't studied this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And that's basically what I want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| is I'd like to see people...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Right now, we have this window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| While the bridge is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| we can actually take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| and see what will work best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And if it's the best thing is to leave it like it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| and put more cars on Henley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| well, we should admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And if it's not, then let's think of something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| while we have this chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| This is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| The CBID requested this meeting, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| This is from a previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| I don't own any property on any of this area that's affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| I'm just a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| I see something that can be done for the good of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| It seems like it can be done very low cost right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| relative to some of the other plans I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And we're going to have two years to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Well, now it's probably closer to a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| But at least we're talking about it in public now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And that's really my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| It's for us to throw all the ideas that are possible out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| And this one just seems to make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| This is an opportunity that's going to be unrepeatable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| in our lifetimes to redesign this part of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| to make it a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| An interconnectivity between UT and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| An interconnectivity between UT, downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| the Convention Center, and South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| And that's what I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Okay, just to remind anyone that came in late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| we do have a sign-up sheet for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| So we'll move now into the council discussion aspect on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Thank you, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Mr. Scott, I appreciate all the hard work that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| I know you've been real active trying to push this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| What are your assumptions based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| My assumptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Well, it's pretty obvious that there's no pedestrian traffic on Henley Street at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And walking from, yes, virtually none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| I mean, have you been down there lately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Hey, I'm there about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| You walk down Henley Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I mean, I see lots of foot traffic down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| How much commercial property is available there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| How much commercial property is available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| I have done a count, but it's been months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| There's an underused law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| There's several state-owned property laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| But you say underused law offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Is there somebody occupying it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| They occupy part of it and use most of it for storage from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| What would happen with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I want to tell you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| I've looked at this as well as I can without devoting a full-time job to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| and I don't have all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| And some things look very obvious to me, and if I'm wrong, then that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| But I think that now is the chance for all of us to look at what is possible down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| and what could be in the best interests of the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| And, of course, this is, you know, obviously a state road, which we have absolutely no say-so over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| I mean, this, you know, they would have to be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| You know, I really don't know why we're doing this because it's not our road to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And, you know, I spoke with the Federal Highway Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| They have no interest whatsoever in any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| And, Mr. King, let me ask you if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Say, for example, the city of Knoxville asked for these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| We want to take over these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| What would happen with the bridge restoration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, could we have been faced with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Well, I think Mr. Scott's proposal is to ask TDOT to call that section of Henry Street 441 business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1411)|
| 0:23:42| In conversations with TDOT, they, I guess they haven't totally ruled that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| but they don't seem very supportive of that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| The other way to look at it would be that if the current detour route is called 441,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| then the city would be, and existing 441 is decommissioned as a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| then the city would be responsible for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| probably from the Broadway-James White Parkway across the bridge to Moody Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| which seems to be the suggestion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| And that would mean that that would become a city street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| and the city would be responsible for the paving maintenance and for the bridge itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| And there's also another bridge in that area, the Broadway viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Right, so we would have exposure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Would the state then take over exposure of the South Knoxville Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| You want me to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| The South Knoxville Bridge, the James White Parkway Bridge, they already have that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| That's already, James White Parkway is already a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| You know, this involves the first in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| and, I mean, I'm not going to speak obviously for Mayor Brown in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| but, you know, we met and talked, and I explained to you that I just wasn't supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| And the reason that I'm not supportive of it is that, you know, there's really no basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| I understand it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| But for people to say that it wouldn't cost a lot of money is unfounded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| because it would cost a tremendous amount of money to eventually get a plan of this magnitude to where it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| And I've got, you know, a little over two and a half years in the seat that I'm in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| and the money that I want to be, you know, fighting for is going to go towards the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| I think that's the future of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| It brands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| It gives it eventually the opportunity for retail, new retail to, you know, to invest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1564)|
| 0:26:13| It increased property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| It would attract people to South Knoxville, both to spend money and to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| but most importantly, hopefully it will keep people that are already in South Knoxville in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| And that's, I mean, there's just so much energy to go around, Mr. Scott, and I hope you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| I mean, you said yourself you haven't been able to put all your time into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So, I mean, you've got to prioritize and figure out where it is that you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| I mean, there's a Chapman Corridor plan in place that was put in place by professional planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| and also people who lived in South Knoxville and had a tremendous amount of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| And I think that that is the guiding light for us to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| And that's exactly what I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| But one of the two really other big obstacles for me is, number one, the businesses that would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1618)|
| 0:27:09| Now, when you and I met, you said there's always collateral damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| And I can't afford to have collateral damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| You know, me and a lot of people for the last several months have worked as hard as we can to convince the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1638)|
| 0:27:28| that are being affected by this bridge closure up to Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| You know, we've websites, door-to-door visits, assurances, doing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| There's not one day that goes by that I don't think about how can I help those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| and the people who live in South Knoxville, because this is a huge project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| And I'm not willing to risk the folks at Shawnee's, at Ruby Tuesday's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| You say fast food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| What about Disick's Chain, Allen's Sign, Berry Funeral Home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, I'm not willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Those people have been in South Knoxville for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Shawnee's, for example, probably on a given day there would employ, they told me, 50 to 60 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| And in this economic times, I mean, I'm not willing to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| risk the investment that they've made for years and years in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| nor the jobs that could be lost because of collateral damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| So, you know, it's really acting in reverse of what I've been trying and a lot of people in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| and a lot of people that live in South Knoxville have been trying to do ever since this bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| Now, I've got people calling me going, what in the world is this all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| You've been telling me that, you know, everything's going to be okay and this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| and now I've got to explain to them that we're going to have a workshop that, you know, can make this permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| And, you know, I just hope you understand that I'm not supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| And then, secondly, in equal importance, is the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| And I think you made the collateral damage statement about the folks that live on Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| And you say the rentals, you know, moderate homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| But I want to tell you what, those are castles to the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| And over my dead body, well, I'll let that turn commercial until they're ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Because not only does it affect the people on Moody, it affects the people right in behind Moody, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| And it keeps going and it keeps going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| And I'm not willing to sacrifice people who have lived there for 40 and 50 and 60 years for a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1768)|
| 0:29:39| And that's, in essence, what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| And that's, you know, that's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| I don't think there's any doubt about how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| But, again, I'm not willing to risk the neighborhood intrusion nor the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| that exists in South Knoxville today and I hope for years and years and years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Now, that's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Councilman Del Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Well, I see that Mr. Pavlis was shy in expressing his views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| I appreciate you pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| George, you know, I certainly commend you for energy in trying to take this idea to the street and presenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| And I know you started a good year, year and a half ago, taking it around and showing it to folks and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| From my perspective, I guess my concern falls maybe twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| One is it seems like during the last seven to eight years we have spent, we, not Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1832)|
| 0:30:42| but the state and Knoxville and the county and everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| spent a lot of money connecting Henley Street to the interstate with tunnels and good exits on the interstate to get people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1845)|
| 0:30:55| And I don't know how many tens of millions of dollars we've spent there and on the South Knoxville Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| And this is the major north-south corridor, as far as I can tell, that runs our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1861)|
| 0:31:11| and takes it all the way from Halls and Kentucky south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| I mean, and I realize in essence you're saying we can have two 441s, the business downtown exit and the thruway traffic exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1875)|
| 0:31:26| And maybe there's some appeal to that, but I looked at those, briefly at those pictures of the Boston Commonwealth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| and it's obvious that that area is surrounded by brownstones with businesses on first floors and residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| and lots of activity to do there as well as to sit and cross and play in the commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| And I've been through the commons, not recently, but probably five or six years ago, and it's a lovely area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1906)|
| 0:31:54| But what we have on Henley Street is more, we've got a few restaurants, the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| businesses that really aren't open to public trade, and I don't see the foot traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Maybe it would be nice to have a place to walk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| And certainly Knoxville has been kind of built as a pioneer town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| It's not laid out with some big, broad boulevards and streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| And I can see you're focusing on the opportunity for having some of that activity maybe focused there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1940)|
| 0:32:29| but it seems like the second aspect of how much money are we willing to put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| when this road has an important transportation function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| when the physical activity in the downtown is not really along Henley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| it's on the other side towards Gay Street and the streets that connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| And I think you're right, the timing to take a second look, it certainly is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| it's a healthy time to look when you have this opportunity to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| but it seems like spending quite a bit of money to abandon something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| We've spent the last seven, eight, ten years getting right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| And I just, it's certainly an about face in terms of where the plan was going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| that when you walk down that road, I think that's probably got the widest sidewalks in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| I don't know that there's another area in downtown Knoxville or maybe anywhere in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| that's got sidewalks that wide, and so you can walk the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I will agree with you, it's a little intimidating to be a slow old fat man trying to cross a busy road like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| because you've got four lanes on one side at least, and at least three, maybe four on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| But, you know, we have crosswalks, we have places that we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| and we do have the flyover if you want to take the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And you're right, I certainly think that finding a way to make that more people friendly is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| Maybe we ought to be considering running a trolley back and forth for the conventioneers to get to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| We probably already do that somewhat, but maybe there's another way to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| But I guess I have trouble seeing us give up our major north-south driving boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| with good ties to the interstate and to the businesses south of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| And hopefully one day soon we're going to hear that something good is going to happen with that hospital there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and all the access we can have to that is greatly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| So I have trouble pushing this up to the front of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| And then when I hear what Nick says, that we've got businesses that have 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| 30-year commitment to Knoxville risking losing two-thirds of the traffic that go by their front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| I don't know how we answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| So I think it's good to think about it, to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| but I guess I don't see a strong impetus to go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| But I'm willing to hear what everyone else has to say because you did take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and effort to get us focused on this, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Could I respond to a couple of points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Up to the chairman, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Would the council like to have a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Mr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| One of them is a UT engineering class did a study of this, much more involved than what I was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| and studied the businesses that are on that mile and a third stretch of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| And overwhelmingly, most of them are not reliant on drive-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| They are reliant on local traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Now, there are some that are reliant on drive-through traffic, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| This is an opportunity we can't, we'll never have again in our lifetimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| and I'm not saying we should do what I'm proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| What I'm saying is we should talk about it in an open and friendly way and really see what's best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| What's best for downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Downtown is the face of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| When downtown looks good, the city looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| So it doesn't just affect people in Knicks and Mayor Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| It affects everybody in the whole metro area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| And I guess that's all I've got to say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I'd like to call on former Councilman Joe Holquist because, yes, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| Let me ask you, Councilman Roddy, you know, I've tried to say this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| that I think we ought to hear the whole, you know, public forum aspect of it, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| some of which have signed up here to kind of gather all the information in and then have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| On the agenda today, we have the council discussion now, and then we have public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| We can change the agenda, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| My question was about the Chapman Highway Corridor Study that you and I served on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| And then, you know, roll into some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Councilman Holquist, or former Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Vice Mayor Bailey and I served with you several years ago on the Chapman Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| And I know it was considered a little bit groundbreaking at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| because TDOT was willing to engage a community process for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| in looking at long-range planning for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I think we have to make a distinction about who did what and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| TDOT was not heavily engaged in the Chapman Highway Corridor process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| I'm not saying that TDOT wasn't involved, but that process was managed by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| and TDOT certainly was part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| But later, TDOT came in separately from that and had a consultant out of Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| I don't remember the name of the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| And they looked at the potential for making certain improvements along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| They put up the big aerial photo, gave people sticky dots to indicate where they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| you know, to see the priorities in terms of, you know, investment, state dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| you know, or federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| So those were two separate things that didn't happen simultaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| and they weren't that coordinated from the way I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| So I'm not sure if that answers your question or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| but the Chapman Highway Corridor process started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and I don't want to belabor this, Vice Mayor, because you've got other things to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| and other people want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| But I put in a request to MPC to start a corridor planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| and then almost at the same time, right after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| then-County Commissioner Clark sent a letter requesting that MPC look at Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| and the whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| And it ended up, because of the city politics and the mayor then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| it ended up being a county-driven process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| The official request came from the county mayor, Mayor Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| at the request of Commissioner Clark and Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| But we did move forward, and you know the rest in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| It wasn't an official task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| It was more like a study group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| But that's as much semantics as anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Mike, I know Mr. Scott referenced that the outcome of that was a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| to make some improvements at Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| but I also thought that there was, that the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| we looked at a number of different continuations of the South Knoxville Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| as it continues into South Knoxville and where it might terminate eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| That's a different task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| That's the James White Parkway task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| That's the one I wanted to ask about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Sorry, wrong nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Then wasn't the conclusion that that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| or that the South Knoxville Bridge should eventually terminate at John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2385)|
| 0:39:55| I don't know if I would say there was a conclusion about where it should terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| The recommendation of the task force was that TDOT should proceed with planning on that highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| that corridor, but look at alternatives, including the type of highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| the design speeds, more of an urban parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| There are a variety of things in those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Most of those made it into the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| There's one that I quibble about whether or not it really made it into the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| But all that said, it was looking primarily at terminating at Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| beyond Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| In other words, intersecting with Governor John Sevier Highway with an interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| but going beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| All the maps, the drawings, everything that was looked at by the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| that was really kind of where it more or less landed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| I guess my point in engaging in this dialogue is I applaud Mr. Scott for bringing this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| and his point being that we need to look globally at the whole issue of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| and connectivity between downtown and points south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Right now we have a bit of a bridge to nowhere in that it crosses the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| and has a very wide corridor, but then terminates short of taking the traffic into connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| For example, if you're an island home and you want to get to the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| if that road were continued down to John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| you could take John Sevier across to Alcoa Highway and there you'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| and you'd have a lot more connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Some of what we talked about in that study was that if you take that through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| which Mr. Scott pointed out, I think his number was 34,000 out of 50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| of the folks coming across the Henley Street Bridge are going to points beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| in a global sphere of transportation connectivity is focusing on lobbying for the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| to continue the South Knoxville Bridge corridor and that roadway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| all the way down to John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Does that accomplish more of our goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Because it does take that through traffic to points beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| and then also simultaneously alleviates congestion on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| which I think would be supportive of the small businesses that Councilman Pavlis is advocating for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| So I don't know where the rest of the Council stands on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| but I think in terms of a global look at our transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| the time that I spent in that study, we saw a lot of projected positive outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| in investing energy lobbying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Yes, sir. Mr. Scott, I just wanted to be clear on your proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| especially on Henley across from the UT Conference Center and the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| You're proposing narrowing the street and widening the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Is that basically your proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| My basic proposal, I guess, is that we should talk about it and study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| I could see it happening where two lanes in each direction would be sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| but I would like an expert to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I'm wondering, I don't know, at the UT Conference Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| in your discussions and talking to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| have you talked with UT about their long-range plans with that conference center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| No, I have not. I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| I presented it to several people at UT, but nobody that would be effective in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| I'd like to also recognize in the audience Dr. Chris Cherry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| who's the head of the UT Transportation Department, is with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and Mark Donaldson with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So we've got a wealth of knowledge out there amongst us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Councilman Del Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| I wonder if we can bring some of that knowledge forward to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| You'd like to now, or we do have some speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| Right, because this is a chance to look at this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| and I think the thing that George did do was say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| hey, let's stop and take a second look at the opportunities, the advantages, disadvantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| and if we've got someone here from the State Highway Department or UT Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| or MPC that has some aspect of this they could tell us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| I'd be interested in hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| I don't know about my brothers and sisters on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Well, I'll say this, that as a council member, at-large council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| I appreciate Councilman Pavlis' passionate position to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| and to represent his constituency in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| And my view all along is that the council needs to be responsive to citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| and to ideas and to plans and that we should always try to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| and to see if there are, in this case, any parts of this proposal or idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2689)|
| 0:45:00| that might not have an adverse part to it towards the residents on Moody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2700)|
| 0:45:09| the small businesses on Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| Maybe there's some merits to this that we should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| And so I think that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| So a workshop is to hear from all interested parties, the public, and so that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| So I appreciate, Mr. Scott, you going to this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and I think there are a lot of good ideas within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| On the other hand, we have a part of our city that maybe there would be some negative aspects to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| So as we move along, I just wanted to add my comments here during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| Mr. Welch is at the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| If you'd like to give us your name and address and proceed, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Jeff Welch with the Knoxville Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| i.e., the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Briefly, I've handed out to you a memo that we took a very preliminary look at this several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| in response to George's presentation to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and the opportunity that he was going to present to CBID late last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| There are, you know, this is an opportunity to state it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| but we have some serious issues centered behind this proposal that he's presenting to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| First of all is the safety issue that could potentially occur as a result of reducing the number of lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2794)|
| 0:46:43| from three through lanes to two lanes, particularly southbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| Our major point is that you have a significant amount of traffic coming out from Western Avenue, Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| and off of the interstate, and you immediately then have turning movements onto downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| versus off of Clinch and onto Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| Those, as you see now in the handout that is on the last page of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| the estimated queue lengths from our analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| this is assuming that there's not a significant amount of diversion off of Henley Street as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| But right now we have queue lengths that are backing off from Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| As many of you come off of the interstate or Western Avenue, there's a lot of weaving going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| and if you reduce the through lane traffic, our analysis based on what is out there today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| is that the queue length is going to be significantly backed up past and through Clinch Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| and quite a bit of a distance up and almost close to Western Avenue and Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| There right now because of that, you basically reduce the number of lanes there that are going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| and therefore the queue length is going to be extending further to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| The premise that from our analysis, I mean as a result of that you're going to have opportunities for a lot more safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| a lot more rear end crashes coming off of Western Avenue off of Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| Our analysis from our traffic demand model that we use to analyze traffic issues in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| indicate about less than 10% of the traffic on Henley Street is destined to south into Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| Over 60% of the traffic is there south of Moody, north of Moody and in the Henley Street area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| is where the traffic is generating to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| As you go further to the south, there's less and less traffic that is from Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| that is coming from south of Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| It's going down further and further as you're going south as depicted on the first map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| Secondly, the issue of the travel time and the distance that people are going to be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| You're talking about on a regular basis folks wanting to go, having to take if they're choosing to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| as their travel distance is going to be twice as far as it would be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| People just are not making those types of choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| They'll see their patterns are there and they're going to continue to most likely go down Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| and their destinations are UT and downtown and they're coming from south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| not coming from way out into Sevier County and they're very familiar with the street system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| They'll probably continue to use Henley Street and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Councilman Roddy, in response to the Chapman Highway-John Sevier Corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| the recommendation was that it should continue to be built at John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Jamesway Parkway is built. It should connect to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| At that point in time, we should come back to Chapman Highway and look at ways to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| and the concepts that George brought up there, and look at ways to make Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| that south portion of it, a much better and more street-friendly and pedestrian-friendly corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| It was felt that that is at the time that needs to be done, that we need to pursue Jamesway Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| in order to handle the future traffic growth in this entire regional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And that is the opportunity that we would have to explore the, i.e.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| improving pedestrianized or street-friendly Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| Those are basically our precursory comments that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| We've done not, you know, a full-scale traffic engineering analysis of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| and, you know, you'd invest several thousands and thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| in order to really take a good, hard look at that from our perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| Questions or comments for Mr. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| I have one. Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Yeah, I was just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Your last comment was that if you were going to do something different to Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| you'd basically have to have the James White to John Sevier through-route sort of completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| In other words, in order to take a second look at that, that's the right time to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| That, from our perspective, yes, it is, because that is where you have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| An alternative that goes all the way down, then, if they're really through traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Right. And as South Knoxville grows and South County grows, that is the time, you know, as that is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| If a decision is made to complete that, that is the opportunity that you come back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| and look at significant, you know, improvements to, i.e., or, you know, street-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| or make more of a complete street-type corridor for Chapman Highway, and I think even Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| The folks, you know, Henley Street is serving as a major access point to downtown and the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| and it will continue to do that, irrespective if you have one lane or five lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| and the traffic is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Is there any other north-south route that's as direct as that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| I mean, we've got a picture coming down through those, you know, mountains at Sharps Ridge or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| and it seems like Broadway is there for a reason that it kind of turns into Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| because that was a physically possible way to get north-south traffic, and I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I guess because we have the ridges and valleys, we are very limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| in what our north-south corridors are available to us, so Alcoa Highway is an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| but, again, you're increasing the travel distance, same as you would on for James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| So I think our options are very limited because of the bridge and because of our valleys, our hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| How much are we spending on the bridge to repair it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Steve, I guess it's $25 million for Henley Street Bridge right now, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| So we're investing in a bridge that is designed to carry a lot of traffic, not a little bit of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| I mean, it's going to have a pedestrian and bikeway and whatnot, but it's meant to move traffic, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| That's the major design of that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| I mean, it's a major connector across the connecting south and north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| and it's a federal highway as well as two state highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| In the packet that we were given by Mr. Welch, there's a figure three that shows the designation gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| and we haven't talked about this, but I experienced this one evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| If you're trying to get from Seymour to Maynardville and you're trying to use 441,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| and I was trying to do essentially that one night, and I came across the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| and it put me right on the James White Parkway, and the next thing I knew I was at Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| And I thought, well, heck, this is not Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| I'm going to flip around at Cherry Street and come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Essentially, if you want to do that now on this detour, you have to exit James White Parkway at Hill Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| and go between where our fire department offices are in the back of the safety building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| up Hill Avenue to Summit Hill, and then get on the Hall of Fame drive to get over to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| It was the most surreal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| I'd never realized it worked this way, but you see the Broadway exit off the Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| but you're on James White Parkway and you drive right by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| You're thinking, I want to go there, and next thing you know you're at Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| So there's definitely, I mean, I guess it could be overcome again by putting traffic on Hill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| which essentially is a local street, but there's a connectivity missing link there that's pretty critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| Yes, and I think City and Public Works Director Steve King mentioned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| and there would be some serious hurdles to jump over that with TDOT and the Federal Highway Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3270)|
| 0:54:38| Okay, thank you, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| We'll move on to our speakers who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| If I pronounce your name incorrectly, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| The first speaker is Anne Lalonde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3287)|
| 0:54:57| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| It's Annie Lalonde, 4080 Brooksville Road in Lenoir City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| I am representing Shoney's Restaurants here, corporate office, main office on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| Shoney's, I had the opportunity to look at the YouTube video that Mr. Scott has posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| and reviewed it with our executive team and wanted to comment on some of the issues that were brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| First of all, I'd like to give you some background about Shoney's of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| We are not a chain restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| We are a locally owned and operated ESOP company here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| We were established in 1962, which will be 49 years this July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| The fourth restaurant we opened was on Chapman Highway, has been there for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| ESOP, for those of you who don't know, means that the employees own the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| We have a president and CEO who oversees the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| but our employees are the owners of this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| We have 21 restaurants in 10 East Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| We employ approximately 1,100 people in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| and over 400 of those employees work within the Knoxville city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| more than 50 of them specifically at our Chapman Highway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| As most of you know, the restaurant industry has experienced some difficult sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| over the past three years due to the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| We have not been left behind on that, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| We have experienced that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| We also had significant loss of sales specifically at our Chapman Highway location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| due to the closing of the Baptist Hospital, which has been very painful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| We used to have quite a few business people, the people visiting patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| but specifically the medical staff would come to our Shoney's restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| because we offered a helpful option with our salad bar, quick, easy access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| quick drive across just down the street, quick, easy access to downtown if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| and unfortunately that's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Having said all that, we wholeheartedly support the improvement of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| We know that that Henley Street Bridge has needed to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| and we have planned, knowing that this construction was due for the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| on how we are going to deal with the loss of business once the Henley Street Bridge was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| We are considered a gathering place for the South Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| and the Seymour community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| We have many organizations who meet at our restaurant on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| We have some customers who eat every day with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| We have meetings weekly and monthly for the community of the South Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| and we are trying to reward our regular customers in the South Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| by offering them a frequent diner card so that when they come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| we can reward them for their frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| We also are recognized by the Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| as a Go Green East Tennessee business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| We are supporting improving the environment and improving our areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| and want to recognize that and have you know that we support improving our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| However, we cannot support permanently changing the Tennessee State Highway to 441| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| to be detoured around the newly completed Henley Street Bridge once it is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| You may find it surprising that we have regular customers who visit us from the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| that are tourists and they like to take the Chapman Highway Connector to the mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| to the tourist areas south of us and they actually consider that a scenic route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| and prefer to stop at our restaurant on their way through to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| We also have very loyal Seymour area customers who make an effort to come to Shoney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| and once they are now using the Moody Avenue detour, they have established a new habit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| which when it comes time for that bridge to open, it will take us six to ten times more dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| to invest in our marketing and our effort and money to bring those customers back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| because now we'll have to ask them to reestablish a new habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| It seems to me and this has been brought up and I just want to reiterate that there aren't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| a whole lot of opportunities to develop a walking boulevard because there isn't a whole lot of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| available for new businesses on the specific area of Henley Street that has been targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| We ask that you please do not penalize even more the businesses who are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| to keep their doors open during the necessary process of maintaining the Henley Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| by changing Tennessee State Highway 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| If City Council approves this, you'll be forcing each of these businesses to look at how we could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| continue our business, employ our staff, pay our taxes and support the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| Please, Shoney's of Knoxville Incorporated respectfully asks you to deny any further process in this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Mr. Tom Cochran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| Mr. Cochran, nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| If you'd state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| It's 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I'm probably not going to need that, but my name is Tom Cochran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I'm 10209 South River Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And on Chapman, we've been there for 51 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| So we may be one of the longer ones there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We actually have three stores on that, on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| two of which that's been heavily impacted with the bridge closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| Now, we're excited about the bridge being redone because that's a very important part of our lifeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Along Chapman Highway, the traffic that comes is very important to the restaurant industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| We're glad to see that when we did the tunnel that it took millions of dollars of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| It opened up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| It made the traffic a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| It's something that's helped the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| When I come down to Knoxville, down to the city, I always come through the tunnel and up Henley and turn right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| And that's part of how the access to the city is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| If we restrict our access more and reduce the number of lanes and the turns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| then you're going to see less people coming downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| You also would see less people going across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Now, coming across the bridge is very important to the businesses that are on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| It's part of what makes the viability of that side of the highway very good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| It's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| We've enjoyed a lot of years over there, had a lot of fun being part of the city over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| It's our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| And I talked to my sister and I talked to six different businesses up the highway there in the last two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3756)|
| 1:02:46| because I found out about this two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| All six feel strongly that they do not want to see the change of designation on the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3768)|
| 1:02:58| and restriction of flow across Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| We're looking forward to when the bridge opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Right now we're feeling the pain, but we're looking forward to that bright day when it opens back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| I want to thank everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| I do think there's some ideals that are out there in Mr. Scott's plan that has some credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| But I think changing that highway from being the corridor downtown harms the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| It harms the access to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| It harms the access for the businesses on Chapman and future plans for whatever we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| If we could get someone in the hospital territory, that would be wonderful for that side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| We need that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| We need the flow of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| We need that to stay the way it is and continue to build off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| John Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| If you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| It's 604 and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Yeah, John Johnson, 406 Level Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| I represent Arby's restaurants in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| We're kind of a new kid on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| We've only been on Chapman Highway for 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| So I commend you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Back in the 60s, that was our second store that we opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| We now have 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Before the bridge closed, Chapman Highway was in our top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| It's now in our bottom three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I remember when my dad opened that store in 1969, maybe 70, the bridge closed sometime around then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3885)|
| 1:04:53| I was only like 12 or 13 at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and I knew the concern he had about the bridge being closed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| I don't know how long it was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| It was closed enough to scare him to death, and we're beginning to feel that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| We're double-digit, 20, 22 percent down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| We employ 30, 35 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| We don't employ a whole lot of people, but we employ great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| We're committed to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| We were even debating about knocking off the hill next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| scraping that building and putting a large restaurant similar to the one we have in our Dandridge store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| So we had a lot of great plans for it, but if this plan goes forward, we're not really sure how we would survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| So that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| And then as far as downtown goes, we recently closed our Gay Street location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| and we're looking to developing it into retail and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| It will probably be done in the next year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| And when I look at Gay Street, and then I also look at an extended part of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| and a road or two over, there is so much development that still can happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| I can't imagine that Henley Street would be a viable place for at least a couple decades if this proposal went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| So all that to say, we're glad the bridge is going to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| We hope it gets fixed yesterday so that we can open up and get back to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| But I guess I'm kind of in line with all the other restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| We absolutely love where we are, and we hope that we can stay there for a lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Mr. Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Yeah, before you leave, sir, Mr. Johnson, do you have some sense of customer counts about how many are just kind of local repeat folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3988)|
| 1:06:38| as opposed to people who are traveling down a U.S. highway and say, hey, there's a place to eat, a Ruby Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| I've heard of them, let me give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Well, I probably don't have precise numbers, but I do know that when UT shuts down, we're down 10, 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| During the summer, our traffic picks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| But I think in the study, it was also mentioned that a huge majority of people kind of have a destination that's beyond where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| But they still eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| They still stop by and eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| And so, you know, I don't know the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I know we're 20, 22 percent down, and that takes about a couple of restaurants to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Their profitability takes care of the negative impact at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So we're down three stores right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| We're basically neutral on three stores for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| But if 34,000 less cars came by, you'd surely have less people hunting for your restaurant, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| We probably would open it up to, I don't know what we'd do to it, but it wouldn't be an Arby's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| It wouldn't be an Arby's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Again, if you'd give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| It's 6-0-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I'm Sylvia Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| I live at 412 East Moody Avenue, the road that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| And I've lived in South Knoxville for 69 years since we were competing with times here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| And I've lived in this house for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| We do appreciate the fact that the city widened our road and put sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| It was a terrible road before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| But we never thought that it would be designated a major highway because it is all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| It's residential on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| And ever since the street's been there, nothing has gone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| It's all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| And the street's before us, on the back of us and across the street, all of that is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| And we would like to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4116)|
| 1:08:47| The James White Extension that you were talking about, Ms. Roddy, we did study that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| And we did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| And it was supposed to come out at Dishman's Curve there on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| And this committee that we all met with for several months and lots of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| decided that we really needed it to go on to James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| And then it could be a major highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| It needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| But it needed to be in a passive kind of a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| But to go on up at least to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| And at that point, you know, we might want to do something different at Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| But not until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| And we certainly don't want to pull all that traffic out on Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| Chapman Highway and Moody right now is a real hard interstate or intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4162)|
| 1:09:33| to decide whether you're going straight ahead or turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I mean, we just have all kinds of problems right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| And what you're saying is we're going to make that permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Well, that's not what we would like to have at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| We're talking about widening the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I mean, we've spent a lot of meetings in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| People in South Knox will go to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| We said we want to widen the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| We want to be able to walk across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| We want to have bicycles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| And we're spending lots of money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| We're taking the whole thing down to fix it up and make it wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| And then we're talking about narrowing Henley Street that goes up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| That just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I would really appreciate you all putting any of that kind of plan off way to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| And we're living with the traffic because we want Henley Bridge fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| But don't make us permanently live with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| I mean, we're quietly accepting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| But please don't mess us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| We want to live in our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Our last speaker, and, again, I apologize if I pronounce your name wrong, Kevin Gimack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| Not close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Grimack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| But it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| If you'd pronounce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Grimack, G-R-I-M-A-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| 611, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| 713 South Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| And I want to appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| This is my first time to speak in front of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| I'm honored to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| I'm a lifelong Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| And I grew up a child of the 60s watching Kaz Walker, and I swear I still feel him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I know he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| I went to high school here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Went to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| And I want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| I can't go back in history like some of these folks have, can, but I do want to tell a brief experience that I think is very telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| 18 years ago, my wife and I purchased our first property in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| We purchased a building that had plywood on the windows and doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| And today, I think we've done quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| We still own that building, and I think we're very proud to call downtown Knoxville a gem in this city and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| And I would think anybody would argue that downtown Knoxville is a crown jewel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Having said that, I guess I have a different stance from the folks that I've heard because my take on it is it's a vision, and it's what can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4325)|
| 1:12:18| And downtown is now the trendiest, it's the most expensive real estate in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| I can't afford to do any more development in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| South Knoxville is a natural extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| So I guess what I'm saying is I see a horse of a different color here with Mr. Scott's proposal, and I think what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| And it's funny because while I hear the sky is falling and people, less traffic and less cars and less business in my restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| I think if now is the time to correct the Henley Street Bridge and correct the tour, the detour, calm the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4366)|
| 1:12:54| Right now you have a superhighway running from the tunnel through Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| If you calm the traffic, make it a place where people want to go, it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| It takes courage, but it also takes vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| I want to take a little exception with what Councilman Pavlis said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| This is not our road, but it is our city, and we really need to keep improving, keep making strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| We've had mistakes of the past, malfunction junction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| How many remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| It was a mistake before it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| We have a golden opportunity to do something beautiful with Henley Street and the Henley Street Bridge that's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| It takes courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| I thank you for your courage and your time, and we're looking for vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Any closing comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| First off, George, thank you for your presentation, and I hope you're not discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| I mean, you put together a nice, you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| The fact that we're having this meeting is very encouraging just to get these ideas out in the open in all points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Creative thinking is good, and keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| You're an innovative thinker, and you put together a really great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| I also really appreciate the work of Councilman Pavlis, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| and doing the groundwork of really touching base with how a great idea would have a direct impact on the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4465)|
| 1:14:34| That's what you need to do, and that's what you did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| I was the co-chair of the James White Chapman Highway Task Force with Councilman Hulquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4478)|
| 1:14:47| and one of the elements that came out loud and clear in that was public participation, and TDOT realized that that is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4487)|
| 1:14:57| And I feel like that's what Councilman Pavlis did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| On the ground, you took a piece of theory and found out what it would look like once it showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4502)|
| 1:15:13| And so any good innovator like yourself, Mr. Scott, needs to incorporate those impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| Would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| So anyway, I hope this workshop doesn't send you into some kind of depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| You did good work, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| George, I think you really succeeded today in getting a dialogue started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| which is, I think, one of the things that you've been trying to work on for the last six months to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| And I think one of the things that all of us need to realize is that I don't think you're coming here saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| this is the plan and this is what has to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| and that everyone needs to be afraid of what change could occur in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| because I think that what you're really talking about is a vision, and it's a vision for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| And I think probably all of us would agree that Henley Street is probably one of the ugliest streets that we have in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| And so what's happening is you're all of a sudden causing us to look at not only just that whole vision that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| but we have pieces that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| And it's, from what I understand, and council can correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| but I think that we have the Chapman Highway Corridor Study, we have the Magnolia Avenue Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| we have Cumberland Avenue Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| We have all these studies, and they're all coming together in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| And if you think about Henley Street and the importance of Henley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I don't think that you're necessarily saying, you know, hey, we've got to cut the traffic off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| I think that what you've done is you've said here are some alternatives to at least think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| And I think as we vision what we want our city to be, I think that's one of the things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| We need to look at all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| And as the last gentleman said, I mean, all of us can look at what I-40 and I-75 has done to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| There are actually cities in the country today who are not allowing interstates to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| They're cutting those interstates off because they're realizing the importance of the downtown area in that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| And so I not only commend you for what you've come up with, but I also commend you for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| I don't know how many times you called me on the telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| and I'm sure you did all the rest of the council members the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| And I think that one of the things that we as a council want to do is we want to encourage our citizens to become involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| and to begin to, you know, in some way have dialogue and get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| And I certainly appreciate what Nick, Councilman Pavlis, has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| and I understand where his heart and where his vision is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| But I also think that there's a way in which we can possibly, when we look at our whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| that we can bring all these things together, whether it's, you know, the South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| We need to think of ourselves as a whole city and not just individual areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| And I think this is a possibility in a way that some of us very early on when we came on to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| said that one of the things we want to do is we want to set a vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| and set a vision for what our city not only is, but what it can be and what it might be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| And that vision may take 50 years, but at least we can begin to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| And I think that's one of the successes today that you brought is that all of a sudden we're getting people to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you, Councilman Grebe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| I don't know if we still have our TPO person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I see Mark Donaldson back there certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Jeff Welch is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Jeff, you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| I guess one of my questions is we were talking earlier about the James White Parkway extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4724)|
| 1:18:53| at some point going to Chapman Highway or John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| And I remember maybe ten years ago when there was a furor during the Ash administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| about whether that road was going to divide communities down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| And somehow we managed to build a park in the middle of the roadbed or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| And it was kind of a traumatic period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| And part of that was, I guess, lack of dialogue with the community about road planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| something that Chris just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| But where do you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| I mean, do you see any impetus to complete that roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| All I can say at this point in time is the Department of Transportation is doing an environmental impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| on that corridor and looking at the alternatives that are available to extend it down to John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4775)|
| 1:19:43| and connecting up with Chapman at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Beyond that, there is no committed funds for right-of-way or construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| So that is where it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| This is like a ten-year plan or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Well, I would say at least a ten to 15 or 20-year plan, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| I mean, it's a difficult project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| There are some obstacles, both financial and political, that are going to have to be in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| And I can't stand up here and say it's going to be built because there's still a lot of steps in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4810)|
| 1:20:19| Part of its logic is the same one we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| which is, is there some way for the through traffic to avoid the local traffic on congested parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4823)|
| 1:20:32| I mean, that parkway or James White Parkway extension has been almost 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| in the early planning documents for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| So it's been there primarily for that reason, connecting the interstate and to the south and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| So again, this whole environmental impact statement will revisit those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| and engage the community in that dialogue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Was that bridge at one time intended to connect to Cherry Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| I think its earliest conceptions really was to connect to Cherry Street, you know, 60 years ago in earlier plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| But, you know, there was reasons why it did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| In conclusion here, I'd just like to remind the council that we do have an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| a Transportation Mobility Committee, which has several numerous knowledgeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| and talented people on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| And the co-chairman of that is Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| And I will recognize you here for just a brief moment, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| I appreciate you all taking the time to hear Mr. Scott and his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| And whether or not that proposal is viable as it's put on the table now or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I want to echo Councilman Greer's statement about vision and about moving the city forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| and appreciation for somebody that's willing to put a big idea on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| And one of the things I want to say in relation to this particular corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| and how this double corridor that we're talking about with Chapman and James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| Mr. Welch is exactly right based on my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| And, of course, he's extremely knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| But federal funds and state funds are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| We know that there are more projects and more demand chasing fewer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| And so priority is the key there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| And if we wait until population distribution, et cetera, justifies that becoming a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| we don't know when it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| It might be 20 years or however long that could end up taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| Once the IAS is done, it goes from there however it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| But if we as a city say from a policy standpoint, we really want to focus on these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| and this is something that personally I think we're going to have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| if we want to add population, we want to add vitality, we want to see mixed use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| our older aging commercial corridors are a great place to put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| You can't come in and wipe out single family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| Nobody wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| We know politically it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| So where does it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Well, it happens in our aging commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Now, Kingston Pike has a lot of turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| Property prices are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Demand is high for that property or was until the recession hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| But a lot of the other corridors aren't experiencing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and so how can we move the city forward and begin to think in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| how are we going to take in over the next 50 years another 100,000 to 200,000 in population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| or whatever those numbers might be rather than seeing them sprawl out into the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| Well, we need to begin to fix on those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| and if we say we're going to focus on these corridors and we're going to begin to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| and dialogue and talk about it and talk about big ideas, whether they're the best ideas or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| begin to talk about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| If we say let's focus on Chapman Highway Corridor, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| then if we have a plan, we have a vision to drive that forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| that in turn will affect how James White Parkway proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| It will affect the priority of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| So priorities are all malleable depending on where we want to go as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| and where the community as a whole puts its priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| The governor and the state legislature, TDOT, are responsive to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| So I would say let's keep talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Let's don't throw Mr. Scott's ideas out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Let's don't put them on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Let's say here's somebody with a big idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Now let's talk about that in the greater context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| And thank you all very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| It's 625, and we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5078)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110512?start=5108)|
