| 0:20:43| This is about these men and women, some of them that stand behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1243.02)|
| 0:20:46| those that are out there on the street, those that are working inside our three facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1246.02)|
| 0:20:52| And, yes, even our support group, those people who work in records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1252.02)|
| 0:20:57| Our officers can't do their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1257.02)|
| 0:20:59| if we don't have enough people working in our records division and our support unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1259.02)|
| 0:21:03| They're just as important to this agency as any position out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1263.02)|
| 0:21:12| I turned in a proposed budget asking for a 30% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1272.02)|
| 0:21:20| With that, there was a stipulation that I would be willing to give up 58 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1280.02)|
| 0:21:29| And as I told the mayor and the finance director at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1289.02)|
| 0:21:32| I may have to come back to county commission and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1292.02)|
| 0:21:34| hey, I need 10 positions once we start getting people to come on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1294.02)|
| 0:21:39| I may have to come back in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1299.02)|
| 0:21:41| It might be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1301.02)|
| 0:21:43| But I might have to come back and say, hey, I need 10 or 15 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1303.02)|
| 0:21:47| We are getting people that want to come to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1307.02)|
| 0:21:52| That was the biggest thing that I asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1312.02)|
| 0:21:54| And, yes, is it historical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1314.02)|
| 0:21:56| Absolutely it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1316.02)|
| 0:22:00| But it's about these men and women that work in this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1320.02)|
| 0:22:03| It's about the future of this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1323.02)|
| 0:22:06| And it's about the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1326.02)|
| 0:22:07| Because at the present, if I can't retain people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1327.02)|
| 0:22:11| then we can't attract people with the salary that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1331.02)|
| 0:22:16| I can tell you right now, I know of, and I'll go through my notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1336.02)|
| 0:22:20| we have a Sevier County officer that's got nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1340.02)|
| 0:22:23| He's a nine-year veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1343.02)|
| 0:22:25| Makes more than my captains do at $68,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1345.02)|
| 0:22:31| That should be embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1351.02)|
| 0:22:33| It's embarrassing to me because when I go out and I talk to the sheriffs across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1353.02)|
| 0:22:37| and whenever I tell them, look, we are the third largest county in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1357.02)|
| 0:22:43| And where do we rank as far as our pays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1363.02)|
| 0:22:45| We rank ninth with our correctional officer pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1365.02)|
| 0:22:51| We rank 13th with our law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1371.02)|
| 0:22:59| It's my job as a sheriff, and after almost 72% of the voters who voted last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1379.02)|
| 0:23:06| said that we were doing a good job, I want to make sure we continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1386.02)|
| 0:23:10| But I want to make sure that we take care of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1390.02)|
| 0:23:14| Most of all, we've got to take care of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1394.02)|
| 0:23:17| And if these men and women can't take care of the county, who are we going to rely on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1397.02)|
| 0:23:22| I'm not about to step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1402.02)|
| 0:23:24| You all are stuck with me for three more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1404.02)|
| 0:23:27| and I'm going to work until the last day I'm in office to make sure that this community is the best community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1407.02)|
| 0:23:33| You hear the mayor talk about this is the best community to work, live, and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1413.02)|
| 0:23:38| Let's make it the best to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1418.02)|
| 0:23:40| Let's pay these officers, these men and women, what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1420.02)|
| 0:23:44| Like I said, we did our research on this, and I'll be handing out to you all after I get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1424.02)|
| 0:23:50| We're going to hand you out at least one handout of what CTAS has put together as far as salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1430.02)|
| 0:23:56| and you'll see the numbers that I just quoted a while ago will be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1436.02)|
| 0:24:00| The mayor proposed a budget last Monday to giving all of Knox County employees 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1440.02)|
| 0:24:08| and then he said that he was giving an additional 5% to the sheriff's office, the captains in below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1448.02)|
| 0:24:16| I have to contradict that, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1456.02)|
| 0:24:20| Because when I turned my budget in, that budget was for 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1460.02)|
| 0:24:26| as long as those 50 positions are in at 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1466.02)|
| 0:24:33| He gave us 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1473.02)|
| 0:24:36| Those numbers don't add up, and that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1476.02)|
| 0:24:41| Did I agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1481.02)|
| 0:24:42| I agreed those positions to be given up with 30%, not 5%, not 6%, and not 7%, 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1482.02)|
| 0:24:55| So those positions are off the table, and I think you can understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1495.02)|
| 0:25:02| I was willing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1502.02)|
| 0:25:03| That was going to be 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1503.02)|
| 0:25:05| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1505.02)|
| 0:25:06| $2.3 million to be able to help out in any way that I felt like we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1506.02)|
| 0:25:13| but I cannot in good conscience, I cannot give up those positions and we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1513.02)|
| 0:25:19| or I shouldn't say we, I'm not involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1519.02)|
| 0:25:21| that these men and women at this agency get an additional 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1521.02)|
| 0:25:27| Let's just stay further behind then if that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1527.02)|
| 0:25:30| We are behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1530.02)|
| 0:25:31| I heard it was said, I don't know when it was, yesterday or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1531.02)|
| 0:25:35| but supposedly we're making $2,000 more a year than KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1535.02)|
| 0:25:39| I'd like to know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1539.02)|
| 0:25:42| These people back here, I'm sure they'll tell you that that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1542.02)|
| 0:25:47| But the thing about it is it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1547.02)|
| 0:25:50| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1550.02)|
| 0:25:52| If we were making $2,000 more a year than KPD, is that a bad thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1552.02)|
| 0:26:00| Is it bad that we want to be the best and the best paid agency in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1560.02)|
| 0:26:06| Is that a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1566.02)|
| 0:26:09| Lord, I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1569.02)|
| 0:26:10| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1570.02)|
| 0:26:11| I want to be, and when I leave here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1571.02)|
| 0:26:14| and I want these men and women that are proud when they work with this agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1574.02)|
| 0:26:19| that they've worked for an agency that took care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1579.02)|
| 0:26:23| They worked for a community and a commission that took care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1583.02)|
| 0:26:25| and a mayor's office that took care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1585.02)|
| 0:26:29| I have heard this more than I care to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1589.02)|
| 0:26:35| There's not a bigger supporter than me up here on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1595.02)|
| 0:26:41| Don't tell me that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1601.02)|
| 0:26:43| Don't tell these people back here that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1603.02)|
| 0:26:48| Do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1608.02)|
| 0:26:51| Show us in the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1611.02)|
| 0:26:53| You all have that authority to adjust the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1613.02)|
| 0:26:57| You have that authority, and I hope that you will at least look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1617.02)|
| 0:27:02| I told somebody, I'll get behind this lectern, and I'll get up here on the steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1622.02)|
| 0:27:06| and I'll get on my knees and I'll beg for it if that's what I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1626.02)|
| 0:27:09| I will absolutely beg for it because they're worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1629.02)|
| 0:27:16| I've lived in this community since 1972, except for a four-year stint in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1636.02)|
| 0:27:22| I've worked for this agency since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1642.02)|
| 0:27:25| This is my second family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1645.02)|
| 0:27:28| I've been blessed enough to have been elected sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1648.02)|
| 0:27:30| How in the world a Carter High School graduate can get elected sheriff is beyond me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1650.02)|
| 0:27:34| but here I am, and I've been asked to lead the third largest agency in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1654.02)|
| 0:27:40| and I'm not about to let them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1660.02)|
| 0:27:43| I'm not about to let you all down, and I'm not going to let this community down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1663.02)|
| 0:27:51| There was something said about me not doing a $5,000 bonus, sign-on bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1671.02)|
| 0:27:59| I have my pros and cons about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1679.02)|
| 0:28:02| and I look at it as it's great for a person who wants to come to work here to get a $5,000 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1682.02)|
| 0:28:08| but I also look at it as a morale issue with people who have been working here for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1688.02)|
| 0:28:12| and dedicated themselves and say, okay, what are you going to do for me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1692.02)|
| 0:28:15| What kind of bonus do I get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1695.02)|
| 0:28:17| So I'm on both sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1697.02)|
| 0:28:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1698.02)|
| 0:28:20| But don't say that the sheriff just didn't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1700.02)|
| 0:28:24| That's something that can be discussed, but it's still, I can give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1704.02)|
| 0:28:29| But make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1709.02)|
| 0:28:31| No mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1711.02)|

| 0:28:42| Are we going to reduce our services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1722.02)|
| 0:28:44| Can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1724.02)|

| 0:29:04| these men and women do things that or will be involved in something that the average person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1744.02)|
| 0:29:10| will never have to deal with in their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1750.02)|

| 0:29:16| What you heard on that audio is just one of the things that, obviously, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1756.02)|
| 0:29:36| the average person will never have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1776.02)|
| 0:29:43| As I said, it's not about me, but I have to say that I was there after the fact of that shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1783.02)|
| 0:29:48| because I was a member of the SWAT team and trying to find that individual that assaulted our officers at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1788.02)|

| 0:30:05| We go back to what somebody said about KPD making more than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1805.02)|
| 0:30:09| Let's talk about KPD having their career development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1809.02)|
| 0:30:12| They also pay their people for their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1812.02)|
| 0:30:18| They pay them for their master's, their bachelor's, their associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1818.02)|
| 0:30:22| That career development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1822.02)|
| 0:30:23| They also have a drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1823.02)|
| 0:30:30| They also have a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1830.02)|
| 0:30:33| That brings me to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1833.02)|
| 0:30:40| Friday, I believe it was, the pension retirement board had a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1840.02)|
| 0:30:47| to talk about these officers' pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1847.02)|
| 0:30:50| What would this 30% increase do to the UOP, to the STAR, to 401K, whatever it may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1850.02)|
| 0:31:02| I hit the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1862.02)|
| 0:31:03| A man of my vertically challenged stature hit the freaking ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1863.02)|
| 0:31:07| when I heard that maybe we want to talk about punishing these officers to take something away from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1867.02)|
| 0:31:12| because they possibly might get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1872.02)|
| 0:31:17| Every one of them worked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1877.02)|
| 0:31:20| And it's sad that we have somebody who says, well, we might not be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1880.02)|
| 0:31:27| If we had done what was supposed to have been done many years ago whenever the UOP was put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1887.02)|
| 0:31:33| we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1893.02)|
| 0:31:34| I wouldn't be here standing today and have to argue and defend and fight for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1894.02)|
| 0:31:39| I don't want to have to come to you all every year asking for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1899.02)|
| 0:31:43| That's not in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1903.02)|
| 0:31:46| But it's in me because I care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1906.02)|
| 0:31:50| If I didn't care, I could just sit back for my next three years and say, heck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1910.02)|
| 0:31:54| Let's do what we do and tell the officers good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1914.02)|
| 0:31:58| But that's not in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1918.02)|
| 0:32:00| And you all would have my backside if I acted like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1920.02)|
| 0:32:03| And you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1923.02)|
| 0:32:04| And this community should do everything they could to put me out on my ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1924.02)|
| 0:32:09| But that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1929.02)|
| 0:32:11| But don't threaten and scare or put a scare tactic into people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1931.02)|
| 0:32:21| You know, it comes back to, and I know it was asked of the mayor yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1941.02)|
| 0:32:24| or at least on the program that was probably taped Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1944.02)|
| 0:32:29| if he'd be willing to do a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1949.02)|
| 0:32:33| And nobody wants to talk about a property tax increase, but I want to give you a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1953.02)|
| 0:32:37| And this number comes from not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1957.02)|
| 0:32:41| These numbers come from the collaboration of my finance director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1961.02)|
| 0:32:47| and the county's finance director, sitting down and coming up with these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1967.02)|
| 0:32:52| for what we have asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1972.02)|
| 0:32:54| And I think you saw this when it came out last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1974.02)|
| 0:32:58| Our tax rate, a penny was bringing in $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1978.02)|
| 0:33:05| Physical year 24 is bringing in $1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1985.02)|
| 0:33:10| So with that being said, and I'm sure you'll have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1990.02)|
| 0:33:14| with everything running together, I may have Allison at least explain the number we come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1994.02)|
| 0:33:19| or they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1999.02)|
| 0:33:21| But if it went to a property tax increase, we're talking seven cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2001.02)|
| 0:33:27| We're talking about a homeowner of a $425,000 home, $75 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2007.02)|

| 0:33:39| And trust me, I understand we have people who are on fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2019.02)|
| 0:33:43| I'm not oblivious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2023.02)|
| 0:33:45| I'm not blind to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2025.02)|
| 0:33:48| I said it the other day, I think, when I talked to some of the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2028.02)|
| 0:33:51| and I said I don't think that the community will have a huge, huge problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2031.02)|
| 0:33:55| if they knew exactly where it was going, especially for their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2035.02)|

| 0:34:05| But we've got to be able to continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2045.02)|
| 0:34:07| We've had over 25,000 to 30,000 people moving here over the past two and a half to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2047.02)|
| 0:34:14| We've lost people within the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2054.02)|
| 0:34:19| How does Buddies, what does Buddies do over the past several years to stay in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2059.02)|
| 0:34:26| and have to raise their prices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2066.02)|
| 0:34:28| I'll just use them as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2068.02)|
| 0:34:30| I just brought that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2070.02)|
| 0:34:34| But we are expected to continue with the same services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2074.02)|
| 0:34:39| for a community that has grown by 25,000 to 30,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2079.02)|
| 0:34:46| And how do we show that appreciation to those men and women that are out there protecting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2086.02)|
| 0:34:51| Because as I go back, and I cannot say it enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2091.02)|
| 0:34:55| for these men and women and for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2095.02)|
| 0:35:07| I've heard it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2107.02)|
| 0:35:08| We compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2108.02)|
| 0:35:09| I don't know why we do this, but I'm sure that KPD does it as well, at least the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2109.02)|
| 0:35:13| We compare each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2113.02)|
| 0:35:18| It doesn't matter who's getting paid the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2118.02)|
| 0:35:21| It matters who's getting paid properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2121.02)|
| 0:35:30| If they're making more than us, it shouldn't matter as long as we're making a decent pay and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2130.02)|
| 0:35:37| But don't punish these men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2137.02)|

| 0:37:42| When I tell you we're short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2262.02)|
| 0:37:44| by the number of inmates that we have within our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2264.02)|

| 0:37:51| our staffing is at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2271.02)|
| 0:37:56| That's how critical we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2276.02)|

| 0:38:07| With that being said, and before you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2287.02)|
| 0:38:10| I've got two people I want to introduce to you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2290.02)|
| 0:38:29| To my right is retired Sergeant Matty Baird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2309.02)|
| 0:38:34| and to my left is retired Captain James Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2314.02)|
| 0:38:45| James is the voice you heard on that audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2325.02)|
| 0:38:51| Both of these men were ambushed, answering a domestic call in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2331.02)|
| 0:39:00| As you can tell, Matthew was shot in the head, about 30-06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2340.02)|
| 0:39:13| Hit his hand first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2353.02)|
| 0:39:15| Dislodged his right finger and part of his thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2355.02)|
| 0:39:23| James almost has his arm blown off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2363.02)|
| 0:39:29| This is a guy who sit and wait because, as you heard on the audio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2369.02)|
| 0:39:33| that this was a domestic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2373.02)|
| 0:39:35| and she was going to go there to retrieve some of her items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2375.02)|
| 0:39:39| before he threatened to burn the house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2379.02)|
| 0:39:47| They never got out of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2387.02)|
| 0:39:50| James was able to get the female complainant into his vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2390.02)|
| 0:39:57| and get her out of danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2397.02)|
| 0:40:02| What happened...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2402.02)|
| 0:40:07| As you heard James say, it's hard, he can't get out on the radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2407.02)|
| 0:40:12| We didn't have mobiles back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2412.02)|
| 0:40:14| Here we are again, the third level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2414.02)|
| 0:40:16| We didn't have mobiles back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2416.02)|
| 0:40:18| Here we are again, the third largest agency in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2418.02)|
| 0:40:21| and we don't have the damn proper equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2421.02)|
| 0:40:24| It took that incident before we could get mobile radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2424.02)|
| 0:40:29| so that we could have communication within most of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2429.02)|
| 0:40:33| All the way back to 1991,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2433.02)|
| 0:40:36| and somebody's going to say, well, this happened way back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2436.02)|
| 0:40:39| Let it happen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2439.02)|
| 0:40:47| That's harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2447.02)|
| 0:40:52| It's really harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2452.02)|
| 0:40:56| I talked to these two guys the other day, and I told them, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2456.02)|
| 0:40:59| I don't mean to use you in this manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2459.02)|
| 0:41:04| but I don't think somebody's going to do that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2464.02)|
| 0:41:07| I don't think somebody's going to do that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2467.02)|
| 0:41:10| I don't think somebody's going to do that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2470.02)|
| 0:41:13| I don't mean to use you in this manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2473.02)|
| 0:41:15| but I don't think some people understand the dangers of this job totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2475.02)|
| 0:41:19| These two guys gave, they sacrificed almost the ultimatum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2479.02)|
| 0:41:25| They made a sacrifice to protect this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2485.02)|
| 0:41:28| and this is the sacrifice that they took and they were willing to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2488.02)|
| 0:41:34| Thank God they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2494.02)|
| 0:41:37| And I'm proud to have them standing beside me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2497.02)|
| 0:41:40| and I know that they support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2500.02)|
| 0:41:42| I know they support these men and women back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2502.02)|
| 0:41:45| They're still part of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2505.02)|
| 0:41:50| And I'm honored to stand beside both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2510.02)|
| 0:41:52| because both of these two guys are friends, coworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2512.02)|
| 0:41:57| and proud to have them be retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2517.02)|
| 0:42:00| to be able to enjoy the rest of what they have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2520.02)|
| 0:42:04| Guys, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2524.02)|
| 0:42:06| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2526.02)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2528.02)|
| 0:42:23| I will make sure that you all get a copy of this retention and recruiting pamphlet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2543.02)|
| 0:42:30| that CTAS put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2550.02)|
| 0:42:33| Just another thing that went around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2553.02)|
| 0:42:35| This is the flyer that went around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2555.02)|
| 0:42:37| and I know you probably can't see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2557.02)|
| 0:42:39| for Hamilton County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2559.02)|
| 0:42:42| When they kind of did the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2562.02)|
| 0:42:44| and that's kind of where I got the model from as far as the positions are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2564.02)|
| 0:42:47| $50,000 starting out for their corrections deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2567.02)|
| 0:42:50| and it was 51 for their school resource officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2570.02)|
| 0:42:53| and it went up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2573.02)|
| 0:42:55| So there again, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2575.02)|
| 0:42:58| But again, I'm going to come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2578.02)|
| 0:43:01| and tell you that if I need to get up here and beg for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2581.02)|
| 0:43:04| then I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2584.02)|
| 0:43:06| But take anything of what you think about me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2586.02)|
| 0:43:08| take it and put it aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2588.02)|
| 0:43:11| and give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2591.02)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2593.02)|

| 0:43:34| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2614.02)|

| 0:43:39| Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2619.02)|
| 0:43:41| I'd like to thank the officers that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2621.02)|
| 0:43:44| the two officers that came down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2624.02)|
| 0:43:46| Mattie Baird and I actually know James Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2626.02)|
| 0:43:49| And I do appreciate everything that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2629.02)|
| 0:43:53| The questions that I'm going to be asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2633.02)|
| 0:43:56| does not diminish what I think the job that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2636.02)|
| 0:44:01| and how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2641.02)|
| 0:44:03| I'm asking the question to your CEO of the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2643.02)|
| 0:44:07| and I have to answer to my constituents that call me and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2647.02)|
| 0:44:14| And I feel like that a lot of times everybody gets a couple seconds of snippets on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2654.02)|
| 0:44:21| You, the mayor, maybe some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2661.02)|
| 0:44:25| And I don't think all the information actually gets out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2665.02)|
| 0:44:28| So for people that are here, people that are going to be watching later and right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2668.02)|
| 0:44:32| I think it's a good opportunity to get as much on the record for taxpayers to understand what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2672.02)|
| 0:44:39| because this is a big ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2679.02)|
| 0:44:41| And we're not in an economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2681.02)|
| 0:44:45| I don't think that any of us can say that we're in an economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2685.02)|
| 0:44:50| that it's easy for anybody right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2690.02)|
| 0:44:54| It's not easy for officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2694.02)|
| 0:44:55| It's not easy for our county employees who got a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2695.02)|
| 0:44:59| It's not easy for teachers who got a 4% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2699.02)|
| 0:45:05| So it's not to diminish the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2705.02)|
| 0:45:08| and I want to make sure that that is very clear because that is not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2708.02)|
| 0:45:12| It is to talk to the sheriff as the CEO of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2712.02)|
| 0:45:19| So if we're on the same page, then I'm ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2719.02)|
| 0:45:24| The mayor did offer an 8% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2724.02)|
| 0:45:28| And when you were talking about KPD, and I've lived in Knox County all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2728.02)|
| 0:45:32| so it has always been the sheriff's office has always compared the sheriff's pay with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2732.02)|
| 0:45:40| I'm not saying that's right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2740.02)|
| 0:45:42| That's just always been the standard we've always talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2742.02)|
| 0:45:46| that we would lose officers going a mile down the road and they never had to move their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2746.02)|
| 0:45:52| So I don't think when the mayor or when the commission looks at saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2752.02)|
| 0:45:57| now you're going to be making more than KPD, that is to diminish anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2757.02)|
| 0:46:02| It's just what the numbers are telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2762.02)|
| 0:46:06| So let me just go over a few numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2766.02)|
| 0:46:10| The average salary in Knox County is $41,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2770.02)|
| 0:46:15| With the proposed 8% salary increase proposed by Mayor Jacobs, that would put our officers at $48,399.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2775.02)|
| 0:46:25| Where the $63,303 comes in is including the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2785.02)|
| 0:46:32| If I have my math right, that is $21,603 over the average salary in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2792.02)|
| 0:46:41| So when we talk about KPD and KCSO, there is a comparison there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2801.02)|
| 0:46:48| and the officers will be making more with an 8% salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2808.02)|
| 0:46:53| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2813.02)|
| 0:46:55| Did you add the benefits in for KPD salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2815.02)|
| 0:47:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2821.02)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2822.02)|
| 0:47:06| Does the starting pay end up being more for KCO than it does for KPD next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2826.02)|
| 0:47:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2831.02)|
| 0:47:12| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2832.02)|
| 0:47:13| The starting salary will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2833.02)|
| 0:47:14| No, because where you're wrong is you keep saying the mayor offered 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2834.02)|
| 0:47:21| No, he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2841.02)|
| 0:47:23| He offered 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2843.02)|
| 0:47:24| That other 5%, as I mentioned, came from the positions that I was willing to give up on the stipulation of a 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2844.02)|
| 0:47:33| So that's off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2853.02)|
| 0:47:35| We'll get to the positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2855.02)|
| 0:47:40| I am curious where you're getting a 10% increase for chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2860.02)|
| 0:47:45| Now, we talk about recruitment and we talk about retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2865.02)|
| 0:47:48| I can't imagine those positions and that high of a position is a real problem for retention or recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2868.02)|
| 0:47:56| Well, part of that is because of the responsibilities that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2876.02)|
| 0:48:00| They've been loyal to the agency as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2880.02)|
| 0:48:02| You say that they're how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2882.02)|
| 0:48:05| Well, you want a 10% increase for the chiefs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2885.02)|
| 0:48:14| And that figure also is in there because here's what it ended up being, $133,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2894.02)|
| 0:48:19| You're thinking it's probably going to be a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2899.02)|
| 0:48:22| But if I don't make the adjustment, your captains are going to be making more than your chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2902.02)|
| 0:48:26| and your chiefs have more responsibility than your captains do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2906.02)|
| 0:48:29| So it's just like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2909.02)|
| 0:48:30| If you don't make the adjustments for everybody else, it's just like your starting salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2910.02)|
| 0:48:35| Those people that were making, let's say if the starting salary goes to $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2915.02)|
| 0:48:39| those people who are making $49,000, they have to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2919.02)|
| 0:48:43| Those people who have been here for five years making $51,000 have to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2923.02)|
| 0:48:48| Or $51,000, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2928.02)|
| 0:48:50| So all the adjustments have to be made in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2930.02)|
| 0:48:53| We're talking, what, four within our corrections side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2933.02)|
| 0:48:56| and then five on the law enforcement side as far as chiefs at $133,000, and that's an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2936.02)|
| 0:49:02| I mean, every bit of this is an issue, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2942.02)|
| 0:49:09| You talked about UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2949.02)|
| 0:49:13| I think that it has to be understood by the public that UOP is an expense to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2953.02)|
| 0:49:23| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2963.02)|
| 0:49:25| So if we do a 30% tax increase, we have to match that in UOP, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2965.02)|
| 0:49:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2972.02)|
| 0:49:33| We're talking millions of dollars, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2973.02)|
| 0:49:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2975.02)|
| 0:49:36| Which I don't think that in the snippets that's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2976.02)|
| 0:49:40| I'm not saying anything about UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2980.02)|
| 0:49:44| I'm just saying that is a fact that needs to be out there, and it's not been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2984.02)|
| 0:49:54| I would like to talk about the 58 positions that were going to be given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2994.02)|
| 0:50:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3000.02)|
| 0:50:02| Today I asked Director Caldwell, out of the 58 positions that were being offered up by you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3002.02)|
| 0:50:10| how many of those were correction officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3010.02)|
| 0:50:13| I was told 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3013.02)|
| 0:50:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3014.02)|
| 0:50:16| Somebody that sat on the Merit Council, we knew how bad correction numbers were down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3016.02)|
| 0:50:23| As of right now, I think you've got 194 officers with 71 supervisors in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3023.02)|
| 0:50:32| Help me understand how you, even at 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3032.02)|
| 0:50:37| you were going to give up 50 correction officer positions when you were short-staffed over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3037.02)|
| 0:50:43| Did you hear what I said about those 50 positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3043.02)|
| 0:50:47| When I said that I told them at that time, I probably, and may come back to commission and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3047.02)|
| 0:50:52| I need 10 more, 20 more positions now because people are starting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3052.02)|
| 0:50:59| That was a number that we sit down with, with my command staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3059.02)|
| 0:51:02| with my command staff within my corrections division who have over 28 years of working in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3062.02)|
| 0:51:09| or at least within the corrections division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3069.02)|
| 0:51:11| They know how strapped they've been now, and they understand what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3071.02)|
| 0:51:17| and part of that is retention and recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3077.02)|
| 0:51:20| It has everything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3080.02)|
| 0:51:24| I guess I'm, maybe just help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3084.02)|
| 0:51:29| If you were going to give those positions up and you got 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3089.02)|
| 0:51:34| and people didn't come out in droves to be law enforcement with that 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3094.02)|
| 0:51:42| you were going to be back here, if I understand it correctly, asking for those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3102.02)|
| 0:51:48| Once we started filling those positions and then we started getting to a point to where we could hire some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3108.02)|
| 0:51:54| yeah, and that's what I told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3114.02)|
| 0:51:55| I said, look, I'm willing to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3115.02)|
| 0:51:57| I may have to come back and ask for some of those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3117.02)|
| 0:52:00| but it's just like everybody else that I know of within the state that I've talked to with the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3120.02)|
| 0:52:06| Some of the things that they're doing, we're trying to find any way and every way that we can temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3126.02)|
| 0:52:11| to be able to bring people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3131.02)|
| 0:52:13| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3133.02)|
| 0:52:15| It may not bring in a drove of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3135.02)|
| 0:52:18| but tell me what else we have as a sheriff's office to bring people here if I can't give them a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3138.02)|
| 0:52:27| That just concerns me, and that seems dangerous in itself for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3147.02)|
| 0:52:33| How is it dangerous, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3153.02)|
| 0:52:34| That the officers that are already there, if you're going to be giving up positions and we're already short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3154.02)|
| 0:52:39| that to me seems dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3159.02)|
| 0:52:40| Just as our command staff within our facility has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3160.02)|
| 0:52:44| if we got 30 bodies today, we would think we were in heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3164.02)|
| 0:52:53| Let me ask about the ACA certified TCA and PREA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3173.02)|
| 0:53:01| So the agency must comply with the standards related to staffing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3181.02)|
| 0:53:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3185.02)|
| 0:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3186.02)|
| 0:53:07| Both PREA and ACA require staffing analysis and proof of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3187.02)|
| 0:53:11| Can you provide the commission with a copy of the staffing analysis and the proof of compliance and the documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3191.02)|
| 0:53:17| Should be able to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3197.02)|
| 0:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3198.02)|
| 0:53:19| And I'd like that for the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3199.02)|
| 0:53:23| Can you provide the past three years' assessment of your staffing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3203.02)|
| 0:53:27| where you documented the need for adjustments to your staffing plan for us to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3207.02)|
| 0:53:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3211.02)|
| 0:53:32| And why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3212.02)|
| 0:53:34| Because I've come to this commission asking for small increments of raises just to keep up with the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3214.02)|
| 0:53:41| and keeping up with the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3221.02)|
| 0:53:43| So we've not come to you asking you for something astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3223.02)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3229.02)|
| 0:53:50| I have got a fact sheet that is sourced from a recent CTAS study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3230.02)|
| 0:54:00| And I'm not sure if that's what you're going to be handing out to us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3240.02)|
| 0:54:03| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3243.02)|

| 0:56:09| I would think with the situation that the sheriff's office is in with shortage of officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3369.02)|
| 0:56:19| if free money is kind of given to bring somebody in, that is kind of hard to turn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3379.02)|

| 0:56:29| So do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3389.02)|
| 0:56:30| What I don't understand is why every department in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3390.02)|
| 0:56:35| adopted the maternity and paternity leave and your office decided not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3395.02)|
| 0:56:39| Well, that's a good answer right there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3399.02)|
| 0:56:41| And that is, one, because of our shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3401.02)|
| 0:56:44| And number two, a lot of those people are either gone for 12 weeks, however it takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3404.02)|
| 0:56:51| and now they're going to be gone for another six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3411.02)|
| 0:56:53| And I understand that they're entitled to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3413.02)|
| 0:56:56| But there is just no way that we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3416.02)|
| 0:56:59| You may think that we operate Monday through Friday and just eight to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3419.02)|
| 0:57:04| That's not the way that we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3424.02)|
| 0:57:06| So we have a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week job that we have to be able to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3426.02)|
| 0:57:12| And when that shortage comes around, yeah, it takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3432.02)|
| 0:57:15| But that's a good recruiting tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3435.02)|
| 0:57:19| So is the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3439.02)|
| 0:57:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3440.02)|
| 0:57:24| I saw your press conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3444.02)|
| 0:57:26| It was a short time after the mayor's budget address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3446.02)|
| 0:57:33| And you're the one who mentioned a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3453.02)|
| 0:57:37| No, it was asked of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3457.02)|
| 0:57:38| I didn't mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3458.02)|
| 0:57:40| But you agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3460.02)|
| 0:57:41| Would I agree what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3461.02)|
| 0:57:42| That you would file a lawsuit if you didn't get your 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3462.02)|
| 0:57:46| That was a, as I said, that would be a last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3466.02)|
| 0:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3470.02)|
| 0:57:51| Let me ask Director Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3471.02)|
| 0:57:53| help me to understand how the process works for the sheriff to receive outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3473.02)|
| 0:57:58| Well, if we get into a situation where there's intra-governmental litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3478.02)|
| 0:58:04| where two office holders that the Knox County Law Director's Office normally represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3484.02)|
| 0:58:09| are in a litigation posture against each other, we step out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3489.02)|
| 0:58:13| we hire counsel for both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3493.02)|
| 0:58:17| and we pay for it out of our budget that we have for that purpose, the outside counsel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3497.02)|
| 0:58:22| Would that be an amount that you would have to agree on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3502.02)|
| 0:58:25| And if the amount goes over that amount, then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3505.02)|
| 0:58:29| Well, there's no limitation on the amount, on what it costs for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3509.02)|
| 0:58:34| So it could just cost Knox County taxpayers a million, million and a half dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3514.02)|
| 0:58:38| for the sheriff to sue the county, the county commission, and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3518.02)|
| 0:58:43| I would think it would be less than that, but it could be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3523.02)|
| 0:58:46| Probably $500 at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3526.02)|
| 0:58:49| I have to say, Sheriff, talking about that lawsuit to me seems dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3529.02)|
| 0:58:56| because agencies shouldn't be suing each other because we can't come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3536.02)|
| 0:59:06| I'm hoping that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3546.02)|
| 0:59:08| Well, hope and being willing to come to the table, you know, are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3548.02)|
| 0:59:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3557.02)|
| 0:59:18| And it's real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3558.02)|
| 0:59:19| I've already had probably ten of my constituents call me as soon as your press conference is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3559.02)|
| 0:59:26| saying, are you serious that we're going to sue, the sheriff is going to sue the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3566.02)|
| 0:59:31| and we're going to have to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3571.02)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, and I had just as many supporting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3574.02)|
| 0:59:42| That's all of my questions, but I have to say I'm not in favor of agencies within the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3582.02)|
| 0:59:53| suing each other and wasting taxpayer dollars on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3593.02)|
| 0:59:59| because I think there's a resolution that could be met, and that's disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3599.02)|
| 1:00:07| It's still not out of the question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3607.02)|
| 1:00:10| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3610.02)|
| 1:00:13| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3613.02)|
| 1:00:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I saw you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3615.02)|

| 1:00:20| Sheriff, I'm a numbers guy, as you know, so I just want to clarify some things with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3620.02)|
| 1:00:28| Currently in this proposed budget, you list that you have 1,051 employees under your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3628.02)|
| 1:00:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3636.02)|
| 1:00:39| 1,068.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3639.02)|
| 1:00:40| It's actually 1,068.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3640.02)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3642.02)|
| 1:00:45| And your proposed budget from the mayor's office as it stands now is $107,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3645.02)|
| 1:00:53| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3653.02)|
| 1:00:54| I'm going to let Allison answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3654.02)|
| 1:00:56| I probably should have just asked for her first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3656.02)|
| 1:00:57| You promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3657.02)|
| 1:01:02| Do you want to identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3662.02)|
| 1:01:05| Allison Rogers, Knott's County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3665.02)|
| 1:01:08| Last year's budget was a little over $95 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3668.02)|
| 1:01:11| I believe I saw in this proposed budget it's actually $101 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3671.02)|
| 1:01:15| I think there's a couple other departments not part of the sheriff's office that's listed as public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3675.02)|
| 1:01:20| Okay, so it's $101 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3680.02)|
| 1:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3682.02)|
| 1:01:24| And the sheriff indicated that our current, we know that coming up, our tax rate will generate about $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3684.02)|
| 1:01:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3693.02)|
| 1:01:34| So that comes to, at the seven cents, that comes to $13,300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3694.02)|
| 1:01:40| Pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3700.02)|
| 1:01:41| So when he's talking about the 30%, that sounds great, but what is the actual number that he needs to do what he needs to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3701.02)|
| 1:01:49| to get everybody, the raises, up to, I mean, below captains?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3709.02)|
| 1:01:54| What is that dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3714.02)|
| 1:01:56| I can tell you that his total proposal cost is $17.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3716.02)|
| 1:02:04| It does include the UOP year one cost of $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3724.02)|
| 1:02:10| It includes the additional benefits, your Social Security, and the STAR and the 401K plan cost, and that's your $17.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3730.02)|
| 1:02:20| We took what was already proposed in the budget for FY24, so we took those expenses off, the $2.3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3740.02)|
| 1:02:28| those 58 positions he was willing to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3748.02)|
| 1:02:31| We also took the benefits associated with that, along with the 3% in pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3751.02)|
| 1:02:37| And that's your $13.3 million is what it would, the actual cost for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3757.02)|
| 1:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3764.02)|
| 1:02:45| That's where your seven cents comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3765.02)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3767.02)|
| 1:02:49| And help me out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3769.02)|
| 1:02:52| I believe about two years ago the sheriff's office commissioned a third-party consultant to do a report for the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3772.02)|
| 1:03:02| on all of the surrounding counties and jurisdictions as far as salaries and benefits and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3782.02)|
| 1:03:09| And that was about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3789.02)|
| 1:03:12| Has that consultant submitted that report to the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3792.02)|
| 1:03:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3796.02)|
| 1:03:17| Unfortunately, they emailed me back and said they could not finish the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3797.02)|
| 1:03:20| It started during COVID, and they did not have the staff and could not give us the final results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3800.02)|
| 1:03:25| So we never received any final results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3805.02)|
| 1:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3808.02)|
| 1:03:29| And then you never reinstituted that mechanism of a consultant to look at the salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3809.02)|
| 1:03:36| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3816.02)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3817.02)|
| 1:03:38| Did it end up costing you any money then since they didn't even do any work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3818.02)|
| 1:03:42| How they originally charged us, it was a total of $24,999 they charged us for that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3822.02)|
| 1:03:48| We paid, what they gave us was, I think it was phase one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3828.02)|
| 1:03:52| We did have to pay about half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3832.02)|
| 1:03:54| Of course, we paid that up front once they completed those phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3834.02)|
| 1:03:58| And so since they did not complete phase three and four, we did not pay that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3838.02)|
| 1:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3842.02)|
| 1:04:03| So is any of that information that they provided to you relevant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3843.02)|
| 1:04:06| No, it's three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3846.02)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3848.02)|
| 1:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3849.02)|
| 1:04:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3850.02)|
| 1:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3851.02)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3852.02)|
| 1:04:16| Commissioner Lee, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3856.02)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3859.02)|
| 1:04:22| Sheriff and all you law enforcements that are here, I just want to tell you thank you for showing up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3862.02)|
| 1:04:29| and thank you for what you do, and thank you for all the officers that put your life on the line every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3869.02)|
| 1:04:37| Sheriff, I just want to ask you, what can we cut out of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3877.02)|
| 1:04:49| Well, I'm not sure where you can cut from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3889.02)|
| 1:04:56| My attempt to show my good faith was trying to cut at least $2.3 million off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3896.02)|
| 1:05:03| But that's why you all have that decision to say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3903.02)|
| 1:05:09| You have that authority, and you have the authority to make adjustments if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3909.02)|
| 1:05:14| Obviously, I understand that the mayor also has another authority as well to either veto it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3914.02)|
| 1:05:22| but it's because of the tough decisions that I make that I have to come to here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3922.02)|
| 1:05:29| and ask you all to make another tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3929.02)|
| 1:05:32| And if I could ask you another question regarding the PREA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3932.02)|
| 1:05:36| Can you tell us the relief factor for an eight-hour post five days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3936.02)|
| 1:05:41| and an eight-hour post for seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3941.02)|
| 1:05:44| Do you have those numbers, Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3944.02)|
| 1:05:46| The post for the people working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3946.02)|
| 1:05:49| For the PREA, the relief factor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3949.02)|
| 1:05:51| Yeah, I'm pretty sure that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3951.02)|
| 1:05:53| I know we keep up with the PREA stats anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3953.02)|
| 1:05:55| Okay, can you provide us that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3955.02)|
| 1:05:57| Yeah, I'll get with our jail people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3957.02)|
| 1:06:02| And if I could ask the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3962.02)|
| 1:06:06| is the law department going to pay for a lawsuit out of the law director's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3966.02)|
| 1:06:13| We have, and have every year, a budgetary line item for outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3973.02)|
| 1:06:18| and it is specifically for those circumstances where we have a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3978.02)|
| 1:06:23| and have to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3983.02)|
| 1:06:26| In the past, when I was law director before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3986.02)|
| 1:06:28| that was mostly to deal with lawsuits by particular people against elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3988.02)|
| 1:06:36| But it's also what we have used traditionally when there, on the rare occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3996.02)|
| 1:06:42| is intra-governmental litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4002.02)|
| 1:06:45| So, for example, back when I was law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4005.02)|
| 1:06:48| the school board sued the county and the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4008.02)|
| 1:06:52| and the county mayor over some disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4012.02)|
| 1:06:55| So these things happen occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4015.02)|
| 1:06:57| The state law provides specifically for salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4017.02)|
| 1:07:03| It is a fairly archaic way of doing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4023.02)|
| 1:07:07| but generally what happens each and every year is this body will pass a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4027.02)|
| 1:07:11| and the various elected officials that have the salary suits will file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4031.02)|
| 1:07:15| basically to comply with the law, a salary suit that's signed off by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4035.02)|
| 1:07:19| because there's been an agreement between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4039.02)|
| 1:07:24| But the provision is there for the elected official to litigate, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4044.02)|
| 1:07:31| for the number of positions and the salary level that he or she believes is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4051.02)|
| 1:07:36| for him, she, or him to carry out his constitutional duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4056.02)|
| 1:07:41| In this particular case, the sheriff is charged with process service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4061.02)|
| 1:07:45| maintaining the jail, and being the chief law enforcement officer of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4065.02)|
| 1:07:51| He has an opinion about what's required to carry out his constitutional duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4071.02)|
| 1:07:56| and if, in his opinion, he has not provided sufficient resources to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4076.02)|
| 1:08:03| then he has the opportunity under state law to go to a judge and make his case to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4083.02)|
| 1:08:09| The judge at that point can agree, disagree, land somewhere in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4089.02)|
| 1:08:14| but that's how salary suits work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4094.02)|
| 1:08:18| My memory goes back pretty far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4098.02)|
| 1:08:20| I can't remember us having a contested salary suit in Knox County in the last 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4100.02)|
| 1:08:26| but I stand to be corrected on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4106.02)|
| 1:08:29| And does the amount for that have to be approved by the commission, or how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4109.02)|
| 1:08:35| It is part of our budgetary line item every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4115.02)|
| 1:08:38| I think, David, it's about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4118.02)|
| 1:08:44| It's part of our budget each and every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4124.02)|
| 1:08:47| Most years I think we don't come anywhere close to utilizing it, but it's there if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4127.02)|
| 1:08:52| In the past there have been times where we met and exceeded it under some pretty extraordinary circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4132.02)|
| 1:08:58| but I don't think that's happened in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4138.02)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4142.02)|
| 1:09:03| And if I could ask Mr. Caldwell to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4143.02)|
| 1:09:11| Director Caldwell, could you please come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4151.02)|
| 1:09:34| Mr. Caldwell, I believe I had asked you previously about the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4174.02)|
| 1:09:42| If I'm not mistaken, was it in five years that it would cost the county $60 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4182.02)|
| 1:09:49| So the 30% increase on UOP that we had the actuary to do the calculation of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4189.02)|
| 1:10:00| I know the impact is $60 million over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4200.02)|
| 1:10:04| I do believe that five years from now it was close to $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4204.02)|
| 1:10:09| I think it capped at about $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4209.02)|
| 1:10:11| I think in five years it was about $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4211.02)|
| 1:10:13| $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4213.02)|
| 1:10:14| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4214.02)|
| 1:10:15| I'll verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4215.02)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4219.02)|
| 1:10:20| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4220.02)|
| 1:10:21| That's all I have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4221.02)|
| 1:10:24| Commissioner Hill, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4224.02)|
| 1:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4226.02)|
| 1:10:27| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler and all your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4227.02)|
| 1:10:32| Thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4232.02)|
| 1:10:35| Just a few questions quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4235.02)|
| 1:10:38| How long have you had 58 vacancies, Sheriff, or however many you have at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4238.02)|
| 1:10:47| Well, we've consistently had vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4247.02)|
| 1:10:50| but I'm not sure when you're talking about the ones that I said that I would be willing to relinquish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4250.02)|
| 1:10:56| for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4256.02)|
| 1:10:59| Obviously, it's taken a toll even when COVID started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4259.02)|
| 1:11:03| and that's when it started really going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4263.02)|
| 1:11:07| But is it fair to say that you have been short several dozens of officers for years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4267.02)|
| 1:11:15| Not as bad as we are right now, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4275.02)|
| 1:11:19| Is it fair to say that you have been short several dozens of officers for the past several years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4279.02)|
| 1:11:26| No, I wouldn't say several dozens for the past several years, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4286.02)|
| 1:11:30| When I came into office, we may have had a total of maybe 25 to 30 vacancies or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4290.02)|
| 1:11:39| and that would include civilians as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4299.02)|
| 1:11:41| Okay, so it's about doubled then since you've been in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4301.02)|
| 1:11:44| It's probably doubled or tripled, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4304.02)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4308.02)|
| 1:11:53| Just because we're running, I mean, this is taking a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4313.02)|
| 1:11:58| but one thing I just would like to clarify with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4318.02)|
| 1:12:02| I'm actually one of the commissioners that is a member of the Pension and Retirement Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4322.02)|
| 1:12:08| and I was at that meeting on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4328.02)|
| 1:12:12| and I'm not real sure exactly what you heard or how you heard it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4332.02)|
| 1:12:18| or why you reacted the way that you did from what I heard you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4338.02)|
| 1:12:24| I mean, you made the statement that we were threatening to take benefits away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4344.02)|
| 1:12:37| and I will tell you I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4357.02)|
| 1:12:40| I spent over two hours talking about the what-ifs if a 30% pay raise was to be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4360.02)|
| 1:12:50| and never one time was there anything threatening said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4370.02)|
| 1:12:54| and never one time was there ever, ever an implication that anything that any sheriff's deputy has already earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4374.02)|
| 1:13:03| was going to be taken away, not ever, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4383.02)|
| 1:13:08| The charge of the Pensions and Retirements Board is to be sure that it remains fiscally sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4388.02)|
| 1:13:16| and that's not just for our sheriff's deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4396.02)|
| 1:13:18| That's for any employees that are members of the several retirement systems that fall under that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4398.02)|
| 1:13:26| and quite honestly, when you're faced as a fiscally responsible board with the thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4406.02)|
| 1:13:34| and the charge of figuring out where you're going to come up with $60 million over the next 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4414.02)|
| 1:13:44| if a certain scenario was to occur is something that is very justified in talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4424.02)|
| 1:13:53| and reasoning through and coming up with if this is what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4433.02)|
| 1:13:59| then what are some actions that we may need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4439.02)|
| 1:14:03| I really regret if you got the impression or the message that we were in any way threatening your officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4443.02)|
| 1:14:13| because I can assure you, sir, we were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4453.02)|
| 1:14:16| Well, I can appreciate that and thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4456.02)|
| 1:14:18| and I think when it was mentioned that a possibility of freezing the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4458.02)|
| 1:14:22| that may have been taken in a different light, if you will, to different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4462.02)|
| 1:14:27| but, you know, when you start talking about we've always heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4467.02)|
| 1:14:31| and I've always heard it as long as I've been in office, that the UOF is costing the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4471.02)|
| 1:14:37| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4477.02)|
| 1:14:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4478.02)|
| 1:14:39| I'm not blind to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4479.02)|
| 1:14:40| Our problem goes back to when the UOF was enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4480.02)|
| 1:14:46| and it had on the stipulation on the referendum that it could cost up to $0.08 property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4486.02)|
| 1:14:52| and commission back then decided not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4492.02)|
| 1:14:55| That's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4495.02)|
| 1:14:57| That's why we're in the predicament we're in today, because of that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4497.02)|
| 1:15:01| It may not be only that thing, but your point is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4501.02)|
| 1:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4507.02)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4508.02)|
| 1:15:09| And commissioners, and I'll leave you with this, just so you have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4509.02)|
| 1:15:12| I have 154 people right now that are eligible to retire at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4512.02)|
| 1:15:21| If they go out today, that kind of gives you an idea of where we are, even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4521.02)|
| 1:15:26| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4526.02)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4528.02)|
| 1:15:29| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4529.02)|
| 1:15:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4531.02)|
| 1:15:33| I want to first commend Sheriff Spangler for advocating on behalf of your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4533.02)|
| 1:15:39| I also want to commend our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4539.02)|
| 1:15:43| You know, I've had the great privilege and opportunity to call many of you friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4543.02)|
| 1:15:49| and also come to love dozens of you like family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4549.02)|
| 1:15:54| And I think Commissioner Oster said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4554.02)|
| 1:15:58| This has nothing to do with our level of respect or support or how we value you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4558.02)|
| 1:16:06| That's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4566.02)|
| 1:16:08| You've chosen to protect and to serve us, and we can't put a price on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4568.02)|
| 1:16:18| You're always owed immeasurably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4578.02)|
| 1:16:21| And so, this is a very difficult conversation, and it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4581.02)|
| 1:16:29| I'm kind of putting on my HR hat because I had another great opportunity to serve as an HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4589.02)|
| 1:16:36| So, I kind of understand and do sympathize with the challenges that we face right now in almost every industry with recruiting and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4596.02)|
| 1:16:48| This is a challenging discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4608.02)|
| 1:16:50| I mean, it's not cut and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4610.02)|
| 1:16:52| It's not cut and dry numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4612.02)|
| 1:16:54| There are so many factors that we have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4614.02)|
| 1:16:57| So, I mean, I'm just going to spend a little bit of time kind of going over those considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4617.02)|
| 1:17:02| and possibly asking questions that maybe my constituents would like answers, if we have answers, just because we have a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4622.02)|
| 1:17:12| And I want you all to see that, that we do have a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4632.02)|
| 1:17:16| I also understand the need and desire to compensate employees fairly and competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4636.02)|
| 1:17:22| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4642.02)|
| 1:17:24| I also understand the great importance of culture in a workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4644.02)|
| 1:17:29| creating an environment where employees feel valued and worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4649.02)|
| 1:17:34| In fact, every employee that I've had the great opportunity of working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4654.02)|
| 1:17:38| they've said many times that workplace environment and support is equally, if not even more important than pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4658.02)|
| 1:17:46| And it's finding that balance between compensation and quality of work life that's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4666.02)|
| 1:17:53| And again, there are so many factors that we have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4673.02)|
| 1:17:57| You have to consider cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4677.02)|
| 1:17:59| You have to consider market trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4679.02)|
| 1:18:01| You have to consider talent pools, inflation, state and local indicators, wage and hour regulations, benefit packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4681.02)|
| 1:18:09| employer services and programs, even organizational structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4689.02)|
| 1:18:13| Again, it's not a cut and dry numbers discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4693.02)|
| 1:18:17| We can't talk about salaries without talking about some of the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4697.02)|
| 1:18:25| So that's what I wanted to kind of start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4705.02)|
| 1:18:29| This is something that I did when I was an HR director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4709.02)|
| 1:18:32| and we were actually talking with individuals who were looking to move from outside of the county or outside of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4712.02)|
| 1:18:39| I would kind of give them just kind of a glimpse of a salary value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4719.02)|
| 1:18:44| And I did that with the patrol starting salary of 47.9 and looked at cost of living indexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4724.02)|
| 1:18:52| So if I had an employee coming from, let's say, Hamilton County, which is Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4732.02)|
| 1:18:58| they would need to make in Chattanooga 53.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4738.02)|
| 1:19:02| So the cost of living in Chattanooga is actually 11% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4742.02)|
| 1:19:06| Transportation is 2% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4746.02)|
| 1:19:08| Housing is 30% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4748.02)|
| 1:19:10| Food is 9% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4750.02)|
| 1:19:11| Entertainment is 6% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4751.02)|
| 1:19:13| And health care is 4% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4753.02)|
| 1:19:15| Shelby and Memphis, again, 3% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4755.02)|
| 1:19:19| They would need to make 49 versus the 47.9 here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4759.02)|
| 1:19:24| Housing is 11% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4764.02)|
| 1:19:26| Transportation is 1% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4766.02)|
| 1:19:28| Food 2% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4768.02)|
| 1:19:29| Entertainment 2% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4769.02)|
| 1:19:31| Health care was actually lower in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4771.02)|
| 1:19:35| Davidson, Nashville, 16% higher cost of living index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4775.02)|
| 1:19:41| The salary value there, 55.7 compared to 47.9 here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4781.02)|
| 1:19:48| Housing is 45% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4788.02)|
| 1:19:51| Transportation, 3% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4791.02)|
| 1:19:53| Food, 10% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4793.02)|
| 1:19:55| Entertainment, 11% higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4795.02)|
| 1:19:57| And health care was comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4797.02)|
| 1:20:00| So I wanted to put that out there because, again, those are a lot of, that's a piece of the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4800.02)|
| 1:20:07| Then also I had some questions about the applications that have been received over the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4807.02)|
| 1:20:15| It's noted that there were 372 applications received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4815.02)|
| 1:20:21| And we hired, or you hired, 113 of those applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4821.02)|
| 1:20:29| Can you give me any reasons of why the others were not hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4829.02)|
| 1:20:34| I mean, what did you see as far as trends in applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4834.02)|
| 1:20:38| That's a combination of several things, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4838.02)|
| 1:20:40| One, they either didn't pass the physical, they didn't pass drug screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4840.02)|
| 1:20:45| It could be multiple things such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4845.02)|
| 1:20:47| So psychological is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4847.02)|
| 1:20:49| And obviously I heard somebody, and they didn't come from this commission, so why don't we lower our standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4849.02)|
| 1:20:55| No, we're not lowering standards because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4855.02)|
| 1:20:59| And it's always been, at least before I left, let's put it that way, there's always been a pool to pick from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4859.02)|
| 1:21:08| So if we had 300 and some odd people in a hopper, so to speak, we don't have that hopper anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4868.02)|
| 1:21:17| We might have 20 people sitting there that want to come to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4877.02)|
| 1:21:21| So it's always something in there, but it could be a combination, like I said, psychological, medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4881.02)|
| 1:21:26| anything like that keeps it from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4886.02)|
| 1:21:28| And psychological is one of the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4888.02)|
| 1:21:32| So of the 113 that were hired, where were most of those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4892.02)|
| 1:21:37| Where were those individuals placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4897.02)|
| 1:21:39| Most of them would be corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4899.02)|
| 1:21:41| Corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4901.02)|
| 1:21:46| Getting through all my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4906.02)|
| 1:21:49| So the total budget we discussed is $101 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4909.02)|
| 1:21:53| Payroll is over half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4913.02)|
| 1:21:55| That's an increase of $59 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4915.02)|
| 1:21:58| So where is that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4918.02)|
| 1:22:00| The additional $5.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4920.02)|
| 1:22:07| The bulk of that, almost $6 million, would go for those raises that the mayor has proposed, the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4927.02)|
| 1:22:13| That's for the bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4933.02)|
| 1:22:14| There's a small increase in corrections for pharmacy, drugs, food, a small, and then his overtime budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4934.02)|
| 1:22:22| There's been an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4942.02)|
| 1:22:23| Then the other question I have is every other ask of the department or the office, their requests were met in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4943.02)|
| 1:22:32| correct, outside of the 30% salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4952.02)|
| 1:22:36| We did not turn in a budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4956.02)|
| 1:22:39| The only thing we turned in was salary increases and capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4959.02)|
| 1:22:42| That's what we were asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4962.02)|
| 1:22:44| The capital outlay, which many people, citizens, I've had this conversation over the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4964.02)|
| 1:22:51| they did not realize that any capital outlay does not come out of the sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4971.02)|
| 1:22:56| It actually comes out of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4976.02)|
| 1:22:58| And that's right at $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4978.02)|
| 1:23:01| Are there any of those capital outlays that the office would be willing to forego?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4981.02)|
| 1:23:07| The $3 million includes 47 vehicles where the bulk of those go to patrol, law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4987.02)|
| 1:23:15| The other is the body cams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4995.02)|
| 1:23:16| It's $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4996.02)|
| 1:23:17| We cannot cut that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4997.02)|
| 1:23:21| And then talk to me a little bit about the Drug Task Force Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5001.02)|
| 1:23:25| On average, it's around, what, $700,000, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5005.02)|
| 1:23:31| What can that money be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5011.02)|
| 1:23:33| If you're talking about the state drug fund, which is funded from the seizures, the forfeitures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5013.02)|
| 1:23:40| that money can be spent on law enforcement purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5020.02)|
| 1:23:46| It's used to buy narcotics vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5026.02)|
| 1:23:48| It's used for confidential buy money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5028.02)|
| 1:23:49| It's used for aviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5029.02)|
| 1:23:51| Those are the three main uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5031.02)|
| 1:23:53| So could it be used for salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5033.02)|
| 1:23:55| No salaries, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5035.02)|
| 1:23:56| No salaries, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5036.02)|
| 1:23:58| And then I think Commissioner Schoonmaker asked about the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5038.02)|
| 1:24:02| So, again, putting on my HR hat, I'm not even sure that we should even be considering any proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5042.02)|
| 1:24:11| without a third-party salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5051.02)|
| 1:24:15| I just think that's a critical piece of information that we just don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5055.02)|
| 1:24:19| And right now it's kind of our perspective versus your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5059.02)|
| 1:24:25| And, you know, I would really like to see a comprehensive salary study conducted before we do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5065.02)|
| 1:24:37| You know, I also want to comment on, you know, Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5077.02)|
| 1:24:40| I understand that you stated that we have the authority to raise these salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5080.02)|
| 1:24:45| but you also have the authority to raise those salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5085.02)|
| 1:24:48| You have the authority to write and amend job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5088.02)|
| 1:24:52| You have the authority to set salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5092.02)|
| 1:24:54| It goes before merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5094.02)|
| 1:24:56| That's why we have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5096.02)|
| 1:24:58| And so I kind of see you like the CEO of the organization, and I'm an investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5098.02)|
| 1:25:04| And so I'm looking to you to identify what is your most valued asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5104.02)|
| 1:25:10| And if you are identifying your most valuable asset as your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5110.02)|
| 1:25:15| then I would want to see your budget tailored to demonstrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5115.02)|
| 1:25:23| And that's something that I would actually tell my department heads and leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5123.02)|
| 1:25:30| when I was helping them identify budgets when they were going through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5130.02)|
| 1:25:35| And I did hear you state that you don't think the citizens would have heartburn over a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5135.02)|
| 1:25:42| You know, that's something that I think there needs to be some polling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5142.02)|
| 1:25:48| I don't think we should be deciding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5148.02)|
| 1:25:52| I think citizens should have the opportunity to have a say if they would support a property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5152.02)|
| 1:25:58| and I think that citizens should also have a say as to where that money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5158.02)|
| 1:26:05| Because we've got roads, schools, parks, teachers, public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5165.02)|
| 1:26:10| We've got a lot of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5170.02)|
| 1:26:13| You know, and I worry about property tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5173.02)|
| 1:26:17| I know that you made an example that it was kind of minimal, but it does impact our officers' home finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5177.02)|
| 1:26:24| It does impact our teachers' home finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5184.02)|
| 1:26:27| It does impact our farmers' home finances and our county employees' too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5187.02)|
| 1:26:38| I think what's also difficult for me with putting my personnel hat on is that I worry that we're making a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5198.02)|
| 1:26:50| that one set of skilled employees deserve more of a raise than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5210.02)|
| 1:27:01| And I also worry about the precedent that it will set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5221.02)|
| 1:27:08| I also worry about a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5228.02)|
| 1:27:20| I'm deeply concerned about that, and I'm really disappointed that we're even having that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5240.02)|
| 1:27:26| I don't want to see our taxpayers spend half a million to a million dollars on litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5246.02)|
| 1:27:33| when it's something that we could be putting back into all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5253.02)|
| 1:27:40| It's really concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5260.02)|
| 1:27:48| We now have a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5268.02)|
| 1:27:54| Have you worked with the FOP on a proposal at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5274.02)|
| 1:27:58| Have you spoken to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5278.02)|
| 1:28:00| I know we received the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5280.02)|
| 1:28:02| It was very general, very vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5282.02)|
| 1:28:07| Have they offered to work with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5287.02)|
| 1:28:10| I know that that's really what they do is try to speak on behalf of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5290.02)|
| 1:28:16| and advocate and be a champion for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5296.02)|
| 1:28:19| I haven't really heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5299.02)|
| 1:28:21| Other than that letter, and then, of course, we have a young lady sitting here that is a member of the FOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5301.02)|
| 1:28:27| or at least on the executive board, but they're there as a support team as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5307.02)|
| 1:28:32| just like they would be for any other law enforcement agency here in the local area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5312.02)|
| 1:28:37| I would like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5317.02)|
| 1:28:41| I reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5321.02)|
| 1:28:42| They said I would get a letter, so I got the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5322.02)|
| 1:28:44| Again, it was very vague and just kind of general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5324.02)|
| 1:28:48| You did talk about assessing staff levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5328.02)|
| 1:28:51| That's always very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5331.02)|
| 1:28:53| I would really love to see how you assess staff levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5333.02)|
| 1:28:55| and I know you mentioned that you'll provide that report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5335.02)|
| 1:28:59| The funding for the positions that are open, there have been some open positions for over a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5339.02)|
| 1:29:04| Where has that funding gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5344.02)|
| 1:29:07| Where has that funding gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5347.02)|
| 1:29:08| Yeah, where is that funding that was set aside for salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5348.02)|
| 1:29:12| It goes back in to the general fund, and it's still there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5352.02)|
| 1:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5355.02)|
| 1:29:17| I also want to commend Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5357.02)|
| 1:29:19| I'm not sure if he's here, but I kind of went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5359.02)|
| 1:29:22| and looked over salary increases over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5362.02)|
| 1:29:26| and this is actually the largest pay raise that's ever been offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5366.02)|
| 1:29:30| should the 8% be adopted into this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5370.02)|
| 1:29:35| That was important to me, just to look at the 20-year trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5375.02)|
| 1:29:40| because that's in my training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5380.02)|
| 1:29:44| Can you talk to me a little bit about the benefits in detail that the officers receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5384.02)|
| 1:29:54| The benefits are basically the county benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5394.02)|
| 1:29:57| They have their 401K or their pension or their STAR, depending on what plan they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5397.02)|
| 1:30:03| Of course, the UOP closed in 2014, so now it's STAR or 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5403.02)|
| 1:30:08| They've got the medical insurance, the dental, vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5408.02)|
| 1:30:13| I mean, just the typical benefits that the county employee has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5413.02)|
| 1:30:17| Are there any plans to improve those benefits, like any continuing education or certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5417.02)|
| 1:30:25| The sheriff has continuously tried to do the education benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5425.02)|
| 1:30:29| We have looked at other—of course, it all costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5429.02)|
| 1:30:32| We're going to run into the same issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5432.02)|
| 1:30:35| that anything that he would like to try to do is going to cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5435.02)|
| 1:30:40| I took a look, too, at the Join KCESO website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5440.02)|
| 1:30:47| I know that was something that you all put out there kind of as a recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5447.02)|
| 1:30:53| I found it interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5453.02)|
| 1:30:54| I didn't see a way to actually apply or to submit an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5454.02)|
| 1:30:58| or to submit a resume or pass certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5458.02)|
| 1:31:02| It basically stated you fill out an inquiry form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5462.02)|
| 1:31:06| and it asks for name, phone number, email, and tell us about yourself and your interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5466.02)|
| 1:31:12| As a former HR director, I'm not sure that's a useful way to attract talent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5472.02)|
| 1:31:17| simply because you're not asking for credentials or experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5477.02)|
| 1:31:22| That's an open-ended question that's very subjective, and that's kind of a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5482.02)|
| 1:31:29| So just as a statement, I think you can expand on that recruitment tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5489.02)|
| 1:31:36| and that's just my macro-level first glance at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5496.02)|
| 1:31:41| Let me let Captain Aaron Yarnell real briefly explain that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5501.02)|
| 1:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5504.02)|
| 1:31:47| Aaron Yarnell, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5507.02)|
| 1:31:49| I noticed he said briefly, so I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5509.02)|
| 1:31:54| I don't know you ever to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5514.02)|
| 1:31:56| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5516.02)|
| 1:31:58| Our thought process was to get possible recruits in contact with current officers, detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5518.02)|
| 1:32:05| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5525.02)|
| 1:32:07| That way they're not having to speak with a personnel division sitting at a desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5527.02)|
| 1:32:11| They're actually talking to the people that they're going to be doing the job with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5531.02)|
| 1:32:14| To do that, we added this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5534.02)|
| 1:32:18| The same process as before, they can still do the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5538.02)|
| 1:32:22| They can still go to Knox County's website, look at the positions, apply the exact same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5542.02)|
| 1:32:26| This was just an initiative to help people get in contact with people that they're going to be talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5546.02)|
| 1:32:31| and working beside of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5551.02)|
| 1:32:33| What you don't see is when they fill out a form out, we assign a mentor recruiter to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5553.02)|
| 1:32:39| who contacts them within 24 hours to introduce themselves, also gives them a link to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5559.02)|
| 1:32:46| That's where everything you're talking about comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5566.02)|
| 1:32:49| It's not there on the website, but that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5569.02)|
| 1:32:53| I would like to see a link added to the website where it was a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5573.02)|
| 1:32:58| I think it's a great idea as far as mentoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5578.02)|
| 1:33:02| How do you select the officers who are the mentors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5582.02)|
| 1:33:06| We basically sent an email out and asked if anyone was interested in assisting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5586.02)|
| 1:33:10| because we didn't have, obviously, money to pay any extra for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5590.02)|
| 1:33:15| other than the normal bonuses that could be received for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5595.02)|
| 1:33:18| So it's voluntary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5598.02)|
| 1:33:19| Yes, correct. So just a volunteer basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5599.02)|
| 1:33:22| How much have you spent on recruitment, let's say, over the last 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5602.02)|
| 1:33:29| Last year we put in around $60,000 for our recruitment budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5609.02)|
| 1:33:34| The sheriff has instituted a bonus if an employee refers someone who is hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5614.02)|
| 1:33:40| He has done that for the current employees. They receive a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5620.02)|
| 1:33:49| Let's see. I'm just kind of looking through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5629.02)|
| 1:33:58| How many corrections officers are needed for the accreditation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5638.02)|
| 1:34:10| I'm Chief William Purvis with the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5650.02)|
| 1:34:13| I'm the Chief of Corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5653.02)|
| 1:34:15| Our accreditation isn't really based on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5655.02)|
| 1:34:19| We have a number of positions that have to be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5659.02)|
| 1:34:23| When it comes to our certification, we're expected to have the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5663.02)|
| 1:34:29| that are adequate to the task at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5669.02)|
| 1:34:32| As probably has already been mentioned about our Prison Rape Elimination Act numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5672.02)|
| 1:34:38| That is the bare bones minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5678.02)|
| 1:34:41| That was done in cooperation as the auditors were looking at our current position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5681.02)|
| 1:34:47| or the number of individuals that's required to safely run our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5687.02)|
| 1:34:54| They came up with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5694.02)|
| 1:34:56| That number is very important to us because it covers all your key positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5696.02)|
| 1:35:02| It makes sure that the inmates are safe. It makes sure that the officers are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5702.02)|
| 1:35:07| That's our most significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5707.02)|
| 1:35:10| When we drop below that, that is our major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5710.02)|
| 1:35:14| That is adjusted per shift, per areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5714.02)|
| 1:35:21| It's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5721.02)|
| 1:35:24| It's a moving number as far as giving you a static number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5724.02)|
| 1:35:29| It's based on those positions, not just the number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5729.02)|
| 1:35:34| but positions that have to be filled during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5734.02)|
| 1:35:38| Currently, we are dropping below that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5738.02)|
| 1:35:43| The sheriff has been able to take some of the money from the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5743.02)|
| 1:35:47| that were unable to fill and provide with overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5747.02)|
| 1:35:51| which our staff has been working in those overtime positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5751.02)|
| 1:35:55| We're still not able to get enough individuals to fill those positions for that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5755.02)|
| 1:36:01| Still, while you're there, Chief Purvis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5761.02)|
| 1:36:05| I know that you had stated a previous time that you were before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5765.02)|
| 1:36:08| that staffing the jail was an ongoing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5768.02)|
| 1:36:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5772.02)|
| 1:36:13| I guess I'm still confused as to why then 50 or so of those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5773.02)|
| 1:36:19| that were offered up were from corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5779.02)|
| 1:36:22| If you have any insight to clarify that for me, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5782.02)|
| 1:36:28| I think the reason that the positions were being given up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5788.02)|
| 1:36:32| we're currently unable to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5792.02)|
| 1:36:34| We've had a mean average of around 90 positions this year that we haven't been able to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5794.02)|
| 1:36:40| Just being able to offer a salary that would allow for getting an additional 40 individuals in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5800.02)|
| 1:36:47| would be a great impact for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5807.02)|
| 1:36:50| So we're looking for any measure that we can do to possibly get more individuals into these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5810.02)|
| 1:36:58| As you all well know, the corrections division is not a glamorous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5818.02)|
| 1:37:02| It's dealing with some of the most difficult people that our society has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5822.02)|
| 1:37:07| The challenges and the risk of injury almost on a very regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5827.02)|
| 1:37:14| we're dealing with officers who are injured in the line of doing the daily job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5834.02)|
| 1:37:20| So many of them decide that there are safer places to go with more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5840.02)|
| 1:37:29| We lose some of our individuals to even the fast food industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5849.02)|
| 1:37:33| So it's just another effort to try to get more of a salary to attract employees into that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5853.02)|
| 1:37:43| Do you all do exit interviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5863.02)|
| 1:37:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5865.02)|
| 1:37:46| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5866.02)|
| 1:37:47| Are those something that you would be willing to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5867.02)|
| 1:37:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5874.02)|
| 1:37:55| And I just say that because I had reached out to several that I know had left the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5875.02)|
| 1:38:01| whether in the last year to two years, and just asked a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5881.02)|
| 1:38:06| and pay was not one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5886.02)|
| 1:38:10| And I was just surprised by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5890.02)|
| 1:38:14| So I would be interested in seeing those exit interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5894.02)|
| 1:38:19| and seeing what kind of justification there is for recruitment, retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5899.02)|
| 1:38:26| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5906.02)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5908.02)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5909.02)|
| 1:38:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5910.02)|
| 1:38:32| Thank you, Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5912.02)|
| 1:38:33| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5913.02)|
| 1:38:35| Good evening, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5915.02)|
| 1:38:37| We're almost two hours into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5917.02)|
| 1:38:39| I'll try to be as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5919.02)|
| 1:38:43| You and I have a fairly good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5923.02)|
| 1:38:44| We have a lot of private conversations about this over the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5924.02)|
| 1:38:49| For me, this is an interesting, complex situation in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5929.02)|
| 1:38:57| As a fiscal conservative, it's never any fun to be a fiscal conservative, right, because I hate taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5937.02)|
| 1:39:01| I don't want to raise taxes, and, you know, we always have to be like the tough guys up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5941.02)|
| 1:39:08| But as a guy that's served in combat, the video is terrible, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5948.02)|
| 1:39:14| but the radio call just reminds me of the radio calls that, you know, you get in Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5954.02)|
| 1:39:19| And I remember it just took me to a place where my friend got killed in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5959.02)|
| 1:39:24| I remember the call that he went down, and, you know, it's going to be tough to sleep tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5964.02)|
| 1:39:28| And, you know, it's one of the things that gets lost in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5968.02)|
| 1:39:32| that you guys put your life on the line every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5972.02)|
| 1:39:36| That's why you guys should get paid more, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5976.02)|
| 1:39:38| Because not to say these other jobs that other public people, you know, employees do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5978.02)|
| 1:39:43| but, you know, being a cop and deciding to go in there and take a bullet is not an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5983.02)|
| 1:39:49| There's a reason why when you go to combat, you get combat pay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5989.02)|
| 1:39:52| When you're on the, you know, state side, you don't get paid as much as when you're down range getting shot at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5992.02)|
| 1:39:57| And not for nothing, you know, this is a great place to live, but you guys decide to go down range every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5997.02)|
| 1:40:03| You put that shield on and put that uniform on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6003.02)|
| 1:40:06| It's not an easy decision to make, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6006.02)|
| 1:40:11| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6011.02)|
| 1:40:13| It's tough saying goodbye to the kids and the family in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6013.02)|
| 1:40:15| and not knowing if you're going to walk in that door later on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6015.02)|
| 1:40:19| So first off, I want to say that to all the men and women that are here that hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6019.02)|
| 1:40:24| So I just wanted to let you know that I feel for your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6024.02)|
| 1:40:28| I lost a piece of ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6028.02)|
| 1:40:30| That's all I left in Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6030.02)|
| 1:40:31| Luckily, I didn't lose any arms or limbs or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6031.02)|
| 1:40:36| Secondly, I'm a CEO of a fairly large company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6036.02)|
| 1:40:39| We service 60,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6039.02)|
| 1:40:41| It is tough being the boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6041.02)|
| 1:40:44| Hiring people is not fun, especially these last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6044.02)|
| 1:40:47| Retaining people is not fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6047.02)|
| 1:40:48| I'm sure if you would look at the guys that I've had to fire that have left my company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6048.02)|
| 1:40:52| they probably wouldn't say the greatest things either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6052.02)|
| 1:40:54| But I know the ones that I've kept, you know, part of the reason they stay is because we take very good care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6054.02)|
| 1:41:00| I'm very proud that I pay well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6060.02)|
| 1:41:03| I pay better than most of your starting guys get paid, and they get full benefits with my company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6063.02)|
| 1:41:09| It's always an argument that I take is, you know, I know I'm in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6069.02)|
| 1:41:14| but my guys aren't getting shot at every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6074.02)|
| 1:41:16| They might get a little bit dirty, but that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6076.02)|
| 1:41:19| So I wanted to say that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6079.02)|
| 1:41:22| And I'm a numbers guy, and as politicians, we're good at talking out of both sides of our mouths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6082.02)|
| 1:41:28| because we make one argument about, you know, inflation and how expensive it is to live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6088.02)|
| 1:41:35| and the medium house income and everything else, and then the other side, we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6095.02)|
| 1:41:39| oh, we can't really give you too much more money because of reason A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6099.02)|
| 1:41:43| You know, we unfortunately are the body that has to do the balancing act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6103.02)|
| 1:41:47| and I don't know how you survive and buy a house here in this day and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6107.02)|
| 1:41:52| My wife and I had this conversation over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6112.02)|
| 1:41:55| We're very fortunate we have two good jobs, and at the time we bought a $280,000 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6115.02)|
| 1:42:03| That $280,000 house with taxes and insurance was $1,500 payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6123.02)|
| 1:42:08| If I bought the same $280,000 house just with the inflationary rate and the interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6128.02)|
| 1:42:15| it would be $2,400 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6135.02)|
| 1:42:18| I couldn't afford that house just with the interest rate alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6138.02)|
| 1:42:20| That house today is not worth $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6140.02)|
| 1:42:23| With the interest rate, it would be a pipe dream for us to own something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6143.02)|
| 1:42:28| So it's hard to, you know, tell your employees that want to live here and work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6148.02)|
| 1:42:35| and some of them probably were raised here, and they want to raise their kids here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6155.02)|
| 1:42:39| hey, you know, I know you guys got to buy the $260,000 house at 3% interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6159.02)|
| 1:42:45| but now, five years later, you know, sorry kids, we're going to have to move a county over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6165.02)|
| 1:42:51| and Dad's going to have to drive 45 minutes to work and, you know, 45 minutes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6171.02)|
| 1:42:55| So that's an hour every day less you have to spend with your kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6175.02)|
| 1:42:58| And being a new father, you know, every minute that you have to spend with your child is a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6178.02)|
| 1:43:02| So, you know, privately, and I don't mind saying this out in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6182.02)|
| 1:43:06| I think, Jesse, you didn't even have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6186.02)|
| 1:43:09| I'm good with, like, 10%, 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6189.02)|
| 1:43:11| That was where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6191.02)|
| 1:43:13| You and I talked about this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6193.02)|
| 1:43:14| I'm not saying anything that you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6194.02)|
| 1:43:16| 30% is tough for me personally to swallow because it's going to take on a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6196.02)|
| 1:43:24| and I don't really have a tolerance for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6204.02)|
| 1:43:27| So you and I have had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6207.02)|
| 1:43:30| You know where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6210.02)|
| 1:43:31| I want everybody else to know where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6211.02)|
| 1:43:32| That's kind of where my mentality was going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6212.02)|
| 1:43:35| and I think you and I had this conversation like that $50,000 threshold is a really important one to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6215.02)|
| 1:43:40| especially when it comes to hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6220.02)|
| 1:43:42| That's why you saw the state say teachers need to be at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6222.02)|
| 1:43:45| That's why they say, you know, state prisons need to be up at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6225.02)|
| 1:43:49| That's an important number, and that's kind of the number internally that I was looking at getting you guys to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6229.02)|
| 1:43:54| for starting salaries for patrol guys is trying to get to that $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6234.02)|
| 1:43:58| I really don't care what anybody else pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6238.02)|
| 1:44:00| I kind of have your mentality, like, I want the best, and I want to be the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6240.02)|
| 1:44:03| and if this is what I need to be, it's tough recruiting to be cops these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6243.02)|
| 1:44:07| especially with the national temperature on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6247.02)|
| 1:44:10| So I really don't want to see a lawsuit either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6250.02)|
| 1:44:13| I hate wasting taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6253.02)|
| 1:44:15| You know, if you want to, like, I'm a negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6255.02)|
| 1:44:19| I love debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6259.02)|
| 1:44:20| You know, I'll be even willing to sit in and help, you know, bring people to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6260.02)|
| 1:44:25| It's, you know, 30 over three years, 30 over four years or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6265.02)|
| 1:44:29| More negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6269.02)|
| 1:44:30| Is that impossible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6270.02)|
| 1:44:31| I don't know the numbers like Mr. Caldwell does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6271.02)|
| 1:44:33| Like, I don't know what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6273.02)|
| 1:44:35| You know, do we need to get rid of all the libraries to make more room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6275.02)|
| 1:44:38| Like, sure, the library is on your phone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6278.02)|
| 1:44:40| I don't care about libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6280.02)|
| 1:44:41| I'm a millennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6281.02)|
| 1:44:42| We don't go to libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6282.02)|
| 1:44:44| So that doesn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6284.02)|
| 1:44:45| I can find $7 million right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6285.02)|
| 1:44:47| But you get the point that I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6287.02)|
| 1:44:49| I'm willing to find a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6289.02)|
| 1:44:53| I don't know if it's 30, but I'm willing to try to find a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6293.02)|
| 1:44:56| If you guys can negotiate a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6296.02)|
| 1:44:59| It's really hard for me to pallet 30 is a very large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6299.02)|
| 1:45:04| And I'm also, I didn't make that Friday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6304.02)|
| 1:45:06| I wasn't in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6306.02)|
| 1:45:07| But, you know, it's not just, it's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6307.02)|
| 1:45:11| It's very cumulative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6311.02)|
| 1:45:13| And then there's the after effect of, all right, what are, it goes downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6313.02)|
| 1:45:18| creates a snowball effect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6318.02)|
| 1:45:20| So I don't know if 30 this year is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6320.02)|
| 1:45:24| I hope we get to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6324.02)|
| 1:45:26| That's, you know, eight is the biggest in county history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6326.02)|
| 1:45:29| I think that's a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6329.02)|
| 1:45:32| Is there a path forward to get more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6332.02)|
| 1:45:34| Because I do like to get the starting salary up to 50,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6334.02)|
| 1:45:37| I think is the right number, regardless of what the city pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6337.02)|
| 1:45:41| I think, you know, it's a good comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6341.02)|
| 1:45:44| Like, I always want to be a dollar more than the city, always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6344.02)|
| 1:45:48| because I want to be able to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6348.02)|
| 1:45:51| And that's who you're recruiting against at your competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6351.02)|
| 1:45:54| So common sense says, well, we need to be at least more than the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6354.02)|
| 1:45:59| And we also have a whole jail to fill up as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6359.02)|
| 1:46:02| not just police officers on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6362.02)|
| 1:46:04| So it's not a singular argument when it comes to the city either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6364.02)|
| 1:46:09| So that's kind of where my mind's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6369.02)|
| 1:46:12| Being top four, top five in the state is kind of a number that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6372.02)|
| 1:46:18| comfortable with considering the size of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6378.02)|
| 1:46:21| I don't know where those numbers that Ms. Frazier came with or what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6381.02)|
| 1:46:25| data set is or how long ago that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6385.02)|
| 1:46:27| But if you look at all the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6387.02)|
| 1:46:29| we're probably around the fifth most expensive county to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6389.02)|
| 1:46:32| So if we're around five, that's palatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6392.02)|
| 1:46:36| I'd like to be higher, more of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6396.02)|
| 1:46:38| I like to be one because I'm competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6398.02)|
| 1:46:40| But, you know, top five, I think, is a palatable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6400.02)|
| 1:46:43| So these are just my personal thoughts out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6403.02)|
| 1:46:46| So I'm willing to work and help any way that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6406.02)|
| 1:46:51| And I just want to be on the record and let everybody know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6411.02)|
| 1:46:54| So that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6414.02)|
| 1:46:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6417.02)|
| 1:46:58| And Commissioner Oster, I don't look at myself as being a CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6418.02)|
| 1:47:04| but I guess that's kind of the position I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6424.02)|
| 1:47:06| But with that being said, as I told the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6426.02)|
| 1:47:10| the mayor and I are good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6430.02)|
| 1:47:12| And I'm sure we'll continue to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6432.02)|
| 1:47:16| As I've told him, this is not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6436.02)|
| 1:47:19| It's not personal with any of you all up there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6439.02)|
| 1:47:22| It's just business for us to be able to, as you said, to run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6442.02)|
| 1:47:26| Yeah, that's what you're elected to do is run a $100 million company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6446.02)|
| 1:47:31| And I know it's tough sometimes for people to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6451.02)|
| 1:47:34| but you're not just making policing decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6454.02)|
| 1:47:37| You're making business decisions every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6457.02)|
| 1:47:39| and how to utilize taxpayer dollars to the best of its ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6459.02)|
| 1:47:42| Sometimes that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6462.02)|
| 1:47:44| And in the same aspect, we're the board of executives for these companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6464.02)|
| 1:47:49| for every individual company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6469.02)|
| 1:47:51| And we have to be responsible as well to the shareholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6471.02)|
| 1:47:55| And the shareholders in this sense, I love business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6475.02)|
| 1:47:57| so it doesn't mind me using these analogies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6477.02)|
| 1:47:59| but the shareholders are our county citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6479.02)|
| 1:48:01| So I can't screw over my shareholders just because my CEO wants A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6481.02)|
| 1:48:06| But at the same time, you can put a better product on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6486.02)|
| 1:48:09| if we give you more capital for certain endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6489.02)|
| 1:48:12| than I want to give you as much capital so we do as good a job as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6492.02)|
| 1:48:15| because also the board of directors are supposed to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6495.02)|
| 1:48:18| the company runs as smoothly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6498.02)|
| 1:48:20| and at its top efficiency and production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6500.02)|
| 1:48:23| So I just want to say I think you've been doing a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6503.02)|
| 1:48:28| and I hope to continue working together down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6508.02)|
| 1:48:31| my 15 months I have left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6511.02)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6514.02)|
| 1:48:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6515.02)|
| 1:48:37| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6517.02)|
| 1:48:38| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6518.02)|
| 1:48:39| Thank you, Madam Chair, to ask just the final comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6519.02)|
| 1:48:45| Ms. Rogers, when we were talking about the salary contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6525.02)|
| 1:48:51| that you guys had with the consultant and the deliverables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6531.02)|
| 1:48:55| he only got two deliverables out of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6535.02)|
| 1:48:58| Could you forward me the two deliverables that he sent to you guys then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6538.02)|
| 1:49:02| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6542.02)|
| 1:49:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6543.02)|
| 1:49:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6549.02)|
| 1:49:10| I have a question, but I think it might be for Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6550.02)|
| 1:49:14| It's about the UOP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6554.02)|
| 1:49:26| Director Caldwell, a big portion is, as we've mentioned, UOP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6566.02)|
| 1:49:31| Why is it so high now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6571.02)|
| 1:49:34| Is that because when it was instated in, I think, 2007 or 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6574.02)|
| 1:49:40| because commission did not do a tax increase then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6580.02)|
| 1:49:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6584.02)|
| 1:49:46| So the commission in 2007 or 2008 chose not to raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6586.02)|
| 1:49:50| as the sheriff mentioned, eight cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6590.02)|
| 1:49:52| But what should be pointed out, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6592.02)|
| 1:49:58| is that what commission did instead was issued a $57 million bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6598.02)|
| 1:50:03| taxable bond, to actuarially fund the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6603.02)|
| 1:50:10| We still have four more years left to pay on that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6610.02)|
| 1:50:18| We did refund it in 2014 to get a little better interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6618.02)|
| 1:50:24| So I think ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6624.02)|
| 1:50:28| even if commission would have raised taxes and not issued that bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6628.02)|
| 1:50:33| I think our contributions today would still be high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6633.02)|
| 1:50:36| because what's ended up happening is our discount rate has been lowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6636.02)|
| 1:50:40| from 7.5 down to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6640.02)|
| 1:50:43| partly because the state is lowering their discount rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6643.02)|
| 1:50:48| Mortality rate is better than anticipated when this plan was started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6648.02)|
| 1:50:53| Salaries, increases have been higher than what had been anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6653.02)|
| 1:50:58| People are retiring sooner, which has an impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6658.02)|
| 1:51:01| And so just to give you an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6661.02)|
| 1:51:04| our contribution to UOP this year, as you are well aware, is $10.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6664.02)|
| 1:51:10| What we don't count even toward UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6670.02)|
| 1:51:14| that bond payment that we're going to make in FY24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6674.02)|
| 1:51:18| principal and interest, is $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6678.02)|
| 1:51:21| So that's over and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6681.02)|
| 1:51:24| That went in to fund UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6684.02)|
| 1:51:26| and we don't count that as an expense towards UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6686.02)|
| 1:51:30| We pay that through debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6690.02)|
| 1:51:32| That debt will be done in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6692.02)|
| 1:51:36| But I think our contribution towards UOP would still be as high as it is today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6696.02)|
| 1:51:41| if taxes would have been raised, because you wouldn't have issued those bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6701.02)|
| 1:51:45| And so it's apples and oranges, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6705.02)|
| 1:51:49| That county commission could have done is to raise taxes to pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6709.02)|
| 1:51:55| but then that bond wouldn't have got issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6715.02)|
| 1:51:57| So it would still be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6717.02)|
| 1:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6720.02)|
| 1:52:03| Commissioners, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6723.02)|
| 1:52:06| Madam Chair, ma'am, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6726.02)|
| 1:52:09| Chief Debbie Cox, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6729.02)|
| 1:52:12| She's also one of the executive board members on the FOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6732.02)|
| 1:52:15| so I'll just give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6735.02)|
| 1:52:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6737.02)|

| 2:08:52| So that was one kind of where it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7732.46)|
| 2:08:56| So that's a win if you're an owner of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7736.900000000001)|
| 2:09:02| My understanding is that the staff was looking at the ordinance, the zoning for CA and CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7742.02)|
| 2:09:07| and they were talking with development staff and they realized that drive-thrus were a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7747.500000000001)|
| 2:09:12| use that was being permitted basically as an accessory or an ancillary use to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7752.700000000001)|
| 2:09:19| things that were permitted in CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7759.540000000001)|
| 2:09:21| Like if you have a restaurant, they would say, yep, a drive-thru is part of a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7761.26)|
| 2:09:26| so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7766.58)|
| 2:09:27| Or if you have a bank that's in CA, then yeah, you can have your bank teller lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7767.58)|
| 2:09:32| Other zones, so CA and CB are kind of silent on drive-thrus right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7772.34)|
| 2:09:37| Other zones, they look at drive-thrus, particularly CN and CR, and they say, well, a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7777.82)|
| 2:09:43| is a use on review, so there are some standards that kind of apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7783.38)|
| 2:09:51| So they said, well, we probably need to have standards for drive-thrus and actually address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7791.5)|
| 2:09:57| when a drive-thru is and isn't allowed and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7797.02)|
| 2:09:59| So that's what there's a lot of the zoning ordinance wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7799.18)|
| 2:10:05| So the reason that you have standards for drive-thrus is that they're designed to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7805.18)|
| 2:10:11| eliminate undesirable pollution that crosses lot boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7811.06)|
| 2:10:17| Drive-thrus especially, they can generate a lot of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7817.94)|
| 2:10:20| They can generate light and odors, and a property owner has, they have rights to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7820.9400000000005)|
| 2:10:28| to engage and do those uses on their property, but when that crosses that property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7828.460000000001)|
| 2:10:34| that then becomes pollution and detrimental to your adjacent property owners, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7834.22)|
| 2:10:38| a lot of the reason we have regulations and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7838.18)|
| 2:10:42| Planning staff, they did, KCPA, we think they did a thorough and outstanding job researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7842.580000000001)|
| 2:10:49| and drafting some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7849.1)|
| 2:10:50| They really brought their A-game to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7850.46)|
| 2:10:52| They looked at a lot of other places and research, and this has been, they spent several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7852.38)|
| 2:10:59| drafting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7859.38)|
| 2:11:00| It was on the agenda for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7860.38)|
| 2:11:03| But for us in Knox County, the reason that we have standards, or we need standards, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7863.54)|
| 2:11:09| standards are kind of on the floor and nonexistent, and we're asking to raise them to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7869.86)|
| 2:11:14| these pollution issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7874.54)|
| 2:11:18| As an example, I want you to look at, think about a couple of food city stores you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7878.3)|
| 2:11:21| think of in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7881.9400000000005)|
| 2:11:23| Some are developed in zones that might be shopping center or PC, and those have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7883.74)|
| 2:11:27| more landscaping and stuff around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7887.54)|
| 2:11:29| But I noticed in Hardin Valley, right in the heart, Hardin Valley and Steel Road, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7889.820000000001)|
| 2:11:34| a food city, and I looked, and that one's developed to the CA zone, which has no landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7894.3)|
| 2:11:38| standard, and that food city has not a single bit of landscaping anywhere on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7898.900000000001)|
| 2:11:45| All they have is grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7905.22)|
| 2:11:47| And the reason that you have standards is some developers do really great jobs and they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7907.02)|
| 2:11:51| add stuff even if it's not needed, others, they'll do what's required and only what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7911.620000000001)|
| 2:11:57| required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7917.06)|
| 2:11:58| So, you know, this proposal, it tries to lay out some good standards to follow to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7918.06)|
| 2:12:04| mitigate that pollution and friction that happens when you have a drive-through next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7924.900000000001)|
| 2:12:09| to a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7929.02)|
| 2:12:10| And that property, it could be, you know, single family residential, it could be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7930.02)|
| 2:12:14| apartment complex and, you know, people that live in apartments and you've got a lot popping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7934.46)|
| 2:12:18| up, they deserve to not have excessive noise or light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7938.34)|
| 2:12:21| You could have two commercial lots right next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7941.9)|
| 2:12:24| One develops initially as a sit-down restaurant and they've got a really nice seating area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7944.54)|
| 2:12:30| on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7950.9)|
| 2:12:32| Next to it, you have another CA property and they, 24-hour, you know, a national chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7952.1)|
| 2:12:36| with a 24-hour drive-through comes in and that drive-through goes on the side next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7956.62)|
| 2:12:40| the seating area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7960.18)|
| 2:12:41| And now you've got two commercial properties next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7961.18)|
| 2:12:43| The one that had that outside seating area, their value and use and enjoyment is diminished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7963.9400000000005)|
| 2:12:48| for the drive-through next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7968.460000000001)|
| 2:12:49| So, we think planning did a really great job and we'd urge you to adopt the ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7969.9800000000005)|
| 2:12:56| was recommended through planning and through the second reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7976.22)|

| 2:13:04| I hate to tell you this, but you guys get really into the subtle fine points of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7984.900000000001)|
| 2:13:18| The public is not going to understand that and the headlines are already riding themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7998.22)|
| 2:13:22| Tonight you are going to pass, I'm not sure if you'll pass it on consent, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8002.620000000001)|
| 2:13:28| going to be $80 million in bonds passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8008.06)|
| 2:13:31| And on top of that, there's another, I believe, $70 million for a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8011.54)|
| 2:13:38| And you're willing to do that, but the headlines are going to say you're not willing to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8018.38)|
| 2:13:43| the Sheriff's Office to bring up the level of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8023.26)|
| 2:13:49| And it really is about public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8029.18)|
| 2:13:51| It's not just about treating them special or making sure they can live a luxurious life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8031.3)|
| 2:13:57| Public safety really is on the line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8037.5)|
| 2:14:02| What I don't think everybody understands is that KCSO is the backbone of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8042.02)|
| 2:14:07| and corrections for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8047.86)|
| 2:14:10| If KCSO fails, KPD fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8050.5)|
| 2:14:14| KCSO does the prisoner transport for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8054.14)|
| 2:14:18| KCSO does the prisons for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8058.1)|
| 2:14:22| If KCSO fails, KPD fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8062.8)|
| 2:14:27| So tonight you'll be voting to basically privatize the prison transportation service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8067.02)|
| 2:14:32| because we do not have enough KCSO officers to do the prisoner transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8072.46)|
| 2:14:39| That will come as the Sheriff's Office projects that will save some money in the coming years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8079.02)|
| 2:14:45| but it will then be privatized and you will be then going for a market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8085.860000000001)|
| 2:14:50| So it will catch up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8090.1)|
| 2:14:53| Eventually you'll be paying more for prisoner transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8093.02)|
| 2:14:56| Once it becomes privatized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8096.46)|
| 2:14:59| I am a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8099.02)|

| 2:15:07| I have asked, I've been up here and I've asked you to subpoena several of the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8107.82)|

| 2:15:34| That we have somebody as Republican as the Sheriff and somebody as Democratic as myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8134.38)|

| 2:16:10| If you pass the Mayor's budget as is, KCSO is going to take, it's going to accelerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8170.18)|
