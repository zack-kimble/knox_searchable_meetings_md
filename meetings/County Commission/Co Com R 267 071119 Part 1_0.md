| 0:05:55| Good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Any other business come forward to the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| I've got one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=363)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Why don't you read that into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| At our September 24, 2007 meeting, we had an applicant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| applied and they were approved pending health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And they were also, there was an amendment that they, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| second owner complete the server training program and answer all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| the questions regarding beer regulations and to report back at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| And we have received everything in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| They've completed the server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| We have a copy of their card for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| And they've, we have a notarized statement of the letters that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| asked them at the beer board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| So they've complied with everything that's been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| They were just to report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| They were approved pending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| So that's reporting back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| And what was the name of that one again, the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| This was Creekside Enterprises, LLC, called Hot Iron and Raw Hide on Elk Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=422)|
| 0:07:14| Anything else come forward to the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| U.K., did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| That was the one that Mr. Hammond had asked for the lady to come back before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| But, yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| Mr. Chairman, law directors are working on some new beer laws, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| I want to make a request that anybody that applies for a beer license goes through county codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| and gets a permit to occupy the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| It's in the codes, their codes, and that way the fire marshals can do their thing, the codes can do theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| and I'll do theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Are they not doing that now, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| No, they're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| I can tell you that quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| We're looking at all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| There's a couple of ways to interpret that, and we're going to make that abundantly clear later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| We have a couple of instances in Knox County that Mr. Minot is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| We somewhat have a conflict between at least one interpretation of the beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and the fire code, fire and safety code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| and I would think the fire and safety code would certainly win the day if you're talking about person safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=514)|
| 0:08:42| You certainly don't send someone back into a burning building to exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| So, anyway, we're going to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Right now it's not a huge issue, but we're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Do you know how long before you get back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| How many months do you think that you're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Probably next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Do you have anything from the fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| No, I just wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| I know that several years back when we first started incorporating the fire inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| into part of the beer board requirements, that was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| And at the time, as a matter of fact, we, in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| were requiring whoever applied to the beer board to obtain a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| But it became kind of counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| You know, people were just basically changing ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| We didn't feel like at the time that it was necessary for them to have a permit from code administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| And to my knowledge, that's been our policy ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Now, if the building goes vacant and stays vacant for any length of time at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| then we, in fact, do require them to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| But just simply a change of ownership, we don't require that in a lot of other tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| and it wasn't really something that we felt like was necessary to be required as part of the beer board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| I mean, it certainly could be looked at, but it was addressed at one time before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and it became a problem, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| UK, anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| No, I'd just like to see it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I mean, the problem that way when they get a permit, it's on that permit what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| how they're going to do it, and that's the way the business ought to be run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| Not come down here and get a beer permit and then go up there and start building something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| That's footage that nobody's looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| If they're building something, that's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| If they're just, if they're, even if they're remodeling the inside, that's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| We do require a permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| But if it's just taking your name off of the ownership and putting somebody else's name off of it, you're moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| you're doing exactly the same thing they were, then we do not require a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And that, at one time we did when we first started doing the beer inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| but it became a huge issue and that was rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Well, you know, I've been around commercial property enough to know that any time anybody changes it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| if I sell something to Mr. Hammond, Mr. Hammond is going to change it different from what I had in vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| You're going to have some of that because you've got your own ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| And I think the law director is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| We all want to be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I can definitely see the merit of having another fire inspection for on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| You know, a lot of on-premises places, you're talking places that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| have bands and are crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| And I could definitely see the merit in air fire inspectors looking at the place every time it changes hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| Would that create an excessive amount of work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| We do that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| What U.K. is talking about is requiring them to get a permit through code administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| So not only would the fire inspector be looking at it at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| then the building inspector is also going to be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| And, you know, we just don't, we haven't found that to be necessary at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Well, if the groups of you all could work with the law director on that and bring us back, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| We appreciate you guys bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Anything else come before the beer board today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| We hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=750)|

| 0:15:05| He wants to be present when these are heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| They were both deferred in October because of my absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| But I don't know whether or not I know there is opposition to the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| I don't know whether they're here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=917)|

| 0:15:25| when it's heard next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=925)|

| 0:16:32| I think twice is enough to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| You know, we need some closure to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Commissioner Pinkston, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1001)|

| 0:16:55| They've had adequate time, I think, and they also have a lawyer representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| So I think we should hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Well, just for this guy, Michael Rose, he did call the commission office earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| and said something had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| He went out of town, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| He did call the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| I didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| What kind of emergency is it, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| He just said it was a family problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And when he called in, he was on the road to someplace in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| And I apologize to these neighbors and these people who are interested who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| it didn't leave me much time to try to get in touch with anybody to let them know that the request was going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| And I would just simply say, yeah, he has a lawyer here, but he's like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| He is a client, and he is the person who has an interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| He would like to be present when it's heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| I feel like under the circumstances that I'm pretty much duty bound to ask for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| That's what he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| That's what he asked me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| And that's the reason I'm here asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| And I do apologize for not being able to get to him any quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1096)|

| 0:18:19| Maybe you all can come to agreement and come back up and maybe we can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. King, can you tell me why you deferred it in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1103)|

| 0:20:15| Who is Ronald Scott, president of West Scott Realty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Is he your realtor or is he on the other side buying it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| I understand the situation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| And you want to come up to the mic and correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| They were in the process of having this rezoning, this property rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| and West Scott Realty was going to be purchasing the property from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| And I think he's now reconsidering whether he wants to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| And I believe that these folks, the property owners, have decided they want to pursue the rezoning themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| that whether he is the person who winds up buying the property or if they buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| that they want to pursue the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| So I would assume that since the property owner is here, we can go through with this if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Would the permit be in their name and can they apply like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Can we roll it over to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| See, they're not the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Without, I mean, have you been involved in the process thus far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| Well, we agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| We wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Ma'am, I hate to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Can you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| I'm Ellen Stevens Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Yes, it's 339 Three Point Road in Bonneville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| And all along, we have wanted to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| We had planned to do that in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| But Mr. Scott said that he was going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| We were in agreement with that because he was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| At that time, he was interested in the property and for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| We would have gone ahead and done it on our own had he requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| or had he told us that he couldn't or wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| But we just left it up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| And now his plans have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| So that's the reason why he is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| We had all along planned to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| It's just that he volunteered to do that so that we wouldn't have to come in from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Can I ask the law director a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Can we simply amend the item before us to change the applicant to Ellen Stevens Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| and require that applicant to pay any fees required of such a filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| I mean, that's the way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, you have to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| And there may be some fees that go along with that because obviously you haven't paid any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| and it's the request of Mr. Scott, I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| We would be in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| We just wanted to go ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| And, by the way, we weren't informed that he wasn't interested until just recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| or we would have done this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| But this has happened just recently within the past couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Well, then I'll move to change the item before us to reflect an applicant of Ellen Stevens Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| conditional on her paying the appropriate fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| And it's been properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| So if there's any opposition, they should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| It would be in three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I think I need a second probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I do have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Is it in the process of sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Has he paid any earnest money or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Does that make a difference, Sean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Their property, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| You are the owners of the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| I don't know if the needs to be in both of our names as far as changing it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| But whatever it is, we're agreeable to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| We would want all of their names, all the property owners on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1451)|

| 0:26:42| Can we postpone these until the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1605)|

| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| We'll postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1615)|

| 0:26:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1617)|

| 0:27:02| January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Clerk, next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| These are requests of Rod Townsend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| The first is for North County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR, Low Density Residential to MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| Medium Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| The second is for rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| They're located on the southeast side of East Beaver Creek Drive, northeast of Ghirardelli Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| and the Seventh Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Let's get an MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, as read by the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| this is a request for a sector plan amendment from LDR to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| That amendment was recommended for denial by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| And then along with that, a rezoning request for PR plan residential at six DUs per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| The Planning Commission voted to approve plan residential at a density of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| As we understand it, the applicant is and has proceeded, he did present a site plan to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| which was approved that is consistent with the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| and zoning approved by the Planning Commission at plan residential at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| So that plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Of course, it would be contingent upon your approval of the rezoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| The application, especially if you look at your zoning map, the request for plan residential at five dwelling units per acre is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| not too out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Well, it's, I'll correct myself, it's consistent with the zoning and development pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| You do have RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| You have some RB, general residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| And you do have some plan residential zoning that range from one to three to one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| It is located on Beaver Creek Drive, which we feel is suitable enough to accept the kind of development that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:25| by the Planning Commission by means of a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| So with those thoughts and comments in mind, again, the Planning Commission denied the request for MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| but they did approve plan residential zoning at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:48| Hey, Buzz, how many units did he ask for to get MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| I mean, what was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| He asked for six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| That kicked it over into having to request MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Mr. Townsend, do you want to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| You can go first if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| You have up to five minutes, and it's 418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Hey, Rod Townsend, PO Box 138-37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| I covered county commission for a couple of years as a reporter years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| and I understood the need for getting neighborhood buy-in to developments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| So last July, when we first contracted to buy this property, we met with the adjacent property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| one of the adjacent property owners, and then met with the other one later that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| Neither one of them expressed to us any concern whatsoever with the development that we were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| We showed them pictures of the units that we were proposing, which my partner, Lee Mayshark, handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| One of the issues that arose at that time was one of the property owners, Mr. Neely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| owned a piece of property behind the piece of property that we've contracted to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| and he wanted us to buy that piece of property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| We told him at the time that we were in the middle of getting this piece rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| and that once we were finished with that, we would agree to buy his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| The second piece of paper that was handed out was a --"shows the development as designed."| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| We did not put a cul-de-sac in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| It is not, you know, cut off at the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| The road can extend back to his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| So we felt that we've done everything in good faith that we agreed to on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| We went through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We went through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Both of those votes were by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| There was no opposition voiced at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| After that time, there apparently has been some opposition arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| and from what we've been able to understand, there are three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| We told the folks that were opposing us at the end of the last meeting when it was postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| that we would be happy to meet with them any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| I talked to Mr. King, told him the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| We have never heard back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| They have never contacted us to try to talk about any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| The three areas of opposition that I'm aware of are, one, drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| which I think will actually our development will improve the drainage in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| because it will put in a retention pond and prevent some of the water that's spilling over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| onto the other side of Beaver Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Number two, one of the opposition was that they wanted screening in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| The agreement with the MPC requires us to screen the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| So that's two that we're meeting and probably improving the situation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| The third area of opposition is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| The density at five units per acre is within the LDR sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| which is approved for that side of Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| We did not push the MDR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| We did accept the LDR zoning or LDR, and that's what we've proposed our development based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| The third issue that we feel is in support of our arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and our proposed development is the MPC votes, both of them by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| And in their report, they point out a number of different things which should allay some of the fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| One, the development density is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Number two, the proposed development is consistent with all relevant requirements of the PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| as well as other criteria for approval of a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And number three, and probably most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| the proposal is consistent with the adopted plans and policies of the general plan and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| The use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| The use will not significantly injure the value of the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| So based on those three arguments, we would request your approval of our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| And I think Mr. Don Garrett, who's the property owner, is also here and would like to speak to you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| We need the opposition first, and then we can do rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| So does someone want to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Mr. King, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| I was contacted by Mr. Neely, whom I represent, who is an adjoining property owner to the west of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| He also owns the parcel to the south of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Mr. Neely's home is on the west side of the property on about 2.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| The parcel behind is about 1.61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| I know that Mr. Ellison is here, who owns property on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| I believe Mr. Linkus is also here, who is here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| Let me clarify a couple of things first, and I'll let, if need be, Mr. Neely speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| There was some misunderstanding during the course of rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| and the submission of a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| and my client indicates to me that they were not fully informed as to that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| and therefore didn't speak in opposition at the time of rezoning before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| They attended the use on review matter before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| and did not understand what it meant for this item to have been placed on the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| They were there to express their opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| only to later learn in the course of the meeting that their opportunity to have done so had gone by the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| because it had been put on the consent calendar to which they didn't interpose an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Needless to say, they engaged my services at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| The use on review that was approved has been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| It is set before the Board of Zoning Appeals for later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| And we also oppose a request for an application for a variance that has been submitted by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:28| to reduce the peripheral setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| That also is set for BZA this coming week on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Speaking directly to the issue of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| perhaps Mr. Townsend forgot that following the last meeting I said we would talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| And I did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I talked with my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I contacted Mr. Townsend, discussed it with him on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I didn't raise an issue about screening as I interpret the conditions suggested by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:06| It would have included screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I didn't really talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| What I told him about were two issues predominantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| One related to drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| A lady by the name of Smith who lives across the street has a substantial problem with this proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| because of her concern that a more impervious surface will mean more water on her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| The other issue I mentioned to him was density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| And maybe he doesn't now recall, but what I told him was that in looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| the most dense utilization on, if you will, our side of Beaver Creek Drive is at one to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:53| The only other density in that range is across the street, and that's at one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2273)|
| 0:38:02| What I told Mr. Townsend was that we understood his interest in developing the property, but we've got 2.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| He proposes to put six duplexes on it for a total of 12 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| and one detached single family for a total of 13 units on the 2.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| We said we believed that to be too dense and out of character with the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| the residential development, but that we were willing to accept three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| I got a call back later from Mr. Townsend who told me that they intended to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| with their request for five units to the acre, and I told him that we would simply have to be opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| Given what he said and what I said, I don't know that a meeting was necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| but we certainly had communication with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Having said all that, I'm back to my main issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| There is along the eastern boundary of the proposed property for rezoning, along the eastern boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| sort of a natural drainage way, drains toward the northeast of the corner of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| goes into a culvert under the road and ends up emptying out on property across the road, which is Miss Smith back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| And in addition to the density, she has a problem along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Our major problem is, if you look at the surrounding development immediately surrounding this piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| and indeed even taking into account the other developed areas that have developed at a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| nothing in the area is at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I respectfully submit that under these circumstances, given the size of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| and the nature of the property, that a rezoning at one to three dwelling units per acre lets Mr. Townsend go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:55| and develop this property, but develop it more in conformity with the surrounding residential property as developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| And we would request no more than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| All right, Mr. King, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I think Mr. Neely might like to respond to this idea advanced by Mr. Townsend about his interest in selling the property to the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:18| if you all are really interested in what that conversation may have been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| You may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| It doesn't really necessarily have anything to do with zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| but there is maybe a little bit of an alternate view about how that discussion occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Opposition wants to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Someone has up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| And if you would, sir, if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| My name is David Neely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I live at 906 East Beaver Creek Drive, which is immediately west of the property we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| I also have a piece of property at 910 East Beaver Creek, which is immediately behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| And as far as insisting on selling him this property, that is nothing could be farther from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| They called me three times on the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I didn't return the call because the caller ID said it was Southland Realty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| and I had no property to sell or none to buy, so I didn't call them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Three or four days later, someone came to my front door named Ira Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| He said he represented Southland Realty, and he had a contract on the property next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| and he understood that I owned the property in the rear of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I said, that's all true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| And he said, would you consider selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| I said, well, the property, my daughter has lived there for seven years, but she's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| She moved out last week, and I would entertain an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| And he wanted to know if I would meet with these fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I said, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| And I met with him three days later, and I called him before I met with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| I said, listen, I have got the foggiest notion what to ask for that property, but I don't think, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| He said, well, it's somewhere in the range of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Well, that's a whole lot of money for an acre of ground that don't have one inch of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| I thought, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| And he also said, by the way, would you pay a two percent sales commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| I thought, well, I'll ask $105,000, and if they're stupid enough to buy it, they're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| They've got what they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| And that's what I asked them, and I didn't hear any more from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| That's the story on insisting on selling the property to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Opposition, you still have about two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Does anyone else like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| I'm June Smith, and I live at 921 East Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| I live right across the road from my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I live right across the road from where they're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| I'm all for improving the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I'm all for building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| I've been there for 33 years, never said a word when they built all around me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| and they built up and they ran the water over on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| My house is starting to sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| My husband passed away, and I can't afford to put everything back up where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| So I do have a problem with this, and I just wanted to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| The applicant, you've got about three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| I want to clarify what Mr. Naylor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| We did meet with him twice out at the property after these phone conversations took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| and we told him exactly what I said, that we would buy his property after we got this rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| To address one issue, right behind the lady and to the, well, it would be towards town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| there are quadplexes already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| So while there is one to four units per acre already out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| like it would be extremely non-character with the rest of the one to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| most of that one to four is at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Don Garrett, the property owner, can address that better than I can, so I'd like to call on him now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:32| My name is Don Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I live at 1509 Frosty Way, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| I just wanted to speak on behalf of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| I think it's a positive development for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| and wanted to point out here with the map where our parcel resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| North across the street is the Giardelli subdivision at PR4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| Here at the south is the new Wren Creek subdivision, fully built at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| Adjacent to this property, excuse me, near this property to the east is a new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| Autumn Place, I believe it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| That's a multi-density type plan residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| To the west are several condominium developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Sir, can you step back to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I'm having some trouble hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| So the area is definitely consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| and the multi-density growth that we see in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| And so I just wanted to indicate also that this particular rezoning does not landlock anyone's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:46| As Mr. Townsend has pointed out, he has a very high-quality luxury condominium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| or duplex development plan for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| which will add close to $2 million of additional appraised value here for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| and consistent with the area of these multi-density developments that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| The property, I believe, will be a very positive development for the area as it grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| And it would prevent things like mobile homes coming in or lower income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| There's nothing wrong with that because people have to have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| But it would keep the value of the neighborhood, in my opinion, very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| and very upscale for the area of what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| And it's for these reasons that I think this would be a positive development for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| that is consistent with the zoning plans in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| And I respectfully request your positive vote for this zoning request of PR5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| Question of Mr. Townsend real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| These duplexes here, some people have been asking, are you going to rent those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Are those rentable duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| No, it's our plan to sell them as condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Mr. Nicely, would you come up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Mr. Nicely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Neeley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I'm sorry, Neeley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Would you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| While he's coming to the podium, Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you've had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| We can't talk anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| But these people have come to my office and I don't know, I think they've been in contact with you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Hopefully you know that you've had a chance to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I know you're familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| I want to comment to you, Mr. Neely, on what you do and how you're doing it, the professionalism that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| and your people are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| A lot of people come and they get upset and irate and they don't really have a dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| and anything that they're really after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| But the way that you all present yourself, I was very much impressed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| And I understand the misrepresentation at the NPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| That happens from time to time and Mr. King was trying to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| You know, commissioners, I've passed this place, I guess, more than anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| And for what they're asking, they're not asking to stop the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| but I'm in agreement with these individuals here that six per acre is too many in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| There are some subdivisions across the street and then the others behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| And those are nice subdivisions that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I'm thinking putting 13 in there, the duplexes that they have, is just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| So I'm going to be making a motion that we go three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| And I just want to appreciate the way that you all have conducted yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| I'd like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I'm definitely not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| I understand that the county has to have development to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| They've got to have development to get revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| They've got to have development for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| And I'm not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| They developed 153 houses across the street from me and 130 next door to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| And you folks didn't see me up here one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| They were all single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| They were all --and I've got some good neighbors out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Some of them are with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| But I appreciate you listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| And anything you can do for me, I'd appreciate that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Mr. Naley, the homeowners group or the people in opposition, is three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| What's the price point of these units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Or what do you estimate that you're going to sell these for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| Our projected price is around $140,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| About $140,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| And I'd like to ask Buzz, his plan to deal with the flood water, is it going to help this young lady behind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=2991)|
| 0:50:02| Or is it going to hurt her even more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Well, I can tell you that this was reviewed by county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| and has to follow their specifications and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| We also include in the recommendation, even after it's approved and used on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| that any requirement that Knox County has with regard to drainage, flood control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| and those sorts of things has to be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Now, I can't speak specifically to the plan as it relates to the lady's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| but it has been reviewed by engineering and any recommendation or any change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| or any requirement has to be met as the property is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| And, sir, are you happy with the three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| The project won't work at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| The project won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| What is your bare minimum that the project can work at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| We need five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| We tried to get the six to get the units evened up on the duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| but we ran into opposition from MPC there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and we agreed most of that area is already zoned LDR in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| So rather than fight the sector plan, we said, fine, we'll go along with MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| which is up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| First of all, let me clear up something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Commissioner Smith, on the first item you want to recommend MPC's recommendation is to deny MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:37| and then on the second one is at a density up to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3106)|

| 0:51:50| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Can you come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| You said the units are going to sell for 140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| You have mainly, as I understand, residential around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| So at 140,000, how many square feet is that per unit do you project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| They are 67 by 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| I think they're 1,250 square feet each, plus an attached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Two bedrooms, one bath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Two bedrooms, two baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Two baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| So what is the market that you're looking for on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| It would be broad-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| They're all one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So it could be for retirees that are wanting to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| It could be for starter homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| It could be for families with one child, possibly, you know, a second young child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| If you've got a motion up here for three units an acre, would you rather not have nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| I just spoke with the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| and he basically said that he would like to see it withdrawn if we're not going to get the five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| So, I mean, I don't know how we go about that, but if you've got 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| Yeah, I want to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Well, I mean, has his motion been seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Then I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Chairman, what if I make a substitute motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| That way if we get enough votes to withdraw, we'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| If not, we'll go on to if that's what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| I mean, I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| He does not want the property rezoned at three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| That way we'll just be voting on a withdrawal instead of voting on a density level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| And that way he can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| That way he can always come back at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| That may need to come back through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| It would have to come all the way back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| But if we vote the three units per acre, how long is it before it can come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| A year, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| So if we don't withdraw it, it's a year before you can address it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| But if we withdraw it, then you can negotiate with the mayor, the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| So I'll make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Maybe you want to negotiate with the mayor, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Let Mr. Townsend decide if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Well, I'll make a substitute motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| And then we can debate whether or not we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| I guess my question to him, are there any number less than five that you would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Three and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| No, I think we're at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| I'd have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| He was asking if we would go with four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| I'd have to look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I haven't actually, you know, run the numbers at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| Well, now we've got a motion and a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| So we've got to deal with these now before we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| On the substitute motion to withdraw it, then we can come back in a month or two as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| We've got to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| We've got to go back through the whole process, back through MPC and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Oh, if it's withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| And if you go through and it fails, then you can't come back for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Then let's withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Can he come back with a request for four units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Can he, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Yeah, he can come back at any time, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Less than a year is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| If he withdraws it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Can he change the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| So, Mr. Townsend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| All in favor with oh, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| I think I don't want these gentlemen to go off under the wrong impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:48| The matter was the rezoning was approved at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| It is appealed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| If it is withdrawn, I believe he has to wait a year to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I'll yield to the law director or Buzz on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I think Mr. King is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I was sitting here trying to run it through my mind, but I think in our administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| the clock starts ticking with your action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| And a withdrawal and a denial are the same thing in terms of how we treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Yeah, but, Buzz, if they change it just a little bit, they could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I mean, if he came back and asked for four and a half units, or he came back and asked for five and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| If he comes back with a less request, I think we could hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Now, if it's more, you have to pick a whole new zone altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| But I think he could come back with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I'm not going to propose to argue with that particular assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I just wanted to call to the attention of this body that the rule that is being referred to is an administrative rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| of Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| And Metropolitan Planning Commission has its own lawyer, and so who is obviously not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| But, you know, I hear what Buzz is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| I know that if you come back and you propose a different zoning classification or a zoning request that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| substantially similar to the one previously presented, you can bring that back within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Mr. Townsend, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| What we would propose is reducing it from five to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| That would be an acceptable arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| We've got a substitute motion to withdraw, but you don't want to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| So let's take that up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I'll remove my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| I'll remove my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Now we're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| I'll make a substitute motion that we go four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| And can we ask Mr. King if they oppose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| Most respectfully, we do oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| I talked to these people when they first contacted me at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| I understand the nature of their issues and concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| The number of units that go on there obviously create more impervious surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| Now, there are regulations in place as to what kind of detention facilities they have to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| But Ms. Smith already has a water problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| The same drainage way will exist after this is done, and it will still be putting water onto her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| She, therefore, I believe has a very legitimate concern that the more impervious surface there is over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| the greater the volume, if you will, of water is, and particularly at certain periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| There are times now when she has water standing in her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Additionally, if you look at it, on this side of the road, if you'll look at how the property is developed on this side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| in the general area of this request, you'll find larger lots already built out with existing homes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:18| They have substantially less density than what you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| The most density on this side of the road anywhere in the general area is at one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| This is a 2.4-acre piece of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| If you're going to put 12 units on there, you're going to have a road right through the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| and everything stacked right down through it in order to get them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| You know, I'm another appreciator of development and understand the need for development, residential and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:57| I just respectfully submit in this instance that three units to the acre is a fair compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| a fair position for this neighborhood to take, and I fully understand the reasons they're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| and I appreciate the reasons they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| They didn't come in and just say, no, it's all single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| My lot is 2.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| This one is much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| It ought to be, you know, one house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| They took a deliberate attitude, took a fair look at it, and says, rather than the five, we're willing to accept three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:33| and we really don't want to try to compromise on four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| We still think four is too much density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Respectfully, we would oppose the request for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Well, just in general, my understanding of the MPC requirements is no additional water can flow off that land after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| development as before the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So I don't see that we're going to exacerbate the lady's problem with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| If anything, we should improve the problem that she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Number two, one to four units is what's being zoned out there all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| The property behind it is one to four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| The property across the street is one to four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| So it seems to me like four is a more reasonable compromise since when it's one to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| it's obviously four, not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| We would request a vote up and down at the four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Yeah, Ms. Smith, I see your property from time to time and you do have water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Mr. King, I appreciate the comment that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Those houses are down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| They're a lot bigger lots that those are on their own one-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| You know, what disturbs me when Commissioner Lambert says, you know, what do you have to live with, Mr. Towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| and Mr. Towns says, oh, we've got to have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Now he's down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| You know, when I see that, I'm going to vote for the homeowners every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| It's like, you know, you could do on one per acre if you had to, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| I'm sticking with the homeowners at three per acre, and just as Commissioner Ballard said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| those that are beside there that we're looking at, those are single family dwellings instead of multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| What is Ghirardelli?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Is that at four units, one to four units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| I think if we go down to four that that's pretty close to Ghirardelli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| and that's right across the street, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| But if we give him three, I bet he could live with three, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| He's come six, five, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| He just keeps moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I think let me clear something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Commissioner Hammond, on the first item, do you want to add to MPC's recommendation to deny MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=3776)|

| 1:12:23| Typically, when you get out into some of the more rural areas doing the boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| sometimes they come in less than what you think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Sometimes with right-of-way dedication, that becomes a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| And we're not going to get to two units an acre on this amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| But we don't want to be caught in the middle where we're losing a couple lots because of rounding up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| rounding down, based on the acreage being somewhat different from what it is on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| So that's why we would like to have flexibility to go to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| although we know that we're not going to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| but don't know exactly where we will be between one and a half and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I'd like to go ahead and make the recommendation that we go up to two on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| I visited the property, know it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| And like he says, he's probably going to hit somewhere with just a couple of houses above the 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| So I would like to make a recommendation that we'll go to two on this and accept the rest of it as per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:26| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4412)|

| 1:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4419)|

| 1:13:54| The third is an appeal of Hardin Valley Land Partners LLC owner of TTCDA approval of condition to use only high-pressure sodium lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:02| The property is located on the northeast side of Valley Vista Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4442)|

| 1:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:09| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:11| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:15| Seeing no opposition, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| This is an appeal of action of the Technology Corridor at all in authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| So we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| The TTCDA turned this down for reasons that it does not meet our guidelines as they are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| And I just wanted to let you know that we did have opposition here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| And we tried to vote on that last month to go ahead and turn it down since they weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| And, you know, this month I don't know why opposition didn't show up this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| But I know that it's still a concern and the TTCDA does have guidelines that everybody knows when they buy property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| out there what they are and what they need to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| And I'm going to ask again that we uphold the guidelines for the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Do you have a second to Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I second it and put it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I just want to say that, yeah, we did have opposition last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| But we didn't have what I consider we didn't have neighbor opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| We didn't have any, you know, real opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| We had a representative from the Tech Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And as far as I know, I don't believe that the Tech Corridor had any opposition from neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| If the people who live in this area don't have a problem with it, I think we ought to go ahead and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Commissioner Leuthold, would you respond to the lighting problems that the authority sees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| Well, what we're talking about is the light that diffuses on to other property and creates, I guess if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:21| lighting pollution, if you, for a better term, that the corridor authority has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| we've established these rules to try to not have overspill of light on to neighbors' properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:43| To try so that as development happens out there, commercial type development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| so that it is a little more friendly to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| And this is why we've developed the guidelines the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Buzz, if you'd like to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Commissioner Leuthold is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| The idea is to try to maintain and keep lighting at a level that it doesn't create what is called light pollution or visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:16| So you cut down on the glare, you cut down on the lighting, the light that spills over into other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| It's interesting to note that other developments, this is part of what's called the Vista de Amante mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| You probably have seen it if you've driven north on Pellissippi right before you get to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| It's interesting to note that other parts of this development have been approved with a high-pressure sodium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:48| And so we're being consistent with what has already been developed in this particular overall mixed-use project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| It's consistent as long as I've been with the board with other similar types of development that require lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:06| It's meant to try to keep lighting at a level that is reasonable, that doesn't create glare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| that doesn't create spillover into adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| So, Buzz, why was it approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Why does MPC approve of it if the lighting is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| We approved it using high-pressure sodium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| That's what he's appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| The recommendation was a positive recommendation to use high-pressure sodium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| He's requesting metal halide lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| So he's appealing that one condition of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| In other words, he wants to be different from the other development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| other people that are developing the property in the same development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| I mean, he's wanting an exception that there's already other people that have developed property out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| and have adhered to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And he's asking to have a different type of lighting than what other people out there are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:05| and what the guidelines call for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| And like I said again, the guidelines are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Before they buy the property, they know what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| And they're coming to the commission for an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| And TTCDA has been very consistent of denying the other types of lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:28| And I think that they do that simply so they can just get right here to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| because they know that they're going to get turned down by the TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| so they can appeal it to you all and to us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| I just, like I said, I have not got a single call from a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And let's look at the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| I mean, this is very close to Pellissippi Community College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:56| It's not too far from several gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| It's not like this is right in the middle of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| It's not like we have a lot of neighbors complaining about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| And in fact, I don't think anybody complained to the tech corridor folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| I think what it comes down to is the tech corridor folks are extremely rigid with their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| They don't see any exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| This is becoming a semi-mixed use commercial residential type area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| And I don't, I have not had any complaints from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| If this was right next to a subdivision and if the people in the subdivision were up here complaining about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| I would probably be in favor of denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| But we haven't had a single real complaint except from a body who is just very rigid to their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| There are exceptions to every rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| That's every rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| That is why these folks have the ability to appeal it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| They have appealed it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| And there's no one here asking us not to allow this gentleman to use this type of lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| So I think that for lack of opposition, we need to allow him to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Buzz, is this lighting that he wants to go to, is it quite a bit, is it less expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| What's the difference in the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I don't know the difference in the cost, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| I think it's a little bit more glaring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| It's not as, it's a little bit more harsh than high-pressure sodium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| But I can't tell you the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| You know, Commissioner Lambert, people aren't going to be complaining until the lights go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| until the lights are turned on with, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| I just don't see Pellissippi State and the Huddle House complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Commissioner Lambert, as far as being strict, yes, we do have guidelines and we do stick to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| But we do show flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| We show flexibility when it comes to setbacks, when we see that there is a need to be flexible with our setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| We do show flexibility in, like, parking lot size for a parking spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| And so those are just two examples of where that board has consistently granted variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| And I'm sure there's some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Buzz could probably tell us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| There's just a couple of examples off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| So that we do take a look at each individual case and see if there are ways that we can try to work with the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:43| But as far as the lighting, we have been very consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| And in this situation, tell me what neighbors are going to be damaged by the, I think you're calling it light pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:57| Well, we have, you know, Commissioner, we do have other developers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| And we do get complaints from time to time from developers out there that have called up and have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:11| you know, I stuck to the rules and now you've given an exemption or someone hasn't followed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| And we do get calls on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| We get calls about signage not being done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| We get calls about roofs being different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| And we do get calls from time to time where most of them are following the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| and then every once in a while someone doesn't follow them and we do get calls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| Now, whether or not we'll get a call on this one, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=5020)|

| 1:49:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6565)|

| 1:49:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| I'd like to draw to this body's attention not one but three areas where within the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| and a half this particular nominee has run into problems with water pollution control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| Case number 7-219, he's the owner of a property on Jefferson Park Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| was penalized for actions related to stormwater and runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| At the Carpenters Ridge Subdivision in January, there was another stormwater pollution plan problem, sediment runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6596)|
| 1:50:05| A notice of violation was issued later that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Rather than that being approved, the property was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Then the Coopermeters Subdivision, also a problem off East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:20| Again, stormwater problems, runoff problems, contractor problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| It seems to me that we can do better than put someone on the public building board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| who's routinely running into problems with his own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| I think there are better nominees out there, and I encourage this board to find one and to reject this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| A wise person once said, a man who makes no mistakes usually doesn't make much of anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| I think based on the level of development that Mr. Davis has going on in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| that the fact that there are so few mistakes that you were able to find when you did your check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| shows how conscientious he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| When you're out in the world doing things, well, I mean, did you check his driving record too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| I'm sure a man that drives a number of miles per year is occasionally going to get a parking ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| Based on the amount of projects that Mr. Davis has going on, your numbers are very, very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| A man can't do building projects without occasionally having some problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| and it's my understanding that he has addressed each of the problems to the satisfaction of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| and local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| I just don't see this as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| I think that the data that you're bringing us actually shows what a great job Mr. Davis does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| because it's so little data based on the amount of projects that he has going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| I think that this man has shown exceptional leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| He actually served on this commission at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| and I think he is exactly the kind of person that we need on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| Commissioner Harmon, do you have some other details about the violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| Was it notice of violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Were there penalties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Was TDEC involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| I'm still hearing from TDEC regarding two issues, the Millers Plantation Site 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| and a site across from the Carpenter Ridge Subdivision, but I haven't gotten full information on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| I'd just like to point out that there are plenty of developers who have spotless records in the past year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:36| There's a developer in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| They're called small developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| And small developers deserve a representation on this board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| I'm just saying based on the number of projects that they have going on, they haven't had any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| A person who has a large number of projects is going to occasionally have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| You take someone who specializes in historic homes, like, for example, a guy named Dan Shu in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| He's got an excellent record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| He's always up on top of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| He's involved with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| He'd be an excellent nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| There are citizen action persons, community group persons who'd also be well represented on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| I think we can find a better nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| That's my entire point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| And I think we're very fortunate that Mr. Davis is willing to serve this county in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| I'd just like to add something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| You know, we need to quit trying to tear people down whenever someone's going to serve on a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| or we're not going to get anybody in Knox County that will step forward to serve on any type of board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| And, Commissioner Harmon, I think January 31st that Mr. Davis was the person you were supporting for county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| That's absolutely true, but it wasn't in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| It was against a particular other nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Commissioner Harmon, did he satisfy those complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| In one case, he selled off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Other cases, I believe there were fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| You can take a look at them here if you'd like, and they're available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| I was asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Did he sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| One, I believe there's one outstanding notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| Mr. Chairman, is this committee, the commission's appointment or the mayor's appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:25| I think it's, is it the mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Our appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| Right, but we cannot pick anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| That's what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Mr. Harmon was talking about we could make a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| On our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| The mayor and others can make a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Scott Davis, could you come in here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| I've got a question I want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:57| While you're coming to the mic, Commissioner Lambert was talking about the projects and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| About how many projects did you do last year or the year before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Give us a number of projects that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| In the past eight years we've done 39 subdivisions, totaling probably 2,800 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| Tax revenue to the county, if you figure the average house is probably $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| You talk about somewhere in the $400 million worth of, $400 to $500 million worth of property tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:31| To answer your question, 39 subdivisions, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| He impressed me when I was on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Every month there was one that came up and at one time I asked him, I said, how do you do what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| I'm just amazed at what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| Commissioner Harmon, you're talking about getting somebody there with historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| That has nothing to do with public building authority, I don't think, with what we're trying to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| It's the mayor's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| In fact, based on the cost per square foot of Mr. Davis' projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| versus the projects of a historic restoration person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| I would say that Mr. Davis probably brings a lot more wealth of experience of how to build quality structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| to serve the community needs at a much better price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I would say his qualifications are actually greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| And Mr. Davis, thanks for your willingness to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| I'm embarrassed that you're getting this kind of scrutiny today from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and I just want to thank you for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| It's an honor to have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Mr. Davis, a couple more questions if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| Would you mind responding to where the stormwater violations were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Just briefly, some of them, a couple of them that stand out in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Harmon, if I'm understanding, and I apologize, I couldn't hear exceptionally well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| To my knowledge, we've had three violations where we've had a major storm, what they call peak storm stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:09| You can have silt fencing that gets overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| If you get sediment into the streets, you can get a violation notice for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| all of which you have a certain amount of time by which to correct the problems with the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| which we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| To my knowledge, there is not any outstanding violations that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| We work very closely with TDAC to help prevent stormwater runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| and the TDAC representatives come out and look at our sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| We work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| When there's an issue, they bring it to our attention and we correct the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| What do you feel about our stormwater ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| In your process of doing business, do you think that what we're trying to do to protect the public's water supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:56| do you think it's appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Have you altered your business practices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Are you more careful since those violations occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| I mean, between TDAC and what Bruce Waitaker's office is doing with Chris Grandjew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| significant changes have been made to protect the beauty and nature of this area with regard to our lakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| and the rivers that are what bring people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| So to answer your question, yes, we're probably spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| we probably in the past year and a half to two years probably spent an extra $250,000 on stormwater protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| with silt fencing, erosion control, sediment basins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| So we are spending a considerable amount of money to help protect the streams and the lakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| And, yes, as Commissioner Lambert pointed out, we make mistakes and I readily admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| We try to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| We spend the money we need to to get it corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| but we try to protect the streams and rivers to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| Mayor or whoever, how long is this appointment for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| How many? Four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| And is it a volunteer or is it a paid position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| It's a volunteer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| One thing that hasn't been mentioned in all this has been Mr. Davis' service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| He served on our Parks and Recreation Board, volunteer position, exemplary service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| and many of you at our recent Legacy Parks Foundation where he donated 22 acres of his own land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| to be used as greenways and for recreation space across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| So in an era when public scrutiny runs pretty high, as well it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| I wanted to also mention those things to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| So, Scott, you're willing to serve on this board for four years with no pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| Okay. Mr. Lowdry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Just one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| This is a commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| Well, what we have is in our charter is by resolution the commission may appoint members to a lot of boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7193)|
| 2:00:01| and PBA is among those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I'm not saying that the resolution is improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| The resolution is certainly proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| By resolution this commission may appoint members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| So if you were in favor of Mr. Scott Davis, then you would vote in favor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| If you weren't, you would vote nay, and another name then could be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| This is a commission appointment for the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| We've got a motion to approve, Mr. Davis, and been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| I want to mention real quick, Mr. Davis, during these debates we were looking for county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| I think you were the only one that was going to come to the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7238)|

| 2:09:34| there a motion? I'll make a motion to approve. Okay. Is there a second? I'll second. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| Any discussion? Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I might. Basically what this does is it adds to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| ethics committee the wording that any elected official of Knox County would not be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| to advocate, recommend, directly supervise, manage or cause the employment, appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| promotion, transfer, advancement of a relative. And it goes on to define relative. And I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| Mr. Law Director, that the definition is already in the, so basically it's just reaffirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| what's already in our policies. This is out of the Knox County policy handbook, the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:14| handbook if you will. The definition for relative is straight out of that handbook. Okay, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| Hammond, what's the difference in this policy and the one that's in the handbook now? We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| talked about that in our ethics committee meeting, John, and if you'd like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| that. Well, certainly what this one does, it places the elected officials squarely within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| the ethics policy. Of course, Knox County, the administration of Knox County has for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| all of its employees a nepotism policy. Doesn't necessarily, wouldn't necessarily apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| elected officials. This does. But all Knox County employees are governed by a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| that is very similar to this. As well as sheriff's department employees, they have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| policy. Knox County school system, they have their own policy. But this places elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| officials squarely within the mandate of the ethics policy. And I would like to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| add that this was unanimously passed by the ethics committee after quite a bit of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| on it. But as the law director said, this puts the elected officials right squarely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| in not being able to take a relative and I mean this basically would say that the relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| would get a promotion or advancement or job on their own merit, which is the way it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| be and not through any outside influence from an elected official. I just have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| for Mr. Hammond. I noticed that the ethics committee minutes are attached. I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| to assume that this motion only reflects the wording of itself and that no other item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| came up before the ethics committee is being proposed at this moment. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| Only this one item, yes. There will be others coming, but we want to have a workshop with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| the commission to go over those. This is the only item that would be affected by this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Thank you for that clarification. Commissioner Luto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| is it better to pass this as its own or would it just be easier just because I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| we have in the chart already says administration, would it not be easier to just say administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:20| and elected officials or is it best just to leave it as two separate? You can do it either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| way. I mean you already have the administration covered under the mayor's policies. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| been in effect for a number of years. But what this does is it affects elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| Yeah, I was just saying if we included elected officials to what we presently have, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| it was similar. They're not necessarily governed by the mayor's policies. I mean you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| number of elected officials that they have their own policies and are permitted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| so by state law. So you think it's best to leave it as two separate then? Yes. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| want it to be effective as to all elected officials, yes. Okay. Okay. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7980)|
| 2:13:08| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it. Next item. Resolution 913 is instructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:19| the Knox County Law Director to prepare an amendment to the Knox County Charter to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| presented to Knox County Commission at its December meeting which outlines a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| or a special election option should the Knox County Commission be presented with appointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| two or more elected officials. Intergovernmental? Intergovernmental. Voted 6-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| Finance Committee? 4-1 absent. No recommendation. Do we have a motion? I'll make a motion we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| approve. Do we have a second? Second. Second by Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| I don't know what the Attorney General is going to say. I don't know how successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| we would be in the legislature in getting something passed, but I do believe that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| we have our own charter, that if the citizens of this community decide they want to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| to have a special election, should we be presented with a situation that we were presented in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| in January, that I believe our citizens want the option to vote. And what this would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| is just basically ask the Law Director to look at it, come back to us at our December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| meeting, let us know what our options are, and if indeed the option is present with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| correct wording, then we would vote on it then to go to the citizens for a vote in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| So basically what I'm asking is for the Law Director to look at it and bring us any wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| and see if it's possible for us to put this on the ballot so our citizens can vote. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| Commissioner Pinkston? This is for John. John, I believe this is another case where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| going to have to check with the State Attorney General, aren't you? Well, I certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| When you're talking about a charter amendment, you know, that really falls upon us. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| I'll certainly, you know, seek some counsel from the State, but we'll see what they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| to say. I'm not necessarily committed, certainly, to any advice they may give us. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:15| not throwing stones, but the State Attorney General has been wrong a couple of times in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| the last 15 years. But we're going to do what's right for Knox County, and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| a way that we can accomplish this and present it to our charter, I will bring it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| in December. Okay. I wish you would check with the Attorney General, too, like you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:36| he could be wrong. I will. I don't want to make the people out here think we can do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| we can't do. That's what happened in this special election. And you know, from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| we knew we couldn't have a special election, but people kept hollering, election, election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| and they got the people all riled up thinking they could. And I do not want to disappoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| the people. I don't know that any of us do. And I will let you know what the Attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| General advises. Thank you. Okay. Commissioner Ballard. Yes, basically what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| about is putting this on a ballot. What sort of time frame do you have to have? Is it like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| an ordinance second reading to get it there? For the county commission to put a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| on the ballot, you have to have a two-thirds vote of the body. It's read like an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| It's akin to an ordinance on two readings. And then it would be put on the next county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| general election, which would be August. So it's just referendum? Yes. So and how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| days out does that? To change the charter. So how many days out do you have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:44| We have plenty of days, I can tell you. And it would have to be passed by two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| wouldn't it? It has to be passed by two-thirds of the members of this body, okay? Twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| In order for it to be placed on the ballot. We have plenty of time. I want to say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| a matter of 60 or 90 days. We have three times that. Are you done, Mr. Ballard? Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:14| Commissioner Pinkston and Commissioner Lambert. You know, I don't think anybody here will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| vote against that. I'll definitely vote for it, but I do not want to vote for it if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| Attorney General says we can't do it. That's all I'm saying. Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| I plan to vote for this as well, and especially since it takes two readings for this to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| into effect. If the Attorney General says that this isn't possible, we'll know at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| second reading. Would we know by then, Mr. Law Director? Never know. What this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:49| unless you amend it, what this resolution does, it asks me to come back to you in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| with my opinion as to whether we can accomplish this through a charter amendment. Then it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| go through two readings. Oh, okay. So this is not even the first reading? That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| This is not an ordinance. This is a resolution. Okay. Commissioner Smith. Yeah, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:13| Commissioner Hammond, I want to just publicly thank you for the lead that you have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| the last several months on Ethics Committee and the way you're trying to lead and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| direction you're trying to take this. And I really appreciate that. And the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| out here, I hear it quite often. And I, for one, want to thank you for the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| that you have shown throughout this. Well, I appreciate your kind words. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| make a comment, though, with regards to the State Attorney General. We are in the mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| that we were in January 31st because of an Attorney General opinion. So if the Attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| General comes back with an opinion, I don't know, regardless, that we really need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| with that. I mean, it is an opinion and that's it. And you might accept my advice? I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| accept your advice because I firmly believe, firmly believe that the citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| can change the charter and form their own government. The State Supreme Court was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| clear on that. And so I believe that by putting it as a charter amendment, letting the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| vote, that this would be upheld if it has to go all the way to Nashville to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| Okay, any more discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8353)|

| 2:19:58| Second. Any discussion? I just want to say that I hope that our friends in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| take this in which the spirit in which I'm sure it's intended, which is as a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| toward open government and not as a poison pill. Okay, any more discussion? All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| 918. This is a resolution to fill the vacancies in accordance with Article 2, Section 2 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:30| the Tennessee Constitution. Okay, Intergovernmental? Intergovernmental voted 4-2 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:39| Finance Committee? 4-1 with no recommendation. Do we have a motion? I'll make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:48| approve. Do we have a second? I'll second it to get it on the floor. Okay, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:55| Lutho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Law Director, in the Chancellor's opinion, or his ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8455)|
| 2:21:06| he talked about although we are a body of 19 normally, he gave us, and we're now 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:21| he is opined that our quorum now is 6. Is that correct? That's the guidance that he gave us, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:33| And the rest of the opinion goes on. He talks about that our quorum would change as these positions are filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:42| Is that correct? That can be read. It says filled, and I guess my question is what does filled mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:54| Does it mean when they are appointed a commissioner or is it once they are sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| I don't know of any commissioner on this body that wants to do sort of a rolling type of appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:14| I think everybody on this body has voiced their opinion at one time or another that they want to be able to just do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:22| without anybody getting sworn in during that time. But the last thing I want to see happen is that for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:30| to challenge the procedure that this body takes down the road after we make these appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| and try to challenge that we did not adhere to what the Chancellor said, and that was to change what our votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:45| the number of votes for someone to get appointed once we start filling these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| You know, we're 11, and then when we have, we make the first appointment, we're at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| Well, now that takes seven votes, and then you're at 13, and that still takes seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| Then you add one, and now you're at eight votes, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| And the last thing I want to do is to have a procedure that may be flawed because we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8586)|
| 2:23:15| or may not have a good definition of what the Chancellor meant by filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:25| So, and I guess before we go too further, I think we need to have those questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:34| The last thing this county needs to be is in another lawsuit once we think we have these appointments made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| and we find ourselves in court again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:52| On first blush, if I recall, Mr. Law Director, you felt like he said something about a rolling appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8632)|
| 2:24:04| And I had spoken to other attorneys that thought that might be what he was alluding to as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| the Chancellor, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| It's nice that another attorney shares my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| Let me talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| I just think that's a very important question to be answered before we can go much further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| I think we can answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Not that we need to go back to the court for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| What the court said in a footnote, it's footnote three to the court's opinion on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:41| Among other things, what the court said was, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| you have to look to the Knox County Charter in order to fill a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| Under the Charter, the court said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| in the event of a vacancy in the office of a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| the remaining members of the commission shall fill said vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| That's section 2.8 of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| The court went on and said, when a seat is filled, the person holding the seat is a member of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:09| The court was talking about the quorum requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| The court was saying, basically, you don't have to have a quorum of ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| We're down to 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| It doesn't take a quorum of ten to conduct business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| It takes a quorum of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| What you have to do, I think, too, is to go back to the law as the judge understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| We pulled a jury instruction that the court approved and read to the jury, and it goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:40| Under Tennessee law, any person appointed by the county legislative body to fill a vacancy in a county office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:47| may take office immediately upon being appointed and qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| Qualified means that the appointee has performed all acts required after appointment to take office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| including the oath of office and posting an official bond if required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| The oath of office for any appointed county official required to file an oath may be administered at any time after the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:12| So when you're talking about filling a seat, it's more than just a one-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:21| You have to have the appointment, and you have to be qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| In order to be qualified, you have to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| And in my opinion, you ought to have your oath filed with the county court clerk, with the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:36| Well, that's the question that I wanted to know, because if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| when at that time Commissioner Billy Tindall was appointed clerk, he was no longer allowed to vote on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:53| That's a different rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:54| That's a different rule where you have a different charter provision where if a member of this commission is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8814)|
| 2:27:01| then our charter provides that they shall be immediately removed from this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| So he was no longer a member of this commission at the point that he was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| Now, he wasn't qualified to hold the office of clerk until he was sworn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| until he had taken his oath and filed his oath with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071119-part-1?start=8840)|
