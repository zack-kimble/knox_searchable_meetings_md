| 0:03:44| our mission is to revitalize low- and moderate-income communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| and strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| We accomplish this by working with community partners on many programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| with various federal, state, and local funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| Our desired outcomes are to provide decent, affordable, healthy, and energy-efficient housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=244)|

| 0:04:34| to promote economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| and to be responsive and create collaborative partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Our department's organized into several divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=285)|

| 0:05:18| And so if you want to pull from your package, the next handout, it's called, at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| Five-Year Consolidated Plan Goals, Specific Objectives and Priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| These were the priorities that were developed with our five-year consolidated plan in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| and they guide our work through the five years that follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Our next consolidated plan will be developed in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| So on the left side, you see the federal objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Those are the requirements of the funds that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| And so the federal objectives are to provide decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| create a suitable living environment, and to create economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| And under those objectives, our goals for housing focus on home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| rental housing, and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| For living environment, we focus on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| And for creating economic opportunities, we focus on economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| So as we go through our budget, you'll see how we allocate our funds to meet these various goals and objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=383)|
| 0:06:36| Becky, is that the same as last year, the same objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Yes, yeah, this was developed in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| We keep these priorities unless there are reasons to make major changes for the five years that the consolidated plan is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| And every year, we update the consolidated plan with the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| And that's what we're presenting to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=415)|

| 0:08:00| And then we completed acquisition and rehab of foreclosed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| And those were implemented by various partners, Habitat for Humanity, KCDC, and KHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| And all those projects are finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| We're in our final phase of drawdown of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| So at the end, we will have drawn down all the funds we received through NSP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=504)|

| 0:08:31| Those were ARRA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| That grant was finished last September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| And with that, we did an energy retrofit program for 30 homes in the Park City neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| And we also completed three facades on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| With our HPRP money, Homeless Prevention and Rapid Rehousing, those were also ARRA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| That was completed last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| We funded Homeless Prevention through case management and Homeward Bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| and also a legal aid project with Legal Aid of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| How much were those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| The CDBGR was $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| I believe right around $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| And HPRP was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I think it was a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| It was more like $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| On the homeless, is that where the case manager, the money from the city goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| Well, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| That covered that for that time period until that grant ended, which was in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| Last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| So some of our recent accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| For homeownership, if you recall, we had a partnership with Pinnacle Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| They provide $2 million of private bank funds to the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| to benefit our owner-occupied rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| We've completed over 80 projects and hundreds of individual activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| home rehabs, properties, loans, and services to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| In September 2012, the city co-hosted the first ever accessibility event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| which brought together design and construction professionals to talk with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| with disabilities about accessibility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| It was a very successful event, and we will do that again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Under homelessness, Menville Manor was awarded the 2011 National Trust HUD Secretary's Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| for Excellence in Historic Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| And the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness kicked off in February 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| We've had two meetings with the full group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| We are meeting in small groups, probably two meetings each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| and then the plan will be developed and brought before council, hopefully this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Is that community groups or is that internal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| No, it's community groups, but primarily providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| homeless providers that deal with these issues on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| The leadership from these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| It's different from the homeless coalition that's been meeting monthly for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=689)|
| 0:11:41| Some more highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| We've worked with the Vacant Properties Committee on tax foreclosure reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| and blighted property ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| We have created partnerships with our CHOTOs in completing new housing in various neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| and we are developing a capacity-building training program for neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| and that's done through our Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Also, we had a very successful Neighborhood Conference that was held in March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Under economic development, we've completed additional improvements to sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and drainage in the 4,000 block of Martin Mill Pike to solve flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| We completed phase one of negotiations with Gerdau and Tamco in preparation for a Lonsdale Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| and we have initiated the facade improvement program for the Magnolia Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| We've just closed on two properties there that will have facades as a result of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| How much money do we have for the facade program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| For the Magnolia Warehouse District, we had $400,000 for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Do you still have some left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I think it's all allocated, Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| It's all committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Becky, what are those two properties on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Do you have that before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| Oh, for the Warehouse District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Yeah, one is the White Lily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| It's in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| It's not specifically on Magnolia, but it's in the Magnolia Warehouse redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| It's the White Lily Flower Building, and the other one is Gray Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Plumbing company, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Well, we have a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| The teachers' credit union is going in on Hall of Fame in the old Chariots of Hire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| So that's also receiving a facade, if you know where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Where did they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I'm not sure where Chariots of Hire moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Chariots of Hire, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Chariots of Hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| They've sold that, and the teachers' credit union is going in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| and will be providing facade funds for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| I think all that road work had narrowed the amount of parking space they had and stuff in the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| It was kind of widened there, and it took their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Continuing grants, we're still working on Plan East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| That's the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| The deadline to complete that is January 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| We'll have all our funds expended by the end of December for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| and that was a $4.3 million regional planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| So right now, we still don't have actual numbers from HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| as far as what we'll have to spend beginning July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| As you know, there were continuing resolutions that were voted on in Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| and so that's what HUD is being paid with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| And so we don't have our actual fund numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| We did get caught up in sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| So what we were told to estimate is to take this current year's allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| and decrease that by five percent in order to plan for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So that's what we did for our sources of funds, and from that, we've built our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Our final numbers, we're hoping, will come in on the 30th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| That's when we hope that they will be to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Your expectation is that's kind of the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Our expectation is this is very close to what we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| So you see those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| CDBG is $1.4 million, a little over $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| HOME is down to $853,000, and emergency solutions grants will be $139,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=971)|
| 0:16:22| So with those pots of money, then we work on the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| and that details how we'll spend our federal grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| community development block grant, HOME investment partnership program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and emergency solutions grants for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| It's guided by the plan priorities that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| that were laid out in the five-year plan and HUD regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| It considers the needs of the target areas that were established at the consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| We always try to leverage other resources wherever possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| so that we can create the best projects with the smallest amount of federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| We try to be very proactive and not reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| and we are progressive in future thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| That's our approach to community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| When you work with people like Habitat, do they fund part of the project and you fund part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| In other words, they bring some of their Habitat money as well as their physical resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Yeah, typically the way we work with Habitat is through property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| and then they will purchase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Turn it over to them, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| They'll purchase them through Homeacres, through our Homeacres program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| so that they'll have a lot to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We do not provide funds directly to Habitat for building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| but we have helped them acquire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| With our NSP money, we helped them acquire some foreclosed properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| that they built their new silver leaf development on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| That was a foreclosed piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Do you have any more like the bank that gave you a foreclosed house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| That was pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| That was a good way for them to get a tax write-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Yeah, occasionally banks will approach us to donate properties to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| We're very careful about what we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| We won't take anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| We want to make sure that there's a market for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| Okay, the next slide you have is our map of our target areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| and we've put that in your package as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| so you can actually see it a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| And I'll just briefly go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| These were established in 2010 with our consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Zone 1, our target area 1, is East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and these are a number of census tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| They're based on census tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| That's why they have the shape they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Number 2 is Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| I'm sorry, 2 is Mechanicsville, Lawnsdale, Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| 3 is Oakwood-Lincoln Park and across Broadway in the Cecil area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| And then 4 is in South Knoxville, and that covers severe area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| part of South Waterfront and Vestal neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Does that reflect priorities or just locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| This reflects where we target our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| We can serve families and neighborhoods citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| but we focus our funds in these target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Those are generally low-income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| So with that, we're going to look at the annual action plan budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1187)|
| 0:19:58| They don't have that, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| What you've got there on that slide just shows a little bit about how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| revenue has decreased over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| If you look at the CDBG funds, the HUD allocation in 10-11 was over $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| It's now what we estimate to be $1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| So as far as allocation of funds, we've lost over $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Is the red just the 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| It's 5% off of the current year, which is the year we're in right now, 12-13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| If you look at the HUD allocation of home, two years ago we were at $1.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1236)|
| 0:20:45| and we're down to $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| So you can see there that's another $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| And if you look at the allocation of ESG, we've actually gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Homelessness is a priority with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| So the current year we're in, we received $146,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| With the 5% cut, that will be down to $139,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We've got other funds that we add to each one of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| It's called program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Every year we receive money based on the loans that we've made to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| for owner-occupied rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| So as they pay us back, we reuse those funds in these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| When a house sells, we also get that back in as program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| So that adds for CDBG, we're estimating about $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| No, we're estimating more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| We're estimating $150,000 in program income for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| For home, we get close to $450,000 annually in program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| so that helps add that to our pot of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| And we don't have any program income in emergency solutions grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| So if you'll turn to your annual plan budget, it looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Yeah, I'll cover that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Yeah, you can see once again our allocation of CDBG from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| We're estimating $1.483,872.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| We don't have any carryover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Carryover is when you have a project that didn't complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| or you didn't finish it, and so you have funds to carry over to the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| You don't lose them at the end of the fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| You don't lose funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| You lose your admin funds if you don't spend them, but those are capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Not the programmatic funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Programmatic funds, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| We estimate $150,000 in program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Our total CDBG for next year we figure will be $1,633,872.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| Our home allocation we're estimating at $853,787.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| We do have some carryover from previous projects of $175,675.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| Like I said, we'll receive program income of about $450,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| and then we have a repayment that was made on a project, and that's $480,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| So actually our total home funds that we can use for projects is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| It's $1.959,462.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| And home funds are focused on housing only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| That's the only thing home dollars can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| Emergency solutions grants, we estimate our allocation to be $139,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| We do have carryover of $20,000 from a project that did not pan out in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| So we're estimating $159,332.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| So our total budget for all of our activities and projects for the coming year is $3,752,665.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1454)|
| 0:24:29| So the next form you have breaks all these funds down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| If you could turn to that handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| And you'll see how we allocate the funds to meet our priorities under each one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| Under A, home ownership, our owner-occupied housing rehab program, that is a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| And you'll be seeing some pictures along while I talk about the funds of pre-, before-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and after shots of some of the ones we've completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| We're allocating $100,000 in CDBG and $780,000 in home for a total of $880,000 for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1501)|
| 0:25:11| CAC emergency home repair, we are allocating $280,000 in CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| Neighborhood housing that also does a minor home repair with volunteers, $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| Disability resource center, they provide ramps and accessibility features on the exterior of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| We're allocating $19,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| City of Knoxville down payment assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| These are down payment funds that help our community housing development organizations sell their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| So we're able to provide some down payment assistance for low-income families to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| And that's at $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| We do have a set-aside for our community housing development organizations, or CHODOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| Those are agencies like Knox Housing Partnership, Neighborhood Housing, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| East Tennessee Community Housing Corporation, and CAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| And they primarily build new homes for purchase by low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| Before you leave those pictures, you've got some pretty steep front staircases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Does that handicap people from using those homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| I would say on those, those are new houses, so they have to be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| So because of the topography of the lot, they had to do the stairs in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| but there is an accessible entrance either on the side or the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| I notice on the yellow house there's a garage or a driveway or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| There's a driveway that goes in and there will be a zero-step entrance on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Right, on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| That's one thing that we require for any new construction is at least Energy Star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| in energy efficiency and visitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| We also have set aside some homeownership development funds for the model block in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| We have been acquiring properties in a block that is close to Lonsdale Homes for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| and we have preliminary designs that have been done by the East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| and our partners will be working with us to build houses in that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Becky, if I'm not mistaken, this is the courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Yes, that property there was a foreclosed fourplex that was vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| It was purchased by Knox Housing Partnership with Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| and we provided also home funds for them to rebuild back six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| It's redesigned the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| They are facing each other, so there is a courtyard between those two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| and that's on Dutch Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| What about those funky roofs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| They don't look like they fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Well, that's a matter of taste, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| You know, it was designed by a local architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Is that you? Is that your fault?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| It is fully occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| It looks like it's less expensive than a hip roof or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| but it also looks out of character with the typical house you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Well, if you go out there and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| it's in an area where there's a lot of different multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| and there's some commercial buildings around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| It's not in the center of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| I'll defer to our Frank Lloyd Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Far more attractive than what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Far more attractive than what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Plus, it's occupied, it is LEED, it is visitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| and there are several units that are fully accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and so we're very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| The next thing, rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| We are starting a new project, really a revamp of an old project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| We used to have rental housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| We have noticed that there's a need for more rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| and so we will be allocating some funds for that beginning July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| $100,000 in CDBG and $378,000 in home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And that's for landlords to get a loan from us to fix up properties for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| They have to maintain the rents at low levels for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| depending on how much home funds they get from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Is this KCDC managed housing or is it privately managed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| No, this is privately managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| It can be two units, four units, multi-unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| but it's an opportunity to provide some additional dollars to landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| so that they can fix up places that might be vacant or blighted and rent those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1811)|
| 0:30:21| Next category, homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We provide funds to our homeless agencies through our emergency solutions grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| and that's what those are focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And we focus heavily on homeless prevention and rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| So although we do provide some operating funds to some of the agencies you see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| we also focus a lot of dollars on getting people into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| either through payments, mostly through CAC Homeward Bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| but payments of rent deposits, utility deposits, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| to help people actually get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| So you can see what's allocated for those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| And once again, this is all based on estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| but those are small grants to these agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| but they're able to do quite a lot with the little bit of money that we are able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Are these reimbursement oriented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| They're all reimbursable grants, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| You've got to spend the money, and then you go to HUD and you get it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| They have to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| They send us a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| We'll pay their bill, and then we go to HUD and get reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Are we front-end the money here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| The next area is neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| We have a small amount, $100,000 in neighborhood stabilization from CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| Fortunately, we also get city general fund dollars to help us with property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1906)|
| 0:31:54| So we augment the CDBG with the general fund dollars so that we can focus on chronic problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| And you can see an example there of our BURP program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| which is our Blighted Property Redevelopment Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| That's a revolving loan fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| People can get a construction loan from us at 0% interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Once the house is complete, they pay us back in full once they get a permanent mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| or permanent financing of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Here's the model block I talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| This is sort of just some designs at this point of what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| All of this will be new construction for sale homes in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| And this really took care of a very bad blight problem that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| There were some commercial activities that were going on there that were crime-ridden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| and causing a lot of problems for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| So we were able to eradicate that, and we're continuing to acquire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| We'll do some infrastructure work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| and then our partners will be building the houses and selling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Are there any of them up there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| What area is this in Lonsdale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| It's on Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| It's a block north of Lonsdale Homes on Texas to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2001)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We also focus on neighborhood stabilization through our Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| That's funded with general funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and David Massey and his crew of part-time folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| and AmeriCorps people do a wonderful job of working with all those city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| The Neighborhoods Conference was a great success this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and really provided a lot of information for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| We are working on the program that's going to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| and help build capacity of community organizations throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| Economic development, we accomplished that through our Commercial Facade Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| and we've allocated $100,000 in CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Once again, we're able to get city general funds for that program to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| So here's a couple of examples of befores and afters and how that's helped business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| It's really been a very successful program, and we keep having interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Do you have volunteer architects, or these are projects brought to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| What are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Typically, the owner comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| We have an application that they fill out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| We can provide technical assistance to them through the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Is that their design, or do they get outside design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| They get help from us if they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| And there is a committee that reviews facades as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Some of those are really attractive when you finish them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| It makes a big difference in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Just a little information about the Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| This was funded originally with Empowerment Zone funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| and since the inception in 2005, we've put in $3.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| We've leveraged $12 million in private funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| because each one of these projects brings in dollars from the business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| They have to provide 20% of the cost, and most times they provide much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| It's created 702 jobs, and it's retained 214 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| And through those six years, the construction jobs alone on those projects was 418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2150)|
| 0:35:58| How do you count the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Do you just estimate man hours and call 2,000 a job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| How do you know that those numbers are actual jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| We count full-time equivalent jobs for each business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| Based on the number of man hours in the project, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| No, the construction jobs are based on man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| But most of these jobs are permanent jobs that were created because this is a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| Oh, because the site was improved and is now a going concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Many of these properties were vacant, and there was nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| So these are new jobs created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| You breathe new life in it, and that life has workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| So we've completed 65 facades in 94 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Becky, may I ask you a question about the Empowerment Zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| All of those funds spent now, is there anything left with that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| All those funds were spent in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| That was closed out at the end of August 2010, and all the $25 million was spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Just in the last year, this is just the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| we have to track the low-income hires for our construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| That's what Section 3 means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| It means that, you know, someone is of low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| and if they get a job on one of our projects, then we have to report that to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| We also report Section 3 business concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| which are businesses that are owned by low-income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| So these are the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| An hourly wage or a poverty level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It's a poverty level, 80 percent of the area median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| So we're required to try to promote this activity in any of our construction work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| So we sit with all of our contractors, whether it's through owner-occupied rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| or facade or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| If we have construction work, we encourage them to hire from the neighborhood where they are, where they're doing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| and give jobs to lower income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| So for the last year, there were 24 new hires because of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| Sixteen of those were Section 3 or low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| There were 19 trainees on jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And 1.5 million went to Section 3 business concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Eighty contracts were awarded to Section 3 businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| So we had 63% of our construction funds going to Section 3 businesses, which is a very good number, and we're really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2318)|
| 0:38:50| These are like contractors or subcontractors that are low income, having low income employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| They can either have over 50% of their workers low income or they're owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| The businesses themselves are owned by low income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| Since our funds are cut, you know, we've had to make some cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| So as you saw in the budget, we've lowered the amount of property acquisition funds that we're able to allocate to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2360)|
| 0:39:30| Here's some before and afters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| That is 611 Gill on the top, which is now for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| The one right near the bypass road or the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| And you can't hear the interstate from the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| It's gorgeous looking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| I mean, I've been by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| It's really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| They're having an open house next week, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Maybe this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Oh, it was last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| And also it will be open on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| With a tour, yeah, from 1 to 6, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| That's a real success story there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Jonathan or someone did that, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| And then the other one on the bottom, that's on Chicago Avenue, and that's getting sold right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| We listed that in Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| That before picture on the first one gives you the willies, like this is going to collapse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| and then you get this gorgeous end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| That's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Becky, on that one that Councilman Della Lope is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| how much funds were spent to bring that to this picture here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Well, we didn't spend much at all because we sold it in that dilapidated condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| You sold it under the Homeowners Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| We sold it under their Homemakers Program to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| and they put their own funds in it once they acquire it from us, and then they sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| So the cost that we incurred was to acquire it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| We did spend a little money to put boards in the windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| and make it safe so that people couldn't get inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| and we did tear off that back part that was burned because that was really hazardous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| But we invested a very small amount of money to sell this, turn it around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| and then a private developer is the one who's put the money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| The other program that we are eliminating for the time being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| we hope that we can bring it back, is My Front Yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| and that's a residential facade program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| It was very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| We used a lot of Empowerment Zone funds to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| and it's basically a $5,000 grant to a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| and we help them secure a contractor to do landscaping or exterior improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| driveways, things like that to make their homes look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Our waiting list went way, way down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| and we don't have staff to implement this program right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| so we are cutting this program out of this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| If you do this project and they turn around and sell the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| do you get some money back, or what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| We do for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| It's five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| It's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| So if they do that and live in the house, all is forgiven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| but if they just flip it, then you get some reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| It's decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| The amount that is owed back to us decreases at 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Their steps down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| So with that, we will take any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| All your comments will be included in the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| The plan is included in your package, the draft plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| It does come to you for a vote next Tuesday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and then we have to submit it to HUD May the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| I thought there was usually a notebook with about 50 pounds of stuff in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Well, the final one that has all the attachments is that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| So we've spared you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I'm remarkably silent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Yeah, I would just say very well done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| and you obviously have had a good many remarks as we've gone through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| I like it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Any other further comments from the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| We've got public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| I see Umoja's got his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| You want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| He'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Yeah, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| My name is Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| I live at 614 West Hill Avenue, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| When we were looking at the budget and it got down to F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| I don't know if the budget further discussed administrative and TA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| I don't know if it stopped there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I remember hearing about facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| but I don't remember hearing anything about administrative and TA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| and it may be I took a nap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I don't think I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| No, I just wanted to acknowledge that because that's quite a bit of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and I just wanted to hear a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| The other thing had to do with the economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| For years, one of the things that I've talked about in these community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| is economic development funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I mean, housing is important for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| but if people don't have proper incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| it's not a way to create wealth in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| then you're going to forever have people in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| So in looking at the McCannsville Lodge and the Beaumont area specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| but other areas as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| South Knoxville because of what's happening with the bridge and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| is there a possibility that more money from community development block grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| or monies from other places can go into economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| apart from and along with commercial facade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Because commercial facade is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| It means you have a building and you're fixing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| But funding actually to develop economic development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| people who want to start businesses, start up capital, various things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| So my question and request would be that we solicit money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| or try to find money to actually help people start businesses down Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Texas Avenue, University Avenue, wherever it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| where a business person may want to start a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Because in looking at the five-year plan at the very bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| it talks about increased access to economic opportunities for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| in the low and moderate income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| And if you just have money for facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| that doesn't necessarily increase access to opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| in the low and moderate income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| So those two things aren't really that consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| So we want to make those consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| We don't want to eliminate this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Because I know a lot of times you make presentations and you talk about government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| and the next time you see it, it's gone because you talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| So we're not wanting to eliminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| We wanted to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| The next thing it talks about increasing access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| to low and moderate income persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| And that says that's medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And then the other one talked about remediation and redevelopment brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| So I would like for us to accentuate the economic development piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| in number one and in number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| And also look at how we can remediate and redevelop brownfields areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| The other question I had is that I don't know if UDAG money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| urban development action grant money is still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| But I was at city council one time when I heard someone say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and I think it was Martin when he was here before Mayor Hassan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and it may be still available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| that the UDAG money was put into some kind of foundation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| So could you do some research for me, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| to see if urban development action grant money is still available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| and if it's put into some kind of foundation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And we'd like to know how that money can be dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And on Mayor Brown's talk about the activities as far as empowerment zone money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| President Obama extended empowerment zone until the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| So by him extending it to the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I don't know if that allows us to get some funding on the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| if that means that, and Becky said that the money that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| the $25 million, has already been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| So I don't really know what that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I know I did some reading on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| It talks about tax abatement, tax incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| It talks about hub zones and enterprise zones and all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| So what I'm talking about more than anything else is for us to maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| these capabilities that may be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And so I would like for some research to be done on the empowerment zone extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| because I think we thought it ended in 2010 or 2011, but it actually is not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| There are funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| and I don't know if funds from the federal government is available because, you know, what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| But, and Becky's saying no now, so maybe the research has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| You need to get to the microphone so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I do want to go over our administrative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| I just left it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| But as far as the empowerment zone goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| my understanding is that the tax benefits have been extended through 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| which means that a business can get payroll tax abatement if they hire someone from the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2939)|
| 0:49:08| So there are no empowerment zone funds available for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| but businesses can access through the IRS a benefit for hiring someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| So that's a way, I mean, that is a way of promoting job creation in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| There's no grant dollars, but there's tax credits for businesses who help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| If you hire someone who lives in the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| then you get some credit on their payroll taxes that you have to pay as a business person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| What about his other question about fostering business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| It almost sounded like a small business administration type pot of money rather than a HUD one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Well, one thing that was started with the empowerment zone was the small business loan program through the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| They continue to operate that fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| and they do provide up to $100,000 in loan funds for small businesses to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| It is a startup program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| They're applying for community development financial institution qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| They're very close to receiving that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| which will allow them to get more funds that can be used for small business loans as well as technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| That's the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| They run that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| It doesn't come through your group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| It started through the empowerment zone, but they operate that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| So there is a program in Knoxville that can provide loan funds to small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| And we do promote business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We do it through our contracting work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| We promote business jobs for low-income folks as well as through our facade program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| We wished we had enough money to fund a job creation program or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| but with shrinking funds we've really had to focus them on particular areas where we can combine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3059)|
| 0:51:08| with leveraged funds to get the best results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| So I would like to go over the administrative budget just to point that out if you want to get this sheet back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| Is that the money for your in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| It's the money for the staff and administrative costs for our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| The CDBG amount, 326,774, that's capped at 20 percent of our allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| So that pays a number of staff and it pays for various administrative costs for people that work with CDBG programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3094)|
| 0:51:43| The home administrative dollars are capped at 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| and that pays for like a couple of people that work specifically on home projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3107)|
| 0:51:55| The home rehab admin is funded with CDBG funds, and those are project delivery costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| That's for staffing that works directly with each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| For example, they'll work with a homeowner to get their loan underwritten and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3127)|
| 0:52:16| The loan servicing person works on all the loans, so that person is paid with that funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| The construction supervisor and the construction person that goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| and makes sure all the construction is done correctly is paid out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| So they are directly tied to an activity that's funded through the housing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| That's all five percent less than it was last year or this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Parts have been cut too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| We get to add our program income in before we cap it, but because that's new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| But it's all based on a percentage of the grants for the other specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| It's based on our allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| It's based on our allocation plus program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| ESG city admin, we're able to recapture 7.5 percent of our allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| which is a very small amount, but it does help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| And then we do grant to the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| We grant them some funds, a little over $47,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| because they provide a lot of technical assistance and design assistance for our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3200)|
| 0:53:30| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| There was one other thing about UDAG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| There was UDAG money that we received from an old grant for the old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3214)|
| 0:53:44| and that has been paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| We don't receive any more UDAG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| That closed out this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I thought Jim York said part of it went for the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Did it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| I don't think it went for the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| Some of the UDAG funds were allocated to a downtown project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| and there may be some left in that pot, but there's not much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| But all that, that came back to the city over a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| but there's very little left in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| So it came back in the form of some kind of income and was then used up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| It was loan payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Loan repayments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| They came back to ñ it was granted to an entity that fixed up the old courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| back whenever that was done, 80s, I guess, in the 80s, and then that money was repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3269)|
| 0:54:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| The only other question I had was that 15% of the funding that comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| community development block grant, I think also that comes to home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| and I don't know if it comes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| ESG stands for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Emergency police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Okay, ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| It can be used for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| I think it's for service information or to help nonprofits in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| Could you just define what that service means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Because I was told that it's flexible and there's a capability of capacity building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| which I know I did read in here there's some capacity building that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Is that 15% of $3,752,666, or is that 15% of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3340)|
| 0:55:52| What is the 15% of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Of the CDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Ms. Wade, why don't you ask your questions and we're going to have to ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| you're going to have to speak into the microphone because the audience can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Why don't you get your questions and then let her address them rather than back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I think that's the only one, Vice Mayor, that I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| But also I wanted to state that in the president's extension of the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| it was renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| There's a name that I can't remember right offhand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and there may not be any money remaining in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| However, if that was renamed, which it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| there could very well be empowerment zone money in another area that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| So what I'll do is get that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| But the only question I have right now is 15% of what can be used for social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| And if you'll explain, Ms. Wade, the ESG, the acronym, because they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| Pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| ESG stands for emergency solutions grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and those are focused on homeless prevention, rehousing, and homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| He's talking about the 15% public service cap that's on our CDBG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| We are allowed to provide public service funds to various agencies for childcare, job creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3434)|
| 0:57:24| a number of things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| But we can only provide 15% of our funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| The rest of them have to go for other types of activities, bricks and mortar, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| Because we continue to lose funds, we have really cut back on our public service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| We consider all of our ESG funds to be public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| They are providing services to very low-income populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| and we're not required to use 15% of our funds for public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| So we really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Just a max, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| It's a max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| It's a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| It's a cap, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| We're allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3487)|

| 0:58:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| But because of public input and the nature of the consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| and the needs of the community that was established in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| we have focused primarily on housing and homelessness and neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| And you're two weeks away from submitting this to HUD, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| It has to be in by May 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130425_201908?start=3523)|
