| 0:01:41| I thought you called me and I said here, but I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Eight present, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas, if you'd like to give a brief welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Okay, I'll start. Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| I really appreciate the opportunity to continue our comprehensive discussion on reimagining public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| and today's topic on use of force within the National Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| As many of you know, Chief Thomas and I, along with the Use of Force Policy Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| reviewed this policy earlier in the summer in order to make sure our policies were aligned with the Eight Can't Wait campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| And what we found is our officers are already in compliance with most of these practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| And the few that weren't, we made some modifications to put some of the practices in writing more explicitly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=150)|
| 0:02:38| and made some changes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Many of our officers are out there facing hazardous challenges every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| And I'm really glad that we have the crisis intervention training and our academy training curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| to make sure that they can handle those in the safest way as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| De-escalation is a huge part of how our officers deal with these challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| And like all of us, they want everyone safe at the end of the day, the officers and those they're interacting with in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| In most cases, by far most cases, strategies like just having an officer present, verbal commands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| and, of course, de-escalation are fully successful at achieving the desired outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| whether that is protecting the safety of someone who called 911 or taking someone into custody who's committed a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| So just I'm going to give you one preview of a number that I thought really resonated with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| As we know from a workshop, previous workshop, KPD answers close to 180,000 calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=214)|
| 0:03:43| And in 2019, KPD officers engaged in out of those 180,000 calls that actually required an officer to respond to a scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=223)|
| 0:03:53| In 2019, only 122 incidents required any documentable use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| So that's 122 out of almost 180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| That's .07%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| So while we all want to see that number even lower, that's a telling statistic that to me speaks to the commitment of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| who are always seeking ways to de-escalate tough situations and use force only when necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| So this can be a tough topic to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Public safety is a top priority for our city and for me and I know for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And if people do not feel safe and protected, they cannot thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| So that means different things to different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| And I appreciate all of you for taking the time to discuss this and make sure we continue to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| So thanks again, Vice Mayor McKenzie and council for continuing to take a deep dive into these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| And I appreciate Chief Thomas and the other KPD officers who are here to walk us through some of the details of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| And I'm really impressed with their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| And, of course, our new Park Director, LaKenya Middlebrook, is also going to be presenting later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| So I'm going to turn things over to Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you again for everybody being here and your willingness to listen to us and learn about this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| It is one of the most important policies we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| And it is talked about throughout our training, almost any training we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| And we call it use of force because that's technically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| But it is our last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| And I want to make sure you all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| We don't ‑‑ our goal is not ever to use force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| We don't ever want to lay hands on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| We always want to be able to ‑‑ we call it talking them into handcuffs or talking them into what we need to have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| That's the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| That's why we have become more verbal, why we have started talking about active listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| why we have got into crisis intervention training and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| So what you're going to hear today is going to sound ‑‑ it may sound a little bit harsh and a little bit more warrior mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| But remember, this is a last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| This doesn't happen on all our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| It's statistics that you'll hear a little bit later in addition to what the mayor just gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| It doesn't happen very often at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| And it's always documented when we do use force because we want to know what caused that, what could we have done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| One thing that Director Vaughn, when he was over, when he was the park director, used to say all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=374)|
| 0:06:24| and I really appreciated that he did, was comply now and complain later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| So if there is somebody out there who thinks that they're not going to go, they shouldn't be arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| they're not going to sign a ticket, we would ask, you know, comply now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Ask for a supervisor to come to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Complain to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Complain to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Complain to the DA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Anytime later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Just to avoid the fight at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| To avoid the altercation at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Because if we are ‑‑ believe we're making a lawful arrest, we have probable cause, we have to effect that arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| So, again, force is our last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| And amidst this policy is a lot of de‑escalation and last resort is laying hands on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| So in the next slide I think is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| It's the policy of the Knoxville Police Department to value and preserve human life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| That is our basic tenet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Value and preserve human life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| That is the most important thing to us, to keep our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| So I want to real quick introduce who I've got here with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Hiding over here in the corner is Lieutenant Sammy Schaefer, who you met last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| He is the training director at our training academy, where our recruits get their first taste of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| And I have Sergeant Amanda Bunch, who is a member of our internal affairs unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| and is one of the ultimate reviewers of use of force reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| And I have Lieutenant Keith Dubow, who is an instructor in use of force at our academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| And I think you're an expert witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| I've been retained as an expert witness for other jurisdictions in use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So he has a lot, a lot of experience in this area and well respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| As we go through this, one other thing I want to talk about is that we've talked about us being accredited through CALEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| And CALEA standards, their rules, their policies that we have to follow, there is a whole chapter on force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| And so we are lock and step with everything they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| So they are very strict on how we do things and what we can teach and the types of force we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| So know that as we go along, we follow CALEA very, very, very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| So, again, I really appreciate that you all are taking the time out of your day to learn about this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| because it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I think when Councilman Roberto first started talking about some training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| what they had gotten in the past as a council was a little bit less than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| I think it was firearms train simulators and some vehicle stops and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| So we're taking a lot deeper dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| So I really appreciate you all doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| I think it's hopefully garnered some understanding, but it also lets us know what you are thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| and what the public is thinking about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| So we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| So I'll be quiet now and turn it over to Lieutenant Pope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| If you all are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| So I think the next slide is the general information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| It talks about when force is authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| When this force may be exercised to effect an arrest or take somebody into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| Not all people we take into custody are necessarily being arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| There are times or cases where folks are having issues mentally that we'll have to take them into custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| and that can happen, to protect public safety or defend themselves or other officers or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Regardless of that situation, though, the officers only use that force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| which is objectively reasonable based upon the totality of the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| and only use force when no other means or all other means of advice, warning, and persuasion have been exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=596)|
| 0:10:06| So what guides this and what guides our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| It's a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| It starts out with the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| We, the people in order for a more perfect union to establish justice, promote domestic tranquility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| provide economic defense, and more specifically when we're talking about force for officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| we're talking about a Fourth Amendment issue, the right of the people to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| And typically, these force issues or when officers apply force, it is within the boundaries or an intrusion within the Fourth Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=630)|
| 0:10:42| If you're talking correctional facilities, you can get into the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendment thereabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| but typically it's Fourth Amendment issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| So we use that Fourth Amendment as the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Then we go on into things like state law, which authorizes and guides our use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| which will be a change coming up here sort of as directed by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| The policies through CALEA, there are several of them that regulate everything from the types or use of weapons that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| how often we have to recertify on those, the types of less lethal, the chokeholds, if you will, or the lateral neck restraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| CALEA gives guidelines on all of that, which we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Both our code of conduct and use of force are also used to assemble that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| The city ordinance themselves that authorizes the use of force are also used as well or kept in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| So if you look at the next slide, how is the use of force policy assembled here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Again, the CALEA guidelines are one of the bigger driving forces that kind of give us that alleyway to travel down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| Then review of applicable case laws, Tennessee v. Garner, Graham v. Conner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Graham v. Conner is the one that established that objectively reasonable force used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| When we talk about that, oftentimes it is confusing and you want to say, and everybody would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| you use the least intrusive or minimum amount of force necessary to affect the arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| The courts have upheld that it's objectively reasonable force based upon the totality of the circumstances of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| That is to say, and I've used this example and I'll use it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| we have one officer, Officer Cox is 60-something years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| I won't divulge who he is, but we have an officer that's 62 years old and 110 pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| versus we have Lieutenant Stan Cash who's 6'3 and 240 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| The force that they can exert with specific tactics are going to be completely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| and the interpretation or the perceived threat from an attack or resistance is going to be completely different as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| just because of the dynamics, the physiological characteristics of the officer or the offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| That brings into play the whole objectively reasonable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| The case laws, and there are several other ones out there, they also guide us more specifically in our less lethal stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| what we can use, what we can't use, when we can use it, when we can't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Those combined with instructor certifications that are usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| we look at the batons, the tasers, the pepper sprays, our specific defensive tactics, our unarmed combatants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| Those are all done through instructor certification programs, through vetted programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| such as Mnodnok or Gracie MMA or Taser now, which is now Axon International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| But all those programs are vetted through those companies which usually go through either the IACP or Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| and have those programs certified as well as many of the state posts or police officer standards and training commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| Using those and the Force Science Institute, which most of our internal affairs and several of our instructors have gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| using that information, it gives us that foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| We also on an annual basis with the Use of Force Committee review the Use of Force Analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| That's a driving force that shows us what's working, what's not, and where we need to tweak and improve our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| So the committee makes these recommendations and sends it up to the command staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| They look at it for a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| That's pretty much how we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| In looking at the aid camp, wait, where we brought that about and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| if we look at those individually, the CHOCOLs, the Knoxville Police Department has never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| at least in my recommendation, I don't believe the Chief, have ever authorized CHOCOLs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Now, we have in the past and have since gone away with the lateral vascular or bilateral neck restraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=903)|
| 0:15:12| which is not quite a CHOCOL, but it is restricting blood flow to the brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| and using just basically making people pass out to get them into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And we have banned those as well, and that's one of those that the governor's mandates will cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| We'll do a little bit of a change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| But we have never authorized CHOCOLs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Required de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| We have incorporated de-escalation training in almost every aspect of Use of Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| whether even deadly force to get verbal warnings, but almost all of them there is some sort of de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| and de-escalation of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| It's a two-way door there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Requiring warnings before shootings when all other means have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| With the exception of protecting yourself or someone else in those exigent circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| training is right in tandem with giving those warning shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| And I will say even with the less lethal force, most of it, it is trained to give warnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| stop or I'll, stop or I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| In case you stop or quit resisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| So verbal communication and the issuance of warnings is paramount to the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| And you see, ban shooting at moving vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| As far as I can remember, we have never authorized firing at or from a moving vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| unless all other means of apprehension have failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| and there is imminent threat to someone else of serious bodily injury or up to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| So we always ban that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| The continuum, the Use of Force continuum was in the policy up until about two years ago, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| and we removed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| So continuums were developed in the early 90s as training models to assist officers in a visualization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| And typically they give you a stair-stepping of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| which isn't necessarily realistic in the street application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| So that's the reason we took it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| But it does give you a very good mental picture and a chronological order of force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| from the presence of an officer to the deployment of deadly force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| That, however, in a street environment, isn't necessarily how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| The officer's job is to objectively and reasonably select the level of force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| versus the level of resistance offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| So it's not necessarily I have to stair-step through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| And then comprehensive reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| Sergeant Fudge will go through that here in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| But any force which results in one of several things is reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| there's a great deal of force that is being applied out there in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| And I don't know if you've got this handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| But it's if there's medical issues with a person, if they complain of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| if you use any sort of less lethal device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| We got it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Empty, hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Or any empty or hard technique, yeah, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| Injury to suspect, complaints of injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| any force was sufficient to require medical attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| any less lethal was used, any empty hand, hard technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| So that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Any questions on the it can't wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| So we'll amend the bylaw to duty to intervene here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| So that was in our code of conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| When we looked at the it can't wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| we just beefed up our policy a little more by adding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| and reiterating it within general order 1.6 of the use of force policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| And to continue, we put back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Although I would warn against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Here again, it's not a stair-stepping of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| It is not necessarily done in chronology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| It has to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| We don't want to get that perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| It's a very difficult thing to train the new officers not to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| as a stair-stepping event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| But it just doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| It would be nice if it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Beyond the it can't wait, the additional steps and best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| Could I just interrupt for just a second, Lieutenant DeBose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I think if you could just speak a little more loudly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| because you're sort of far from the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| not everyone can hear you as well as they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Can everybody hear me better now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| And before you move on, this is Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| I just would like to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| On the previous slides where it stated ban chokeholds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| and then also there was a ban of the bilateral chokeholds, neck restraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| So is what you're saying is currently as of August, as of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| there are no neck restraints whatsoever that are used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| or are there some neck restraints that are used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| And if so, could you give us an overview, an example of what those are, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| and when they would be applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| So we made the decision when we looked at these just to ban them altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| So I give you a historical perspective of it, but we have banned them altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| whether it's the bilateral or a rear naked choke, which is as it's called today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| So another point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| So in the event that someone has to be taken down to the ground to be handcuffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| and we all unfortunately probably witnessed that video of George Floyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| would the knee on the neck of a person ever be appropriate to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| We do not teach that specific tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| So I will say, yes, that was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| And I would go out on a limb and tell you that every officer at the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| would have looked at that and said, that's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| If you want my opinion, I can throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| There was warning signs of what was going to happen well before that as a medical emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| that those officers should have identified much earlier than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| especially him saying I can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| That's a big keynote for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| It's very interesting when we have cases of in-custody death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| and I'm an in-custody death instructor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| but there are very specific things that can indicate a downward spiral to where it's a medical emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| which I believe he was experiencing a medical emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| And we train our folks that the medical emergency is going to take precedence over the custodial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| So I don't know if that helps in what you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| But, yeah, we do not teach those techniques or tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| The timeline was completely inappropriate in my professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| And I haven't met an officer yet that said that that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| And I don't think these folks would agree with me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I haven't seen anybody go, yeah, that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Okay. That answers my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| This is Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Earlier you said that there is a new policy about giving a warning before discharging the weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1370)|
| 0:23:02| If there were exceptions, if the officer feels threatened or the public safety is threatened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| could you share an example of when an officer would be allowed to discharge their weapon if they don't feel threatened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1389)|
| 0:23:22| So I'm not laughing at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| So it's not a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| If you look at Tennessee v. Garner, which was a 1989 case, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| I'm sorry, 1984, but it was convened or finished in 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| But Tennessee v. Garner says you cannot shoot at a nonviolent felon that's fleeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| and causes or presents no imminent danger to another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| So we train giving warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| So I'm not sure how to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| There is no situation out there that wouldn't warrant giving a warning without there being imminent serious threat to a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1440)|
| 0:24:10| an officer or another person, that we wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| I was just responding to how you described the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| It didn't seem like there was a need for exceptions to the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| Unless it was already in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Yeah, it's in the policy, and it's been in the policy for us to give warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| And there's no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| You always have to give a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Yeah, no, there could be exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| The very extreme is if you had a hostage situation, how would you get a sniper to give a warning on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1482)|
| 0:24:51| Or if you walked in on a robbery or an active shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Here, let's use recent things that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| If you had an active shooter, you have somebody actively engaged in murderous activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| It's not reasonable for the officer to give a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Their job would be to stop that threat by any means necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1510)|
| 0:25:20| Does that help or make it more confusing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| I think that does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| It brought up more questions for me just about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| the role that KPD will play in those situations versus another law enforcement agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Like, do we have snipers within KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| We have designated marksmen within the Special Operations Squad, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1545)|
| 0:26:03| Sorry, I think my video froze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I'm not sure if my question came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Were you asking if we had snipers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| So, yes, we have people that are called countersnipers and designated marksmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| More questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Or should we continue with the beyond the it can't wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Hi, this is Councilwoman Sima, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| I have a question, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Can you, since we're talking about chokeholds and such, can you tell me what a choke job is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| No, I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Well, the reason, I'm sure you know the reason that I'm asking, that this education was going on during a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| And it's terrible to me to hear that that type of sexual violence talk was going on during a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1616)|
| 0:27:10| And I don't believe that it was adequately addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| And that's what determines a culture of an institution on whether that type of conversation is allowed about women, about citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1634)|
| 0:27:31| It's something I think we still need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| So we addressed that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| We are also doing some harassment training that is coming up with the entire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| So I can assure you we do not have a culture of sexual, of any type of that problem in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| If that's a conversation going on, and when it's reported nothing is done, or that I don't know how many people were at the roll call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1673)|
| 0:28:04| that many people were subjected to that sort of conversation, to that sort of lecture instruction, that's when it should be addressed completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1684)|
| 0:28:17| At the moment, and just like your new policies about interference if somebody is getting carried away, I think we need that in these types of situations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1697)|
| 0:28:28| Someone to speak out and say this is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Even if you're speaking to your superior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| These kinds of conversations are not harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| When it comes from institutions that we are supposed to respect, this is important stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| This is, I mean, the levels of violence and sexual violence against women is horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| And we are the example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We are the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| We have to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Councilwoman, can I talk with you about this later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| We can go over this specifically later if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Because I don't care a bit to talk with you about the entire case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| It is something that I want to talk about another time and have it addressed fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| And thank you, Councilwoman Singh, for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I do think that that is very germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| And I think it's more specific to the culture there in that department and that institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| And thank you, Chief Thomas, for agreeing to have a follow-up conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I'd also like to be included in that conversation as I share similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| And maybe the council may decide that everyone wants to be in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| I will poll council to see who else would like to be included in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| But definitely something that we need to have further discussion on in a different setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Chief Thomas, if you guys want to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Can we back up one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Let me make sure we finish that one beyond the eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Just take a look at that recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| So another thing that we had done as well, we added reporting of the requirement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| if a weapon is merely displayed and not discharged and pointed at someone, we are now recording those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| No lethal force in situations involving misdemeanors and unauthorized weapons, i.e.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| flashlights, radios, whatever, may not be used except when there is immediate threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| of death or serious bodily injury to the officer and no other options are readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| And the use of canines is always regarded regardless of the bite or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| We record all uses of canines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| And as well, just to back up a hair, and I don't want to get back into those other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| but the duty to intervene has also been added into that use support policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| So we do require within our code of conduct and in the use support policy, we require officers to intervene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| if they see inappropriate activity occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So just to throw that in there, if that helps at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| And we go on to the next slide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| So the policy itself, once the committee gets done and throws it out to the command staff for their review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| if you look at it, it has definitions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And I won't go through every single section, but if you have questions, please feel free to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and we can discuss those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| You have the policy that gives it out, and then you have definitions anywhere from the act of aggression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| what types of weapons, the type of strikes if we have to use those, impact weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1907)|
| 0:31:56| the definition of objectively reasonable, present, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| And the use of force policy itself and what the policy is, it defines what less lethal force is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| what lethal force is and when we can deploy it, and the documentation and responsibilities of members who do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| and for less lethal force and for lethal force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| And then it gives the initiatives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| So if you have any questions on those, I'm open to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| If you want to look at the, and here's our, if you go to that next slide, if you look at that, unless there's a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| but if you look at, this is our continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| And if you show that continuum on the next slide, if you look at the very bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and it's broken up into the suspect's behaviors or the level of resistance, if it's offered, is on the far left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1970)|
| 0:33:00| The center line is, center vertical line is the officer's response or potential response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1980)|
| 0:33:10| And then if you look on the right, it's what within our realm of force or spectrum of force that's available that the officers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=1990)|
| 0:33:25| Any questions on either one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2005)|
| 0:33:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Am I hitting initiatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| That's me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Oh, initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| If we go back, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| So for the initiatives, and a lot of this we've talked about previously with our training workshop, so I won't belabor them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| but it's worth mentioning because this is specifically covered in the use of force policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| So as we've talked about with our recruits, not only do they learn this policy in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| but then this policy resurfaces every time they learn something within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| So when they receive their taser training or they're getting their defensive tactics training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| or firearms training or baton training or de-escalation and verbal tactics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| the policy comes back up not only as a refresher but to specifically talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| It also resurfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Today the recruits were learning how to document a use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| and they were reminded that, as was mentioned early on in the introduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| that the use of force is the last resort, that we're going to begin with the verbal tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| So this resurfaces numerous times with scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| They're put into situations with simulators as well as with control role players,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and they're reminded of the policies as well as the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| We talked last workshop about the field training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So there now the officer is in the street under the watchful eye of that senior officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| We talked about, and these things are reiterated call after call after call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Continued firearms training, every year by post standards at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| our officers have to complete eight hours of firearms in-service training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Part of that is a review of this policy, a review of the laws and policies that govern deadly force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| They have to requalify with the weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| and they actually take a written test annually to ensure their retention of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| That's in addition to in-service training like we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| The governor's directives are also including some in-service training requirements that are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| I'm happy to say that when everything came to light a few months ago here at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| we had actually proactively instituted some of those on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| So by the time we started getting the word from Nashville, we were trying to be a step ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Roll call training occurs both by way of power DMS or our virtual training online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| where we put out updates or we put out revisions to policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| We have a policy in place for remedial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| So maybe it's at the recruit level, maybe it's at the field training level, or maybe it's a veteran officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| If the supervisor or through a number of systems that you'll hear about later in this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| if we identify that an officer is having issues or has maybe gotten a little bit gray in the areas of these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| we have ways to bring them back in for remedial training and document that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And we put them back through that re-evaluation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| De-escalation, crisis intervention, cultural awareness are all things that we talked about previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| And then finally, supervisor training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| So when our supervisors are promoted, they learn the policy not only as a refresher for them as a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| but their role as a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And as far as watching their officers and conducting reviews that you'll hear more about here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| But anyway, a lot of that we've already talked about, but this is covered, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| within the use of force policy just because it is so critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| Now you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| I'll throw in Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Chief Thomas, I'm not sure who can answer this, but the point was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Sometimes people forget what they've been taught, have to come back in and get some retraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| At what point does a person become such a problem that they would be released from KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| Because I'm sure you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| So can you give us some idea of the officer discipline that would take place that would warrant someone being terminated from KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2262)|
| 0:37:55| And I know that there are HR considerations and you have to speak in vague terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| but I really want people to be assured that we will get rid of bad officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| And we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| And that's coming up in Sergeant Bunch's presentation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| So can I defer to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I just gave the great segue, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And so she's going to talk about a system we have in place and how we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| and then I can build on that when she finishes, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| I don't want to steal your thunder, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So since we just talked about the policy itself, I think it's important to focus on some key response resistance stats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| and we're using the 2019 analysis that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| So in 2019, there was 122 documented force incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| That's a 28% decrease from 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| And with that decrease, I just want to emphasize that came with an increase of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| So I think that is indicative of the new training that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| 2018, we started the in-service crisis intervention training, and then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| we do emphasize, like Lieutenant DeBose said previously, we really stress the escalation techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| in every single one of our tactics in training with any type of less lethal and lethal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| So I just want to hit on real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Last year had 11 firearms discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Eight of those incidents were just used against animals, like an injured animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| and then three were officer-involved shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| The next slide is kind of just a visual graphic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| You can see we had started to see a trend going up toward 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and that's when we implemented the new CIT training during in-service for all of our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| which is teaching that active listening skills and de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| And then since then, as you can see, we've had a dramatic decrease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| and that is with an increase in calls, just like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| And this is just kind of another visual of the instances of resistance that the officers encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2414)|
| 0:40:22| The majority were dealing with active resistance, fleeing and aggression or assault on the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| That really encompassed the big majority of why officers had to use force last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| Next slide is the type of force that was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| As you can see, I don't know if you noticed, it shows fired weapon as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| It's supposed to be three, but that's when we ran the report to do the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| It's all in how we input the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| So we have two cases that were still outstanding due to waiting on pending litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| and they are just now being inputted into our IAPRO system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| So there's just a delay in that number, but the rest are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| But as you can see, this is very indicative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| There's almost 75% of all the force type used by our officers were with our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| We didn't have to use any type of weapons or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| I'm not sure how many years ago, but they've really been focusing in academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| and during our in-service training to our defensive tactics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| and they've been teaching us how to effect an arrest by just using simple defensive tactics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| instead of having to go a little step higher to maybe using one of our other intermediate weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2502)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So that just gives you an overall of the types of force used by our officers last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| And you will see the bilateral neck restraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| It was authorized prior to us changing that policy in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| So that's why you see that on that slide, because this is for 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| This is Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| So I do see where it says fired weapon one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| So there was one instance where a weapon was fired during an arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| That's what Sergeant Buttons just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| There were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| There were actually three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| We haven't put it into the system yet because of the legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| So it is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| And then firearm slash taser threat of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Could you just maybe help me understand that a little bit better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| So basically, it would be what would be considered like show of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| So I pointed my weapon at somebody, so it's a threat of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Let me get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And I'll add in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| So that goes back to the warning, stop or I'll shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| If the suspect stops, we're recording that as a use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and that's what that's reflecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| And the same thing as a taser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| So if I said drop the knife or I'll tase you or stop what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| or I'll tase you, and they'd stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| So it's whether it's the weapon or the taser or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| That's what I would imagine that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| And correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And so the empty hand soft, I'm going to – I think what I kind of took away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| from that is that is where you do have to use some type of physical force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| but it is not as intense as the hard physical force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| which may be a little bit more aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Not a punch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| Not a punch or a kick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| There's the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| That answers my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| So I also want to note that this is officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| and citizen injuries comparison from 2018 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| And, again, with our other numbers, they have all gone down dramatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| which is great because we don't obviously want, like Chief had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| we don't want to use force ever when we're trying to effect an arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| But to mitigate that any injuries or anything like that happen to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| during these arrest incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| seeing that those numbers are coming down is also encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| So now that we've gone over the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| I kind of want to give you a little idea of what occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| when an officer is used force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| And the type of oversight that we require at the Nassau Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| So when an officer has used force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| they must immediately notify their supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| So where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| This slide is different than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| I missed a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| We'll start on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| So, again, so we do report any time that force has been utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| So officers must immediately notify their supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| And now starting June of this year, we have started reporting any type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| short force whenever a fire is intentionally and directly pointed at a subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| We want to be able to track those so that that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I want to emphasize that's intentionally and directly pointed at the subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| not just merely unholstered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| So and then Lieutenant DeBoe briefly covered on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| but since I'm going to go over the step-by-step process of when a use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| force happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| the times that we require a use of force report is when there's apparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| injury or complaint of injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| when the force resulted in the need or request for medical attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| And then a less lethal weapon is used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| not merely just displayed or any empty hand hard technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| So reporting is always required for any use of lethal force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| discharge of firearm with additional reporting and investigative requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| So I just want to touch this really quick with lethal force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| We have a whole other slew of requirements that we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| What I'm going to talk about next is strictly less lethal force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| So if we had a lethal force option or encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| then the on-scene supervisor is just going to make that scene safe and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| of hold the scene secure and gather any witnesses until the Tennessee Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| of Investigation responds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| And then they take over the criminal investigation of that lethal encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| And internal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| all we do is kind of parallel them and then review whether any policy has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| So I just want to make note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| there is a difference between what I'm going to talk about next and then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| lethal force encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| Next. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| So again, like I was talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| we have a great oversight process with our less lethal force when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| So this has been done so that we hopefully don't ever miss anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| And so officer uses force that triggers the required reporting to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| It would be one of those things I just mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| They contact their supervisor who has to respond to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| Once on scene, they speak to the officer, find out what has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| And then they speak to the subject, if possible, and ask them, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| what has occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Because sometimes they'll just tell you, I messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I shouldn't have fought the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| And then they pull the officer's card and they download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| The video card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| The video card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| The video card so that the officer can come back to the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| watch their video, and then complete the use of force report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| Once they do that, the supervisor that responded to the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| they truly are the most critical part in this whole oversight process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| They're the ones that know exactly who was on scene, which officers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| there, which officers need to be listed on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And then they have to review every single aspect of that report and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| make sure it's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| They watch every single video of every officer that was on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| And then they have to write their, like a supervisor narrative is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| And they describe what they did when they went to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| And then whether there's any policy violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| So the most common, I would say, in our use of force reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| has been a lack of microphone being on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| So they have to make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| They either address it with, and Chief can talk on that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| but if it's a minor violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| then they can do something as simple as talking to the officer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| counseling form, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| But they do address things at their level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Once their review is done, then it goes up to the lieutenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| who then has to watch every single video themselves as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and then do their own review of what they watched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| And then, again, it goes to the captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| They do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| They have to watch every single officer's video that was on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| They don't just take the word of the sergeant and lieutenant below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| They have to make their own review and write out their narrative of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| they perceived and whether things were within policy or not within policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Once that's done, it's sent to Internal Affairs for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And, again, we do the exact same thing like the lieutenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| and captain would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| We obviously aren't on scene with the field sergeant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| but we watch every single video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We review the report for completeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| If we notice that there's any discrepancies, we can send it back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| say, hey, you need to add whether the suspect was injured or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| Usually by the time it comes to us, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| there's rarely any issues because there's so many levels of oversight before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| it even gets to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| But we are kind of like the final backup to making sure that all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| policies and procedures have been followed and documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| It has to be documented if something has been violated within that use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Because that the sergeant is the one that kind of will notice whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| use of force was outside of policy or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| if it is more than just something as simple as a microphone issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| they realize that there may have been a bigger issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| then they can request us to do an actual Internal Affairs investigation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| And I'll let the chief talk about that once I'm done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| but if it turns criminal in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| then I'm not sure if we're handing that over to the TBI as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| But anything that's just admin side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| and it's more than just something simple as like a microphone issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| then Internal Affairs can actually open up a full case and to review what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| had happened during this use of force incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| So are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| I have one, Sergeant Bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| You talked about how a show of force report was required when a firearm was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3118)|
| 0:52:07| intentionally and directly pointed at an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| Is a show of force report required if the firearm is drawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| but not intentionally and directly pointed at an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I'm sorry, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| So, like, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| the best example I have of needing to do a show of force report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| like if I responded to a business burglary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| the door's been kicked in, I'm going to draw my weapon out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| and I'm going to clear that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| and it's going to be ready to encounter any type of threat that might pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| So if someone ends up popping up and I'm like, you know, put your hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| get on the ground, and they comply and do all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| that is what would trigger a show of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| because I have intentionally pointed my weapon at the person giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| commands, and then they comply, and we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| We are now reporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| So if you draw the weapon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| it may not instigate the need for the report under the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| but you might have it drawn in a certain situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| and then that would bring that necessity of that report forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| So if I just think that something might be going bad and I get my weapon out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| and I have it pointed at the ground or even at the low ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| which is what we consider pointed down at the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| at the point that I have pulled it up and pointed it towards somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| intentionally, like I am intentionally pointing it at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| giving you directions to whether you're on the ground like a felony stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I might have my gun out pointed at you telling you to get on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| put your hands behind your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| As soon as that's done and I holster up and handcuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| that has been a show of force because I am intentionally pointed my weapon at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| you, directly pointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| And the converse, if she was searching that very same building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| and didn't come across anybody, she has taken her weapon out and used it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| but there would be no show of force because she never covered it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Nobody was in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| So even though she removed her weapon from a holster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| we don't require a report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Does that clear it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| And Chief, with the new body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| isn't there a trigger that when the weapon is drawn from the holster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| that it will begin recording at that moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| You remembered all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| So that will make the camera come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| If it's not already, it will make it come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| So we'll already have documentation every time, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| And then kind of a follow-up to these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| are there certain times where maybe approaching a suspect would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| likely to result in some type of altercation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| Is there ever some thought about, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| this time frame may not be the best time to engage here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| and wait for another time that, you know, would be easier to deescalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Is there ever any thought about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| or is that part of the process as well as thinking about the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| or other things that might be going on that may make it more difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| have a deescalated event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| That is always a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| We are always wanting to avoid any kind of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| It's always a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Especially, you know, when you talk about warrants, warrant service, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| we don't want to we'd rather catch somebody out going to the grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| to a traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| We don't want to go into somebody's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| We don't want to, you know, we don't want to provoke an altercation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| We don't want an altercation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| So, yes, that's always a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| And I could expound on just a little bit about what she said as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Oftentimes, we're called in a tactical situation to respond to persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| And we'll set up perimeters and be prepared to take that person into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| And oftentimes, even setting up a call-out with our tactical officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| sometimes we will say it is better to wait until that person either sobers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| But as long as there's no danger to the public or to another person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| we will not engage that person, typically speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| So we try to follow priorities of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| A victim or hostage, a victim of a crime, a serious crime or hostage is most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Then the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Then other first responders, fire, ambulance crews, police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| and then even the suspects themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| So we always try to take those things into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| And if we can avoid confrontation, whether it's search warrants or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| even in those situations, we do everything we can before saying this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| we're going to force an entry into a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| We'll try to take that person into custody in another environment where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| a better time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Unfortunately, in responding to the calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| we don't always have that luxury because domestic services and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| intervention has to be done in a fairly quick manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| What's the general guidance for when a firearm is drawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| What are maybe some of the less obvious situations where a firearm would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| drawn to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Is the training director want to jump in on that or do you want me to go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| So typically speaking, when we're talking about sometimes drawing the weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| it's or deploying our patrol rifles or deploying a shotgun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| all we're doing is identifying situations that have the potential for a lethal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| That is to say, we get a call that we just saw heard gunshots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Some of the calls say we heard gunshots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| We saw somebody run into the woods with a shotgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| When the officers deploy, they may get their patrol rifles out or they may get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| their shotguns out and search with those weapons in their hands or even search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| in the woods with their hands if they're forced into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| The canines using those, the canine officers will oftentimes get a backup for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| a serious violent offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| They'll have their, and I would say typically you could say a violent encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| with guns typically will initiate the officers on an immediate response to draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| their weapons and have those immediately available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| It's a matter of making the weapon more immediately available to cut down on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| that on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| A little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| I think Sergeant Bunch mentioned, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| going into a business that had been broken into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Just what are some of the non-obvious reasons for a weapon being drawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| So I feel like the best way to describe it is if it's going to be felony and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| So for me, my safety in clearing a building where the suspect still could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| hiding, potentially causing a violent encounter, I don't know if they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| weapon themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| We're always taught to clear buildings with our weapons drawn and ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| either give commands or have to defend our lives or somebody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3612)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| So I think everybody was given General Order 1.40, our early warning system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3626)|
| 1:00:35| This was established to identify and monitor members who exhibit behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| contrary to the mission and goals of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| So this kind of might answer some of your questions, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| But this is like the backup to a backup of backup of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| So we have – we just went to a new system called Blue Team, and it works with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| our current internal affairs reporting system called IAPRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| So now, as soon as I have reviewed any type of use of force report, firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| report, K9 report, pursuit report, any of those things, and bring it into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| IAPRO system, if that officer has hit our criteria to trigger the system, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| sends me an alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| So there's all kinds of things that can trigger the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| If you look over the General Order, it tells you how many of those items will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| trigger an alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| But the great thing about now having Blue Team working with IAPRO, it's almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| an immediate reaction, and it allows us to catch these alerts and triggers sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| So when I notice that when I've entered this report into the system, officer has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| alerted that they've had five or more use of force reports within a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| And that goes 12 months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| So it's not just the calendar year of January to the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| It's August 20th of 2020 back to August 20th of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| So it doesn't just have to be within our current calendar year, which I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| But basically, these triggers and alerts just identify officers that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| staying outside the system of what might be within our mission and goals of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| So if an alert's been generated, I send that alert out to the immediate supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Within that alert, it tells everything that has caused that officer to trigger our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| They have to fill out a memo that I attach to that alert as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| And it kind of goes over everything that encompasses that officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| It's evaluations, their job assignment, any types of disciplinary action they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| had or citizen complaints and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| So they look at the totality of that officer, including their yearly reviews and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| If they notice that there's an issue and they need to develop a plan of action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| then that's developed with recommendations that can be as simple as, we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| send this officer for remedial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Or maybe they need a different patrol assignment or a full assignment altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| or even going to VAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Sometimes these issues aren't relating to, oh, well, it's just within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| They could be having personal issues at home that are carrying over into their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| workflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| So once that plan of action's done, they're on that plan of action for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| And their direct supervisor has to send monthly reports back to the, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| it's the captain, talking about how that officer's doing, whether their plan of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| action's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| At the end of the six months, they do a follow-up with the whole group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| We have an early warning system group that is composed of the officers, all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| chain of command, including the internal affairs supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| At the end of the six months, they make sure that, yes, this has worked, or no, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| need to continue and maybe go a different direction, including termination, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| that's what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| So I think this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Having this backed up to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| But truly, that person's first-line supervisor, they're going to know that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| officer's probably going to hit on the early warning system before they ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| They're probably already starting to work with that officer and maybe changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| their beat assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Because there are certain beats, and that's what we call just a specific area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| the city that that officer is assigned to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| It generates more calls for service and maybe gives more chance to have a use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| force incident or something else or complaint or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| So they may have already handled something that would trigger the warning system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| So we do have that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| But another great thing that we have in place just for oversight is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| supervisors have to do twice-monthly tape reviews of their officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Again, you can see how your officers are talking to people, whether it might be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| little brash or they're doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| So we have all these steps in place to hopefully avoid any of these major issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| I really think that that's important to focus on, that we do have a ton of steps in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| place to be watching these officers and to ensure that they are following with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| mission and goals of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| So just to build on that a little bit really quickly, that's how we can identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| people who may be having a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| But now we have – there are certain things that will generate discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| immediately if they do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| And then we have a policy on use of force itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| It says officers shall not use more force in any situation than is reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| necessary under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| So it may be lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| We call it lawful but awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| It may be allowed under the law but not under our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| And I can fire somebody for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| We have a policy that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| That's very important to have that leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Now, do we want that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| No, we spend a lot of money getting folks in here, getting them trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| So hopefully we notice before it gets to that point and we're doing the remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| training and we're doing what we call progressive discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| We start at the low level, they do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| We do a little bit more discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| A written reprimand and then we may give them days off without paying suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| Sorry, the word just went right out of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| And then it may lead to a – we may end up having to terminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| Unfortunately, that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| That happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| And we want to identify that before they hurt anybody or do any more damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| So, yes, we've got a lot of different systems in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| And, Councilwoman Fugate, did that answer kind of where you were going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Yes, thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| I just think it's – I mean, I appreciate the stuff you sent us before, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| there are people that are watching this and may look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| And I just think it's really important that citizens know that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| procedure and that officers can get retrained and can be terminated and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| it's something that we really look at seriously because sometimes the horror| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| stories we hear are that people who do bad things, somebody should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| noticed sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| And that's part of why I wanted us to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Any other questions before we go down to Director Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4071)|
| 1:08:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| One quick second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| This is Councilwoman Parker again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Just one final question on that use of force policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| There are permitted uses of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| And we've removed certain restraints from those uses of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| But in our use of force policy, do we prohibit those actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| You know, that's an interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| It's a very interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| And the Governor has brought that up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| So that's a good point because the Governor has brought up that does your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| policy prohibit this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| So we're trying to figure out, okay, we've taken it out of our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| It's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| So if we add that into our policy, does it plant that idea in somebody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| head that it's, you know, it's okay to do this because they're reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| through this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| So we're struggling with that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| We're probably going to look at having to prohibit them specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| And, again, that's probably – I think I'm going to sign a form back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| the Governor by the 28th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| So that is something we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| And I would add to that, Chief, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| What the Governor has said is you should prohibit it unless there is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| imminent threat of serious bodily injury to the officer, which – just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| step back for a second, I think you should look at this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Number one, we're talking about 99.3% of the time we're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| force and the calls for service and the interaction we're having with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| But in those isolated incidences, not all of those are circumstances in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| which we're affecting the arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Some of those are where the officer is literally defending himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So while the general orders themselves and the statistics don't offer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| information, we're not only talking about officers affecting the arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| we're also talking about them defending themselves against assault, attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| or even sometimes deadly force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Just to throw that in there, that's where the Governor, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| was going with it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So – and that was the debate we were having earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Is it permissible to put this in policy that we say any restraints or chokes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| completely banned and forbid unless you're defending yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| And I don't know that we want to plant that seed that it's okay to just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| you can't do it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| So I don't know if that helps you any at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| But the Governor has done the exact same thing that you have as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| We need to forbid it, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| And any insight into that would be greatly appreciated because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| currently discussing that with the Use of Force Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| which will be turned over to the Chief and her staff to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| And I will definitely follow up by email and just would ask if you all could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| keep us in the loop as you're making your decision on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4282)|
| 1:11:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| We'll turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| So just wanted to share a little bit pretty briefly about what PARCC's role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| in review of Use of Force cases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| So I think on the next slide it kind of gives a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| quick kind of glance at how PARCC plays into this process of review where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| there is an instance of Use of Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| So as I think most of you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| PARCC is able to receive complaints from citizens or citizen advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| So it's another mechanism for members of our community to raise concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| or issue complaints through the department with regards to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| So some of those complaints may come through the department or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| department initiated through their review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| But we may also, from time to time in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| receive complaints that involve issues regarding Use of Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| When that is the case, those particular incidents are referred to IAU for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| So we in our office do not independently investigate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| We send those over to IAU to complete their very thorough investigation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| those particular complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| Once the IAU process is completed and their investigation is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| whether it was a case that was initiated by a citizen complaint or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| investigation that was sparked through the IAU warning system process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4390)|
| 1:13:18| a complaint that was filed directly with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| So no matter how that complaint was initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| once those investigations are completed in the Internal Affairs Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| they then come to PARCC for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| And we get the entire IAU record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| So that may be interview transcripts, it's written documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| it's photos, it's audio or video recordings, media reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| anything that's included in that IAU file comes to PARCC for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| PARCC then assesses those investigations for thoroughness, for completeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| We ask for additional information or follow-up questions if needed to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| better understand and assess those particular investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| So once we have reviewed, then we have the capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| where appropriate, to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| We can recommend that the investigation be reopened if we feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| investigation was not completed thoroughly or done in a manner that we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| completed the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| We can also make recommendations with regards to policies, procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| additional training, or case-specific follow-up, which we have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And then with regards to reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| so we are an additional layer of reporting and tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| as was discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| KPD keeps its pretty thorough records of complaints and instances and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4490)|
| 1:14:59| But we here at PARCC also document case information, including the type of complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| the parties involved, and the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| And that gives us the capacity to continually assess and be on the lookout for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| patterns of behavior so that we can make additional recommendations or raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| concerns with KPD if we see it being necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And we also include information with regards to use of force in our annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| which you all receive each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| And so it's just an additional layer of reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| And, of course, our annual reports are made available to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| and so those numbers are out there and visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| So that's kind of the role that PARCC plays in the review of use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| So that we're just an additional layer of oversight and making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| investigations are happening and that they're happening in a way that is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| and thorough and fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| We stay in pretty regular communication with Internal Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| We ask a lot of questions and get a lot of feedback and give a lot of feedback also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| and follow-up with regards to use of force cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| in addition to other complaints that come through the PARCC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| So this is specific to use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4572)|
| 1:16:39| Council, do we have any questions at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4599)|
| 1:16:50| On any of the information that's been reviewed with us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| Vice Mayor, I have a question about the body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| Just some clarification for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| I know that they are automatically turned on like when a gun is up, you know, unholstered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| At what point are body cameras turned on and when are they off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| How much discretion does an officer have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| So our policy, again, is up on the open record page for our in-car camera right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| and I had provided that as a packet way back when we started talking about body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| But any time we have an interaction with a member of the public or a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| we have to have that camera on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| So the body camera will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| So the triggers that we had talked about, probably a bad word, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| as a gun comes out of a holster or as that car door opens, it will automatically turn on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| So that's going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Right now, if an officer doesn't turn their mic on with the in-car cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| they may be rushing to the aid of another officer, they may be running into a domestic situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and we teach them to turn that mic on before they get to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| But if there is some reason that they are just in the heat of the moment, don't get it turned on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| and it's not a pattern of behavior, we may just issue a counseling form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| In the future, we're going to look at that a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| because that body camera and mic will automatically come on when that car door opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| So the officer will physically have to turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| And that is an intentional action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| So we'll probably be looking at more of, we haven't decided on this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| but more suspension, written reprimand type thing for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| because that is an intentional act to turn that off when they know they're going to encounter a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| have a citizen encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Whereas now they have to intentionally turn it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Just the mic, just the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Councilman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| So I know we've talked a little bit about this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| And would just like, if you all could expand a little bit on kind of the post-incident sort of emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4744)|
| 1:19:15| and mental support that our officers get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| At what point are they mandated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| You know, what incidences qualify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Are there certain incidences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| I mean, obviously a shooting, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| But what other incidences are sort of included when an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| I'm just curious to know if it's mandatory and what that support looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| So right now, the only time that it's mandatory is on an officer-involved shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| However, we have a policy that has been written, and it's about ready to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| called officer-involved critical incidents, which would cover a whole host of things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| It would cover our bus crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| It would cover involving children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| It could cover anything that is considered a critical incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| and it would require a check-in with EAP for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| But what we do have in place, and we have had for quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| that is not mandatory is when we have a critical incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| members of our peer support team will reach out to those officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| and they will meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Supervisors and their feet partners will watch out for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| We teach this in the academy, you know, how to watch out, what signs to look for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| what to watch out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| We try and watch out for each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| but that's why I want to have this yearly evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| and why I'm changing this officer-involved critical incident policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| In addition to that, we're going to mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| if you are involved in an officer-involved critical incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| that six months later you get another mandatory evaluation, EAP evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| Because, you know, we've had, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| it's taken 10 or 15 years sometimes before something comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| So if they're doing it on their own once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| I think maybe we can stave some of this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| But there are some terrible things that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I'm sorry, I went off on a tangent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| No, and I'm glad to hear that, that you're sort of broadening that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| Is the EAP the only resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| or are there other resources that they're able to tap into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| So there's EAP, but also I went and met with Ms. Fitzgerald over at Risk Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| and didn't realize this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| but our city insurance that we have is a, there's no, what is it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| There's a copay, but not a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| Talkout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Yeah, there's not, you know, where you have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| like I have to pay out the first $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Deductible premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| With mental health evaluation, you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Yeah, deductible, mandatory deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| There is not, and I just found that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| So they have that option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| We're making that more widely known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| They also have peer support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| So there's some other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| but we got to get them more out there and more talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| We need to make those, everybody more aware of those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| And the one thing that I, you know, I've talked about that I'd like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| I'd like to get a culturally competent psychologist on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| So just to work in the police department and maybe with the fire department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| That's my goal eventually, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Yes, Chief Thomas, I'm really glad that you're taking these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| I think this is an area that we really need to look at and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| I think you and I will have some more discussions about this and any way that I can be supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| I certainly would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I think the mental health of our officers is basically it's good for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| and it also helps them make better judgment when they're dealing with the public, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| So I'm glad to see that steps being taken in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| And thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| And I appreciate that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| And definitely, you know, anytime you see anything that we can work on, I appreciate that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| Because you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| If I can keep all the officers healthy mentally, physically, they get better service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and they take better care of our community, which is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| Councilman Rodger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I have a question that's not specifically tied to some of the information we went to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| I would like a better understanding of how investigations happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| For example, well, no, I don't mean investigations in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| I mean, like IAU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| For example, I had a specific conversation with Mayor O'Hara after some of the incidents that happened previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| that Councilwoman Singh alluded to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| And I would like a better understanding of how it comes across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5041)|
| 1:24:10| I'm not a police officer, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| And so maybe I don't understand how things operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| It comes across to me as a non-officer that it's you investigating your own when it's IAU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| and there's no independent outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| And one of the conversations I had with the mayor at the time was to pull in an independent outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| like an attorney or someone, to be an outside set of eyes to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5072)|
| 1:24:40| So I would like a better understanding of why it functions the way it does and doesn't include something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5080)|
| 1:24:50| Well, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| I understand what you're saying, and we'd be glad to go over that maybe in a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| But one quick point, part goes over all of our investigations with a fine-tooth comb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| asks lots of questions, which is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| And we have an attorney that is an attorney, so she can be very critical and look at that with that eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5107)|
| 1:25:16| So was PARC involved in those particular investigations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| They review all of our investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| But they're not part of they review the findings of IAU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| They're not part of the process of doing the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| They review them when they're finished, but if they have questions or if they feel like something wasn't delved into enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| they can request that internal affairs go and do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| In fact, I can't think of an instance where that's happened, but as an internal affairs investigation is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| I know as an internal affairs commander, I would come up and talk to Chief Rausch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| just like Lieutenant Steele comes up and talks to me at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| And I may have, you know, when he says, okay, we're about done, I'm getting ready to turn this over to you for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| I may want more investigation into a certain person or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| So, you know, we're always willing to open that back up and go look if we've missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| So it's not like once it's closed, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| You know, if there's something else comes up, we can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| I think there's a bit more that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Maybe I'll work on questions for the next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Council Member, if I can jump in on that just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| PARC is a resource for the Internal Affairs Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| PARC in the past, the Executive Director in the past, has worked with the Internal Affairs Unit with regard to bringing in witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| that otherwise might not have been available for internal affairs investigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| making that contact with them, sitting with them if necessary during the interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| to make sure they feel comfortable giving a statement to Internal Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| So there is an interrelationship between PARC, particularly the Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| and the Internal Affairs Unit during the course of an investigation that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| So that's an option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| Any other questions or comments, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| I didn't see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Yeah, one of the things that I'd like to add that, and again, welcome aboard, Executive Director Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| You just kind of just jumped into the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| I don't even think you've been on the job 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| We appreciate your diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| I think her background as an attorney will come in very handy in reviewing these investigations and these cases as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5268)|
| 1:27:58| So it's been a lot of good information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Again, Council, I know that we all are taking notes and may even have some additional follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| I envision that we will have at the end of this series a session where we will kind of go back through our notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| for suggestions and recommendations and discussions as it relates to that for anything that we may come up with or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| Again, I also want to thank you, Chief Thomas, and your staff for your commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| I know there's a lot of work that goes into getting the information together to send to us and for the presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| And so we certainly appreciate your partnership in that as well, and also the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| I'd be remiss if I did not thank Mr. Johnson because I know these Zoom meetings can be a technical nightmare for him sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| And so we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| If there's no additional questions or comments from Council, Mr. Johnson, do we have anyone signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| Vice Mayor, we do not have anyone signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| Well, with that said, Council, it is now 5.33 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| And we will go ahead and call this meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| I hope everyone has a great rest of your afternoon and a good weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200820?start=5355)|
