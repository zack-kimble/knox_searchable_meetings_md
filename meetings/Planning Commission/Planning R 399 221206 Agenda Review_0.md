| 0:00:29| Welcome everyone to the December agenda review meeting. I would like to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| and I want to say our condolences go out to Michelle. She had a sudden loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=37)|
| 0:00:47| with her sister. Thoughts go out to you and sorry to hear the tragic news. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| this time I'll turn it over to Director Welch. Thank you Mr. Chair. Just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| announcements. One, I do want to thank the commissioners for hosting the holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| party last night at Maple Hall and it was a wonderful time and very appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| your generosity and opportunity for staff to mingle with you, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| commissioners and spouses and others to gather there. So thank you again very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| much for that opportunity last night. Looking forward to 2023, I was told that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| we usually have a break in winter time with rezoning and things like that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| January on our agenda we are expecting 24 rezoning requests, 17 sector plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:39| plan amendment requests and eight concepts plans on our January agenda so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| I was hoping we'd have a break and hoping you all would have a break too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| and the staff would have a break but it's going to be a busy next four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| for the staff to put together reports in there considering with the leave and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| things like that are going on but we we're still continuing to see a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| development come through and if you guys have a crystal ball let us know for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| 2023 is going to slow down a little bit more I don't know but what will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| prepared and the staff will continue to provide the service that we're here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| do for you and again thank you for your voluntary service to this community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| the Planning Commission and with that I have no other announcements and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| turn it this is a you're very lucky as a commissioner because only once every 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| years do you get to see this report that we prepare so if you want to hang around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| as a commissioner or come back again in 10 years you'll be able to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| report is repaid prepared by our staff on the center of population based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| census data but we want to share this report with you and before us today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Aubrey Whelan, a research associate for us. Aubrey's been with us about what three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| years maybe or is it four? I didn't hear the question. Well I was just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| remember how many years you've been with this Aubrey. Three and some change. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Aubrey has put together this report and it's in front of you today also and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| another information is about front of you today and then so Aubrey go right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| ahead thank you. Thank you so much for having me so like Jeff said we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| produced this a version of this report every census and this is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| opportunity to visualize and talk about some of the changes to our community in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| the past decade. The center of population is frequently described by saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:38| it is a flat imaginary geographic area where everyone is put on the map where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| they live and we all weigh the same and it's where we would balance perfectly on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| that map. In other words it's where there would be the same number of people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| every direction east to west north and south so that this imaginary flat map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| wouldn't go and wouldn't tilt in any direction. And the reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| calculate it is that it helps us show uneven population distribution. It can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| also show the direction that growth is coming from and it shows us the story of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| a place. So for example we can see the effects of phases of our history by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| looking at the US map. This is every center of population in the US since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| first census in 1790. They're all along this way. We can just see the trend we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| know that we grew farther on the west coast as we started adding more states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| We can also see distinct points in our history which is very interesting. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| can see the start of westward expansion right here in the early 1800s where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| start seeing much bigger jumps in this center of population farther west. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| look for the biggest one in 1850 to 1860, this was right after California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Minnesota, and Oregon were added as states. This is when the West is becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| the place to be. It's the Gold Rush and the Oregon Trail. The population is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| booming. And so that's why there's this huge jump farther west. But then by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| very next census, 2.5% of the US population was lost in the Civil War and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| most of that loss was in the south. So we see a very much smaller jump and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| one of the couple of times that the center population moves north. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| all just to say that the center of population is an amazing way to map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| these changes that shape our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Looking a little more locally, Tennessee is a great example to show that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| sometimes no pattern is a pattern. For 40 years, the center of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| population is just crisscrossed back and forth across Murfreesboro. What we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| tell from this is that the state is very well balanced east to west. Unlike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| the US map, the center of Tennessee has stayed pretty much dead center in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| state for decades. There's been a slight trend northeast since 1990, but it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| keep heading northeast, it might circle back. The state is so well balanced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| even if it does keep moving northeast, we don't really expect it to just jump to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Cooksville anytime soon. So what do we learn about Knox County by looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| our center of population? The first thing that we notice is that the center is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| downtown, which would be right about here. It's up in northwest city sector, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| it's decidedly shifting west. The patterns of population growth from 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| to 2020 definitely support this shift. In this map of population change from 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| to 2020, everything that's medium to dark blue is pretty considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| population growth, whereas everything purple is population loss, and anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| in a light color is little or no change. If we look at this as everything east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| of the previous center of populations versus everything west, it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| obvious which side is more blue, which side has more population growth, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| the direction that the population center will keep going. We can look at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| driving forces. Let's start with building permits. For 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| the northwest and southwest county sectors have left all the other sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| behind, even when you include non-residential developments. From 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| to 2020, they accounted for almost half, about 48 percent, of all the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| permits in Knox County. North County and Central City here are the only ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| have ever even come close, but they've both been much less consistent in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| to year sense, as well as decade to decade. A couple of possible contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| factors for why there's so much happening in the west county sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| versus the east could be that they're following expansion of utilities, access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| to Pellissippi Parkway, and all of those perks, topographic challenges, community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| opposition, employment options, conservation of farmland and forest, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| probably more. I'm sure that you guys can think of plenty of reasons. Some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| driving forces, if we look at population growth rates by sector. From 1990 to 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| in this chart, southwest county more than doubled in the same time period that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| Central City, East City, and South City all grew by less than 4 percent. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| actually, 1.2 percent in Central City is a big improvement because of the exodus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| of residents in the 1980s and 1990s, so Central City is still just getting its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| population back. Now we can look at what the center of population relates to for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| workers and businesses. These two maps are places where workers are employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| and places where workers live. You can notice that they're both skewed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| west, just like the center of population. A key point to think about when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| looking at these, even though it looks like there's these big clusters, so maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| people are living close to where they work, that's not the case. You can live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| one side of this cluster, or you can live over here and work way over here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| you're going to be driving for a really long time still. In fact, the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| commute time in Knox County is over 20 minutes. This is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| that is sometimes glossed over in conversations about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| affordability, the cost of transportation from that affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| place. People might be moving out to the suburbs out west because they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| afford a really nice house out there compared to closer to the city, but how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| much are they shouldering in transportation costs to go out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| Because of our central location in the eastern U.S., Knoxville-based businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| can reach a huge percentage of the American marketplace within a day's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| drive. So about 47% of the U.S. population lives within 600 miles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| Knoxville, which is about 10 to 11 hours driving. If we think about local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| manufacturers like Sea Ray Brunswick Boat Group, they could get their products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| from Knoxville to communities on the Atlantic, the Gulf Coast, and the Great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Lakes in just a day. It's one day of rush shipping. And during this time of year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| when many of us are thinking about traveling to see our loved ones, isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| it just great to think that Knoxville is the perfect place to start a road trip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I want to leave you with some thoughts about what this means for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=622)|

| 0:14:39| as well as vehicular connections in this district. So, for these reasons, staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:49| recommending to deny the right-of-way closure in this area. We just found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:58| that the Fire Department is in support of the closure, but City Engineering is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| still objecting to the closure. Questions? Liz, do you know what the traffic volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| is on that section of road? Has there been a traffic count? I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| would probably be a question for City Engineering. Thank you. As far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| I'm not aware of any specific traffic counts on that section of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=929)|

| 0:15:39| aware of any. It wouldn't be difficult to have one done. It might not hurt just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| so we can have some baseline information to use in making this decision. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| point out, too, that if it is closed, then they will have to change the name of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| street and readdress all of the properties on either side of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=962)|
| 0:16:12| When you say the Fire Department is in support, do you mean like they are actually supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| or they're just not against it? They do not object to the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| I had another question. I remember years ago when the Cumberland Avenue corridor was getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:39| redone, there was a lot of talk about, a lot of controversy about making it one lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| with the turning lanes. One comment that I heard a lot back when that was going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| support of that process was that having the single lane and turn lanes would help push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| local traffic into Fort Sanders and off of the main Cumberland Avenue. That may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| just been people talking, but was there, staff, do you all remember anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| during that process, part of that objective being that traffic would be moved into Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| Sanders at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I guess I was in charge of that planning study that resulted in Cumberland Avenue, so I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| take the pluses and the minuses in it, but supportive of the grid system was a key component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:33| of Cumberland Avenue reducing it to three lanes. Any place you have a grid system, you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| be able to distribute traffic more efficiently and more effectively, and you won't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| always depend upon putting it all onto the major corridors. So, I mean, from a planner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| perspective, you know, any time you can keep a grid system intact, you'll distribute the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| traffic in any particular area. And when we developed that corridor study, it was to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| more traffic to use potentially Neyland Drive for through trips and to even use parts of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| you know, 16th Street and that to access in the other streets to access Fort Sanders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1086)|

| 0:18:15| And my last question about this is, I know that they've already closed some other, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| we go back to the map view, maybe? Did, there's, is 20th Street, has it already been closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:31| through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| I think you're thinking of the section of 19th Street that goes up between the Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Sanders Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Yeah, and is there another section that's closed or is that just that one section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| I believe that's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Okay. All right, that's all. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| I have a question about the pedestrian traffic, because if you close the, their request, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| it asking to close the road for all traffic, pedestrians and cars or just cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| So it's my understanding that if they close it, they could choose to close it to all pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| traffic as well. It's, it becomes part of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Okay, they could, if they chose, you know, build houses on it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Totally obstruct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Or add additions maybe to the medical center or other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1161)|

| 0:19:55| This is for a 9.6 acre area. When we look at the growth plan, you can see that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| is squarely in the middle of the rural area. Ridgeview Road is even downgraded to, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1201)|

| 0:20:29| largely rural and agricultural lots for the last few decades. And average lot sizes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1229)|

| 0:20:56| unit per acre, because it's consistent with the surrounding development and the steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| slopes on the property would allow the majority of the development to be clustered outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1260)|

| 0:21:14| I've got a quick question. The reasoning of going back to one, because under agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:29| they have one. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Well, you mean why change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah, why would we rezone it to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| It allows flexibility in the lot sizes. If there are steep slopes on the property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| this whole side of Ridgeview Road falls within the hillside and ridgetop area, then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| allow them to concentrate development on the lesser steep sloped areas, whereas the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| agricultural would just require one house per acre. And it also has a minimum lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1327)|

| 0:22:46| They're also asking for a sector plan amendment from agriculture to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| This is for a 5.24 acre area. On the sector plan, it shows up primarily as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| There is some existing commercial zoning that's just west of here, and that all predates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| growth policy plan for this area. There's also a large lot that is zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| but remains undeveloped as commercial. This is the area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:24| So the existing non-residential land uses in this area are primarily in this commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| zoned area. This area, however, though, as you can tell from the aerial, is largely rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| agricultural land with some of these pre-existing commercial uses that predate the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| in this area. This is what the growth plan looks like along this section of Tazewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| Pike. Again, you can see it's largely rural and pretty far from the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| So for these reasons, staff does not feel that this is consistent with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| development, so we are recommending to deny neighborhood commercial as well as denying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| the sector plan amendment to neighborhood commercial because it is not consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| the location criteria and it is within the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Just as a point of information, this is what the location criteria looks like for neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| commercial. It is not located at an intersection or at the edge of a neighborhood, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| within 1,000 feet of existing commercially zoned areas. So those are both two reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| why we're recommending denial. Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Any questions? We'll pass the network cord on to Jesse Hillman. Just a reminder to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| directly into the mic, please, over there, for the benefit of me and Jeff Roth and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| few others. For the benefit of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:27| Okay, so this is a familiar one at this point. This is item number nine on the agenda, 10C22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:46| This is the property at 2742 Hancock Street and 302 North Avenue. The request is to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| from general industrial with an infill housing overlay to industrial mixed use with an infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| housing overlay. The property owner is now the applicant and they added a parcel to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:08| south of the original request, so they are in support of this request. We're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:17| approval of industrial mixed use because it is consistent with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and the sector plan. It would provide new opportunities that are more in harmony with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| the dense residential surroundings, such as entertainment, amusement, retail, and residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| There were questions about the potential contamination at this site because it was a recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| It burned in 2019 and was razed. There was an initial environmental assessment done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| TDEC and I spoke with TDEC's Knoxville Environmental Field Office, specifically the manager of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| remediation and brownfield cleanup. I also spoke with the city law department and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| confirmed that permitting for residential development would entail clearance from TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| and to get that clearance, TDEC would conduct a full environmental investigation and provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| guidance on remediation measures to make it safe. Any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:26| Did the applicant request the IMU designation? Yes. Can you kind of go through what is included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:36| in the IMU? Sure. I'm sorry. So many of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| uses for general industrial would be retained, but it provides additional uses such as entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:57| retail, service-oriented commercial, and residential. And previously the city had applied for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| rezoning? Is that what it was? Correct. And they had several meetings with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:17| owners and they were enthusiastic about this rezoning, is my understanding, and requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| to be the applicants themselves and expand it to include an additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Okay. Thank you. And I can pull up the use matrix if you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| want. With the city applying for it originally, what was the reason behind that? Was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:44| in collaboration with the owner? I think they are, I know that they are collaborating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| now. I think last time they did not contact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| owner. The way I understood it, they did not, but now they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| They contacted them late and after discussions with them over a couple of months, the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| decided that it was a good idea. It would make their land more available, more flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| for use. So they chose to become the applicant itself and add additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:35| The other item I'm going to discuss is number 13, case number 12K22RZ. The request is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| go from RN1 to RN2, single family residential neighborhood zoning, at 2990 Rifle Range Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:52| It's along a minor arterial street. Here with the zoning, you can see that there is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| intensive zoning across the street, but along this ridge line, the black oak ridge line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| it's all low density residential or agricultural. The RN2 zoning is a recommended zone within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:17| the low density residential land use designation. It's the most intensive option. Here in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| aerial, you can see that there is sparse development along these steep slopes. The slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| shows that the property has slopes mainly exceeding 25% and the recommended disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| budget is about a quarter of the total property. For some additional context, it may be hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| to see here, but the 1240 contour line really marks kind of the limit of development, existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| residential development. None of it exceeds that contour. And then in this 2003 aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:05| you can see that there was prior disturbance that occurred along the frontage of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| So staff are recommending a partial rezoning to RN2 for the front 240 feet of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| and maintaining RN1 for the remainder. I spoke with the applicant about this recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| and he was accepting of it at the time. The rationale for maintaining the more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| residential zoning within this boundary is that it relates to that 1240 contour line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| which marks the extent of existing residential development along Black Oak Ridge. It also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| keeps more intensive zoning along the frontage where it's more compatible with surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| residential character and where prior disturbance has occurred. The reason for utilizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| metric of a specific amount of feet for the front property line is it provides a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| way to interpret the boundary when development plans go to permitting or if and when, according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| to Article 3.2.B.3, which says, you know, a designated number of feet controls. Happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:11| to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| It's currently at the, there's like a little pie piece of property that remains agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Oh, yeah, that is the city county boundary and the applicant agreed to just include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| city portion in this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Jessie, can you remind us what the lot sizes for RN2 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| Yeah. So for a single family, the minimum lot or the maximum, minimum lot area is 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:52| square feet for RN2. For a single family home, it's 10,000 square feet for RN1. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| for duplex, it's 10,000 square feet for RN2 and 15,000 square feet for RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| We'll keep playing musical chairs over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| And we'll pass the cord on to the machine or whatever we're doing over there. Dancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| chairs, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2006)|
| 0:34:08| So, number 2512L22RZ. It's on the north side of Jenkins Road, east of Pinebrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:26| This rezoning request is currently agricultural and RA low-density residential. And they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| requesting planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre on a 1.9 acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| Since 1980, this area has been building out remaining agricultural areas with the single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| family residential dwellings, mostly under the PR zone up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| And the recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| an acre. So that's a reduction from the request of five dwelling units an acre. The four better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| aligns with the surrounding residential character of Jenkins Road, which is developed at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| of no greater than four dwelling units an acre. Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| Is the applicant concurring with that, or is he still wanting five feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| I haven't heard. They haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:36| Sorry, was that a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| I haven't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Back from him, okay. We were going to reach out to him yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| So the next agenda item number 12022RZ, that applicant submitted a postponement request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:36:06| Thank you, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:17| Last, but not least, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:30| All right. Let's see if I can get my screen up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:48| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| All right. The first item I have is 12I22RZ. This is a...let me go back one slide. Sorry, I don't have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:37:04| There we go. Make that bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| So this is a bit of a unique request in that part of it includes a limited rezoning of the F floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:18| So just to try to clear up any confusion, the F floodway zone is an actual base zoning district in the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:27| and it shows up on the zoning map. So if you look on the map here, the area that's light blue just above the OA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| that's actually the floodway zone. And actually, the dark blue part is part of the floodway zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| It just has a water layer on top of it because that's the Fort Loudoun Lake water feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:48| And then there's also a FEMA floodway, which is a totally different...it's not zoning code related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| and that's something different. So we're talking about the FEMA...oh, I'm sorry, the F floodway zone in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| It's part of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| So their main request is to rezone the OA portion of this property to OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| So OA is an office park zoning that allows what you would expect in office park type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| and the OB zone is just another type of office zoning that is more flexible with the types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| OA zone, being an office park, is intended really for larger developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| and the OB zone is really intended for smaller, single structure type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| There is an existing structure on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| I believe it was originally constructed as a house, then it was converted to an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| after the OA zone was put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So the existing use will be consistent with the requested zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| The part that will be OBF, which is the OB zone with the limited rezoning to F zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:13| as well as the light blue portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| It's kind of hard to really talk about anything beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| but it's kind of a confusing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| We don't see it too often, but it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Just so anybody understands it, this area floods currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| There are some plans to help alleviate those flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| As shown in red on this map, any new development that happens on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| would have to stay outside of that no fill line, and no new fill could happen below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| So there's a very limited area of potential development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| The requested zoning just allows more flexibility for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Any new development on the site would also have to meet site distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| if a new development comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| I will note that one key difference between the OA zone and the OB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| is the OB zone does allow residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| Just wanted to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| Because I'm next door, and I flooded too, and he's flooded a lot more than I flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| So, are they looking to tear the current building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| and build something new there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| I don't have any information regarding that, so it might be a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| Whatever they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Just a question for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Is this one of the areas that the county is looking at installing pumps for future flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| or is that further out in North Shore by North Shore Town Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| It is right here. We've actually spoke to these owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| I guess to the right of the screen, or kind of there on that property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| kind of where our current location is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Kind of that little cove between the two properties is where our proposed pump station will see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| The access to that will be off of most likely Hunter Valley Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| just due to the congestion of their existing driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Hopefully we're going to start that construction within the next 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| but yeah, there will be a large pump station sitting out in that cove right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| to mitigate the flood issues with the lake itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Just to orient everybody, if you're not familiar, this is Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| just to the south here, North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| That area and this property is just before you get below the Pellissippi Parkway on Killer Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:35| If there's no other questions, I'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| This is a revision to the Fairview Road subdivision that we saw last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| Planning Commission postponed it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| The applicant is going to go through some of the noted changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| They removed the access to Beeler Farms Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| They moved it to the B&B Builders subdivision, which is to the south here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Fairview, Beeler Farms subdivision is to the north on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| They've increased the number of lots by two, 126 to 128 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| And basically, because this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| this property is much larger, it's about 90 acres in size, they're only buying about 33 acres of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| They're basically transferring about 62 units from the balance of that property to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| just to give you an idea of what they're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| One condition of note is that we're recommending a stub-out to the north property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| And it's what you've kind of seen in red on this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| that stub-out to be. It's not shown on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| It's a recommendation from staff to provide that stub-out to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| It's a fairly large property now. It does have a residence on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| It does have access over to West Emory Road, or East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| So it just provides another option for potential connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| and access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| This subdivision, along with the adjacent B&B Builders site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| which the applicant is purchasing, would have about 215 lots total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| with one access point right now to Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| It's above our typical...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| when we start looking for secondary access, whether that be a true secondary access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| or potentially a boulevard entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| At this point, we're recommending that a stub-out be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| in lieu of providing that secondary access point right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| or requiring a boulevard access in the B&B Builders subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| So this is our thought toward trying to create a secondary access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| at some point in the future. Once the B&B Builders subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| comes back through, which the applicant has submitted a revised subdivision plan for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| which will be on the January agenda, we would be recommending another stub-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| to the south on that subdivision as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Any questions? Mike, is the applicant in favor of the stub-out, or is he opposing the stub-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| I haven't heard from the applicant regarding that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| We requested that in our comments to provide the access, and it was not provided on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:46:01| Mike, for clarification, with this development and the original B&B Builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| how many total lots will there be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| There will be 215.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| So this is the B&B Builders site, which you can see the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| the bigger map on the left, it shows the connection that's going to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| over to the Fairview subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| It shows what the current B&B Builders is with the cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| The B&B Builders subdivision has three lots on the west side of Beeler Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| so those three lots wouldn't be included in the total number of lots that would be accessing Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| at one access point. So it's basically 212 lots that would be accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| one access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| We sent this back. We delayed this last month because the access to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| was from a stub-out through another subdivision, but now we want to put a stub-out on the back of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| So if there's a subdivision behind it, people are driving through that subdivision to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| I know that makes a whole lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| Well, this one is not built. It hasn't been under construction yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| We're asking for two other access points instead of the one that would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| existed on the original building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| Yeah, which we totally understand, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| It's not ideal, but it's the unique layout of the lands that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| How many units did you say it hits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| before you require a second access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| It's an unwritten policy. It's 150 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| I know you kind of explained this, or I guess they explained this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and you're recommending a second stub-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| but why not require it if this is going to end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| 212, I think, 212 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| using one access point? Why not just go ahead and require a second access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Are you able to? Well, so we usually provide an option of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| boulevard access point, and how the length of that boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| is kind of up to interpretation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| we feel is needed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| they don't have secondary access at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| It's either provide the boulevard entrance, which we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| envision being all the way from Beeler Road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| what's on their plan is on the B&E Beeler Road D, I believe, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| the connector road over to Fairview, basically a boulevard access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| that goes from Beeler Road to Road D. That significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| could impact the design of that subdivision, and we felt that providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| stub-outs for future connectivity and hopefully a secondary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| point in the future would provide a more viable and better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| long-lasting. It seems like with that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| the future stub-outs could just lead to more units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| on this one access that's not a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| and is one access. Is that a possible future scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It's possible. I think we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| continue to request stub-outs, kind of going back, you know, to try to get that connection back up to another road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| versus only a small portion of adjacent property was being developed at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| So, yeah, it's definitely something that could happen. It could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| take some time before a future secondary access is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| actually... When you say request, is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| possible to require that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| That's what a condition would be, a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| I've got a question real quick, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| I was on commission when I guess the first one was approved, but am I looking at it correctly where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| those were attached units before and now they're going to be detached? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| And I think that's part of the reason why they're bringing that full subdivision back through for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| reconsideration. Otherwise, the really only significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| is converting that one cul-de-sac to a through road. Otherwise, the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| arrangement is pretty similar, other than going to single-family detached house lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| and the roads themselves are similar or pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Can you point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| again exactly where the new entrance is? I'm sorry, I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| Let me see if I can turn on my laser pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| It'll be easier to see. So it's going to come through here on the B&B builders and then let me switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| back to the main plant. And that's down here. So the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| access point to the Beeler Farms was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:45| Mike or Jeff, I think as planners we see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| benefit for having stub-outs and interconnection and all that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| unfortunately the general public who reside in these communities are not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| in favor of that. I mean, should we not develop policies within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| the department that we can publish so that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| concurrent, I mean, everybody's understanding what the requirements are rather than saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| today we're going to require it, tomorrow we're not. I mean, does it make sense to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| have stated policies that have been adopted by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| The subregs right now pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| they make stub-outs a requirement but they don't hesitate to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| that you have to approve a variance to not provide a stub-out. Basically the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| reads is stub-outs shall be provided if determined feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| like a feasible connection to adjacent property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| staff, we kind of look at that on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| How much grade change is there between the two properties? Is there some kind of natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| feature that just makes the connection not obvious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| Is the adjacent property, are they too small to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| be developed? We look at them on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Historically, does the development community support stub-outs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| or do they oppose them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Sometimes they, when we recommend them, they will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| them without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| issue. They'll just put them on the plan as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| requested. Sometimes they don't. It really is case-by-case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| I think we're all aware, when I moved here in 85, I moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| into Bexhill Subdivision off of Ebenezer Road and there was a stub-out to a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| development and then when the time came for that stub-out to connect to that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| development, those in the existing subdivision were, heck no, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| want their traffic in our subdivision. That is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| downfall of that, but it was clearly labeled and stained to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| People get used to having their own dead-end street and think that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| going to be a tremendous amount of cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| Most property owners don't look at a flat. They're just looking at their single lot when they buy. They're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| looking at what happens down the street. Then all of a sudden when somebody does come in, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| becomes bedlam. They get all upset and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| cussing and screaming at us. I don't know if there's an easy out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| I'm not totally a big fan of stub-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| I do like the interconnectivity, but maybe it's just pedestrian interconnectivity rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| traffic. I agree with what you're suggesting though, Pat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| to remove some of the vagary from the way it's currently being handled so there's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| consistent application as opposed to putting the burden on staff to do case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| or the burden on the developers to wonder will theirs have it requested or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Just to have a consistent rule applied would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| You know, Pat, I agree with you. I don't think I've ever talked to anybody in a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| that wants to stub out. On the contrary, usually they don't want another subdivision next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| let alone being connected to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| I'm just not a huge fan of connectivity to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| that's not there because you don't know what's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Again, the people that live in that subdivision are not going to want it when it does get developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| To speak to that too, I think it does impact the financial model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Most of the lots we're seeing come through these days are 60 feet wide, 55 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| that type of thing, and the right of way for a road is 50 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| It's a taking of one lot of one potential home building site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| That's where you see some of the resistance from the development community because things are so expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| to develop and build these days. You really have to maximize how many lots you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| put on any given property that you could potentially build homes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| Would there be any possibility to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| a planner, maybe staff, or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| outside, someone who doesn't deal with cases, to give us a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| on that at some point, on connectivity and what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| when it comes to situations like this, what is best for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| as a whole in situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| We can look into that. I think if you look at the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| Hardin Valley is a classic example. It's mostly cul-de-sac developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| going up, serving 50, 70, 500 units. All the traffic, as they say, dumps out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| onto Hardin Valley. You have very little access to the north, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| where you can distribute that traffic. If there's an incident on Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| you're screwed. And if there's an incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| on this subdivision here at the intersection of Dealer and this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| that 200 and some units cannot get out if there's a crash at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| or a water main or whatever bursts right there. The access is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| extremely limited to get out, and that's what we're trying to plan for, is that, again, to distribute the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| around at all possible. Our fiscal training does not make it always possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| to do that, what it would do to tear up the geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| to require these stub-outs in all cases. But part of me wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| to think that it should be required, and if it's not, it should be done to ask for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| to say why it should not be a stub-out provided, instead of us being in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| to push for what should maybe be required, and you as an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| request the variance. That's something we can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| But, Logan, we'll talk into, you know, there's some very simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| graphics out there that I'm sure you've seen before on, you know, why the connectivity works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Yeah, and I know that it can be frustrating at a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| scale, but that's why I ask, is big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| scenarios and planning. Planning's a hundred-year game, not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| five-year game. So I think it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| someone can say, I really don't want this other neighborhood driving in front of my house, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| tugs on the heart strings, but then you think about the bigger picture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| they're not going to live there forever, and people need to flow and move around, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| that'd be amazing if we could. I think, I agree, connectivity is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| but we've gone from kind of grid development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| 50 years of cul-de-sac development, and then when you connect cul-de-sac development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| you don't have that equal distribution of traffic like you would a grid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| And so it does put, I guess, extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| volume on those communities that are built out more like cul-de-sacs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| than grids, because grids you could go to multiple cross streets. Cul-de-sacs, you're funneling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| into one street. So there's no optimum, unless we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| back to the grid system, there's no optimum really way. It's just, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| connectivity's important, but it's not as appealing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3591)|

| 1:00:01| Okay. Shall we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| move on, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| I wasn't able to complete all of my slides, so I'm going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| go over to just showing some PDFs and maps, but... Mike, can you get a little bit closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| We're losing you. Yep. Sorry. So the next one on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| agenda, the applicant was, staff was recommending postponing. The applicant was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| okay with postponing, so I'm not going to go over number 31, 12SA22C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| And this isn't on the agenda, but number 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| agenda number 32, 12SB22C, Fox Road Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| You received a revised staff report today on that. I just wanted to just let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| the only revision to that is a staff recommendation change for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| variance. The original staff report just said, approve variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| number three, which is for a intersection grade, an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| an intersection grade. We revised that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| approve variance number three, subject to the condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| the applicant provide justification using AASHTO standards during the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| plan phase for that grade. So this needs to be able to justify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| the grade meets AASHTO street design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| If it needs to be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| to meet AASHTO standards, then they'll just have to do that during the design plan phase and rework some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| things. But that's the only change to that staff report. Just wanted to make you aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| If anybody has any questions, I'll be happy to answer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| now or just get in touch with me for the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| Number 33, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| 12SC22C, that's the preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| at White's Creek. This is another one staff is recommending postponement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| The applicant in this case is still interested in trying to pursue an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| approval. In my staff report, I outlined some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| The main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| issue is, let me just flip over to you. This is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| Beverly Road subdivision by the way. If you're not familiar with the property, it's just to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| west of Target by Old East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| And there's a railroad track just to the north of it, a creek just to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| and the property was rezoned to planned residential a couple of years back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| to about two and a half dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| Let me get the plan open here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| So the main concern from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| staff is again, so we're running into this issue of more than 150 lots with only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| one access point. So this property, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| in the county but the Beverly Road is in the city so it involves both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| jurisdictions to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| So originally when this plan came in, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| Road A, the Spine Road was just a standard 26 foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| Staff recommended that they change that to a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| road since there really was no ideal secondary access at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| They are providing a stub out to the east, which you can see on the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| page here at the very end of Road A. The opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| for a good secondary access is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| really great going to the east so we're kind of wary of saying that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| a potential secondary access point. So the revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| plan had a, or has a hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| boulevard, let me zoom in on that, where it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| 29 feet of pavement width, well 25 feet of, 29 feet of driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| surface is put that way. An 11 foot lane on either side of the median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| The median is made of pervious pavers and they wanted to have the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| drainage system in the center of the road. That really wasn't something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| county felt that they could accept having the stormwater infrastructure where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| it's located and the pervious pavers and the public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| The applicant has since requested in writing that maybe they could change that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| two 18 foot lanes with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| three and a half foot median. I haven't had a chance to talk to county staff yet about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| that option in full but it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| so we'll have to get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| That was the primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Mr. Stone, are you guys going to be looking at that revised cross section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| We will. We haven't had a chance to look at it. We want to look about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| obviously the availability of space for left turning movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| without impeding traffic flow. So we'll need to look at that but we'll be ready to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| There's also been some discussion of the allowed density on the site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| I'll have to do a little more research on and get back to you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| when this went through rezoning originally. I guess the last time it went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| the rezoning was approved. The applicant had a certain number of units that they were hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| get to and they requested a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| on the portion of the property outside of the floodway zone. It was determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| that we couldn't just rezone a portion of the property to a PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| density. It needed to be for the whole site. And so county commission approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| a density based on the whole site acreage. But there's still a question out there of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| what happens to the floodway zone on the property because we typically don't allow floodway zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| to count towards the acreage for density. So this is where we need to get a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| clarification on what the intent of the county commission approval was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| My initial thought was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| still the entire acreage could be counted towards the PR density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| because that was my recollection of the discussion at the time, but we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| get that clarification and have that for you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Mike, did you say that y'all were asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| two 18 foot lanes with a center median?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| That was their written alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| to the hybrid. What they already showed us was two 18 foot lanes with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| three and a half foot median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| What's the reason behind 18 foot lanes coming in? I can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| an exit you have a left and a right turn lane. I think in this case it's kind of important to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| decent amount of asphalt on either side of the median because if you look what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| is 75 townhouse units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| We'll have one garage each and one outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| parking space in the driveway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| If anybody else comes, it's going to be a limited area for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| any other parking outside of the right of way. I think the applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| looking at adding more guest parking. Right now they only show nine guest parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Five to the west side and four to the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| But if there's anybody that parks in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| and you only have an 11 foot lane, then you don't really have a travel lane left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| You have to have a boulevard section with a decent amount of asphalt on either side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| median in order to allow one car to park on the street and still allow another car to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:56| We'll move on to the last item, Smith-Bilt Homes and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4136)|

| 1:09:11| of their Beltown plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| You should have received a revised plan today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4156)|

| 1:09:31| I think on Thursday I'm going to make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| get pop star microphones for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4186)|

| 1:10:41| So they're proposing 561 single family lots, which are all on the north side of Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| 213 townhouse lots on the south side of Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| 324 apartment units on the, again, on the south side of Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| and up to 64,000 square feet of commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| One item that I have to see if I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| received any new clarification from them is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| what they're showing for 500, I'm just going to give you an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| here, so 561 single family lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| equates to, let me get my notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| I think it was something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| 2.6 billion units per acre, something around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| But they say, for instance, the single family destination area shall not exceed 3.5 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| per acre. So I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| with these not to exceed units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| for single family, townhouse, and multifamily means that they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| could go up to that number of units, or if they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| stuck to the 1,098 units that they're proposing, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| shifted between the different types of units. The way I read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| is they could increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| the unit count in total because they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| not to exceed a certain amount, even though the plan itself is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| only showing a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| There's still some inconsistencies between the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| document and other submitted documents like the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| A lot of changes have happened over the last few weeks between their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| Staff probably doesn't feel comfortable moving forward the second with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| If that changes, we can provide an updated staff report for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| Regardless, I will have some conditions put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| for Thursday just in case the commission does want to move forward with the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| This is the first PD of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| size that we've seen come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| I think this is the first PD that this developer has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| As part of the submission of this updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| plan, have they already been meeting with the community at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| I know in the past they have. I don't know if they've had any meetings recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Their plan from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| to now hasn't changed drastically other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| refining some of their standards in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| code or in their plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| I would say their commercial section has changed some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| They originally requested a 55,000 square feet of commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and it went up to 80, now it's down to 64,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| It's changed with the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| or maximum business size has changed too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| Originally they requested 8,000 square feet maximum per business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Then it went to 10,800, now it's down to 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:36| There's also a restaurant that they're proposing that is larger than 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Hypothetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| we heard this on Thursday and approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| What should we expect to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| in terms of that back and forth review cycle to help us continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| making the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| The next phase would have to go on the county commission for final adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| They still do have another round of review from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| For planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| as I mentioned, I can put together some conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| I'm not sure if there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| certain type of information that you would like to have available. I would be happy to put that together for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| What I'm really trying to get at is the big, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| the big selling point for PD is that it provides the greatest amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| of review, inclusion from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| from planning, from all parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| Since we haven't seen a lot of these, I'm trying to get my bearings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| what really happens, not just with this body, but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| the community next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| What can the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| bank on in terms of their ability to have access to the developer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| access to plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| The developer does have a website set up for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| As long as the community knows that that website is there as a resource for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| I believe they have a comment section in there or a way to get in touch with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| People have questions and comments, but it's outside of our review process, so if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| received any questions or anything, we wouldn't necessarily know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| Mike, are you finished, Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| Under 7.1, additional permitted uses, there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| number 8, building materials and supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Is that code? Would that be like a hardware store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Or are we talking about a Lowe's type business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| The maximum square footage is 64,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| That's a total, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| If you look in section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| 8.4, which is the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| designated area standards, design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| 8.41 has a building size maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| In there it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| they would like to have one stand-alone restaurant of no more than 12,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| but then additional buildings shall be between 3,000 and 13,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| Sorry if I keep moving away from my microphone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| It also states 10,000 square foot business size is the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| The other question I have is since all your commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| and future public facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| that's going to be, I guess, supposed to be dedicated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| what, the county at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| What are the plans for the intersection there at Emery Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| If we truly want to make it a pedestrian oriented and interconnected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| you're going to have people walking across Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| I assume at some point a stoplight, a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| light will be authorized. At first it won't be because there's not demand for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| With that kind of activity, I would like to see, personally, I'd like to see more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| emphasis put on what kind of improvements can be made at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| location, at that intersection, for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| And to encourage people to use it and not get in their car to drive across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Is it just going to be an intersection with a traffic light at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| Are they going to have any pavement changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| And what happens if when Emery Road is widened at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| Jim, do you want to try to address that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| We've met with TDOT about this. TDOT has agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| based on the traffic study, that there will be the need for one traffic light at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| On the site plan, if you may notice, they've slightly adjusted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| based on our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| Originally, proposing the signal at that location to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| because that was the main entry to the subdivision, they've flopped that around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| based on our comments. And there will be a traffic signal there with pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| indications, as well as sidewalks along the entirety of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| to allow for safe pedestrian traffic, both along, parallel with the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| and perpendicular crossing the road. So that is something we've talked with TDOT about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| and have communicated our desires to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| Was there any discussion, Jim, about any traffic calming improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| And also on the sidewalk, will the sidewalk be separated or be adjacent to the curb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| We, unfortunately, haven't got that far along into the design elements of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| because it is kind of a preliminary plan, concept plan at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| So we haven't got to those design elements yet, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| I would certainly hope that we would separate it from the road at least five feet and make it a wide sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| so it can be utilized by families, strollers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| Having some type of improvements, and I'm not a traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| but I think there can be some things done at the intersection to improve the pedestrian orientation of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| and make it a lot more safer. Hopefully there's going to be people moving across that road regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4890)|
| 1:21:39| I think that's the key. That's the hope, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| So these recommendations in the traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| I would guess they flow to the conditions, is that right, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| They would, yeah, flow to the conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| I just wanted to point out to you that this isn't the last time that this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| would come to the Planning Commission for an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| The concept plan, which is the lot layout and road layout design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| would still have to come back to the Planning Commission as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| which we might see more detailed intersection design and sidewalk layout at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| I want to get back to Karen's question, because we have a city plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| we have a county plan development, and without going back and comparing the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| I don't think there's a lot of difference in the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| The main difference between the city and county is that the final plan in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| has to come back to the Planning Commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| In the county, the final plan is reviewed and approved by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| as long as it's consistent with the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| It's either council or county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| There can't be major revisions at that level, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| They have to approve substantially what we have sent to them, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| Or not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| When the Planning Commission makes a recommendation to this preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| the county commission could make some modifications to it and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| Once that preliminary plan is approved, then the applicant then creates a final plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| and that final plan has to be in conformance with the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I do think it would be helpful, if only for me, to put together, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| here is county PD and here are the steps that we can anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| There is a flow chart, I believe, in the ordinance, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| I know there is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| In the city one there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I don't think there is in the county ordinance, but I can let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5039)|
| 1:24:08| I just will point out that this applicant is really insistent that this be heard Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| He is not supportive of a postponement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| Mike, some other questions on the recreation area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| That is mostly in the floodplain, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| It is mostly in the floodplain, but I think a lot of it is actually in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| Okay, and what percent of that could be actually utilized for recreational purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| They can't fill in that area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| To my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Jim or Steve, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| They can only fill halfway between the 100-year and the 500-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| or the 100-year and the floodway, I am sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| so about where your cursor is there, they can fill that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| That would be the extent of what they could fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Okay, and below that in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| They can't fill below that area, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| But you could grade in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| You could grade in that area, you just couldn't fill in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Are there any provisions for any other public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| within the development on the north side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Playgrounds, any kind of public gathering areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| They do have some, let me go back to the document here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5132)|
| 1:25:45| It looks like there's a pool on the map on page 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| or some sort of recreation center on page 23 of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, so they have a pool amenity shown here, a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| They do show some other, like basketball courts, tennis courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| or maybe pickleball courts off to the right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| There is a cemetery on the site that's just to the west of the pool area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| which they'll be improving and obviously keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| They also have a few sporadic park spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| to the north of the TVA power line easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| and they do intend to use the power line easement as open space as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| with walking trails and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| You may have covered this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| but hearing Pat's questions about what's on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| make me want to ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Because it says, oh, here's an amphitheater, a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| these sorts of things, how many of those might disappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| from the next iteration of this plan that we would see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| Is that a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| In reviewing this plan, if this was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| I would expect something similar to what we see here in the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| So if they had a pool but no pool building per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| I might still feel obligated to say that that's pretty close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| to what they were showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| But if they eliminated amenity in that location altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| and really didn't replace it somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| maybe that doesn't really meet what the intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| The amphitheater, for instance, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| that's not a public amenity, like it's not part of the park system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| but maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| I have to look through the document again and see if that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| something they were constructing or if that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| a hypothetical improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| They do list outdoor amphitheaters as an allowed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| in their use matrix, so guessing that that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| a private improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| Are there time frames for when those improvements will be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| like the pool and courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| They have a phasing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I don't know, I don't think it went into that type of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5306)|
| 1:28:41| So the first part of that is mainly improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| to West Emory Road, like when the developer would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| responsible and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Yeah, it just talks about lot development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| home construction, not necessarily the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| within those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| I would expect them to be done at the same time as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| development, but I can't say for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| I don't know if we can require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| My concern always in stuff like this is the best intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| but when the economy takes a dive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| which it has a habit of doing, the first thing to go are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| amenities like this because the developer just wants to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| and get out as quickly as he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| He's maybe losing money and they don't want to spend any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| I don't know if we should put a staging or a phasing requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| before you go to this phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| You have to get this accomplished or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| I've seen it happen too many times in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| You know, Pat, that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I agree with you there, but I think to her question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| if these amenities go away, it gets away from the whole concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| of the planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| That's what makes it a planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| the amenities that they're putting in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| It wouldn't make sense to oppose a planned development and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| approve a planned development and then go away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| I mean, I think we can require, I think we can require under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| planned development deal that these amenities be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221206-agenda-review?start=5442)|
