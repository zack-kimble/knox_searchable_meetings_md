| 0:00:31| Okay, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| Welcome to the October 3rd, 2023 Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Thanks for everyone being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| My name is Chris Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| I'm the Vice Chair of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| substituting today for Chairman Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| who had another obligation he couldn't get out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| So with that, I will turn it over to Executive Director Brooks for a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=55)|
| 0:01:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| I'm so used to bringing it towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| I don't have a lot of updates today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| but I did want to share with you a short update about Advance Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| As you all know, this process has been going on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| I think we began the process in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| But we are now entering into the first step in the approval process for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| I'm very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| You all are familiar with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| We will be making some updates to that in order to move forward this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| So the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee is set to reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| and consider those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| They will be meeting on Tuesday, October 24th at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| They'll be in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| This committee is required to meet at least twice within a six-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| So we're hopeful that they will meet twice this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| and we'll be able to move forward with the adoption process of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| by the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Once the amendments are considered by this Growth Policy Coordinating Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| they will be forwarded to the legislative bodies for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| So that includes the County Commission, the City Council, and the Board of Aldermen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| And then the final comprehensive land use and transportation plan will be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| on the Planning Commission's agenda for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| And before we do that, we will have a workshop with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| So we'll review the plan in depth with you, the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Hopefully you've been following along throughout the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| but we'll make sure that you're prepared for consideration of that important plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| And so next month I'm thinking that we might start that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| and just give you all a brief presentation that we've been giving to some other bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Like yesterday, we presented to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| and this morning we presented to several committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| that are affiliated with the chamber about the advance talks process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| So more to come on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| And once we have the information for the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee posted to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| we will share that out with all of you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| We anticipate that happening pretty quickly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| I wanted to—I think she's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| Ready to let Elizabeth go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Yes, we have a new staff member, Elizabeth Semond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Did I pronounce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Semandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Semandy, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| She joined us last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| She is our new GIS analyst, and we're really excited to have her on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| Okay, so with that, I will jump into some agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| We did make a—I think you all have in front of you, we made an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| We've added a couple things to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| So the first one I wanted to touch on just real briefly is 10-A-23-O-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| That is an ordinance amendment initiated by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Bear with me for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| I'm going to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| To my knowledge, we haven't had any specific comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| but I just wanted to call it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Back in January of 2023, city council had requested a study of the form-based code districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| And so from March to July, an advisory group that was made up of city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| and neighborhood representatives met to discuss possible changes to Article 7 of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| And there's a couple different—in your packet, you'll be able to see the revisions that are associated with ground floor transparencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| as well as providing standards for standalone parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Again, this is in the South Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| Planning staff have been involved since early this summer in that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| and we are recommending approval of those amendments as presented by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| I'm happy to try to help answer any questions you all have about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| And Michelle Porche is the staff member who participated on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| Michelle, can you—this is the first time I've used this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Can you share the community members that are on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| Is that easy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| So there is Rachel Craig, Janice Toker, and another gentleman who I've met, and I—I'm sorry, I can't remember his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| I can furnish that to you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| They're the community members that we met with, and the city staff was Brian Berry, Liz Albertson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| and R.J. Justice was there as well at the last meeting, but she's not always present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Christina McGrant is typically there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| And David Bryce has been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| He's been heading up the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you very much, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Do you want me to lead or should I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Next on the agenda—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| Yeah, she said don't push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Next on the agenda is item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| It's a City of Knoxville request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Lindsey is handling that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| So y'all have heard various presentations from the consultant and planning staff since this process began in mid-2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| and when the missing middle housing scan was presented by the consultant, OptiCoast Design, in September 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| In this report, defined as missing middle housing is house-scale buildings with multiple units and walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| So addressing this and incorporating this in the city requires updates to the zoning code to accommodate multiple units within the existing lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| ensure that these buildings are compatible with the context, and then work within specific neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| In the process, OptiCoast and planning staff identified walkable centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| These are areas of services and amenities where a person can walk or bike to fulfill their daily needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| There were areas that are identified as ideal for middle housing, so they feature small block lengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| a well-connected street network, nearby services and other amenities, access to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| and then properties with alleys so that parking can be located off the alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| The recommendation from the consultant was to prioritize and apply the findings of this scan to the zoning within the walkable environments around the existing walkable centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:35| So they said, if changing the standards of the RN2 through RN5 zones only where middle housing developments are expected is not practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| enable middle housing through a new zone and standards or through a set of overlay standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| So we went that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| The TDR, the traditional neighborhood residential land use area, it's already designated in our long-range plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| and it has a definition that aligns with areas that are already supportive to middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| So the definition in the land use classification table is it's characterized by neighborhoods with a mix of detached and attached houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| sidewalks, smaller lots, and alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| So that's really similar to that definition of areas that are ideal for middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| You can see that defined on the map on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| And it's essentially the 19th and early 20th grid street neighborhoods of Knoxville, which is where these forms originally existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| So I'm going to run you guys through the proposed code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| The introduction is basically a statement of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| It defines the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| So the TDR land use areas and the zoning districts where this applies, it provides that full statement of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| So to promote the development of neighborhood-scale housing forms that are compatible with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| and then to allow more flexible development of land than possible under the base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| And it provides that roadmap to the following sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| There's a section of types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| So these are the definitions of each middle housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| The definitions give an emphasis on height, scale, and design features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| These definitions, these types may differ from the definitions in the base zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| but they apply only to these middle housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| 4.6.B outlines the permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| So these are based on the zoning district, the housing type, and conformance to the standards that follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| Proposals that don't meet the dimensional standards would default to the provisions of the base code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| So some uses that would be permitted as a middle housing type would not be permitted in those zoning districts under the base zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| The process would be through a planning staff review, which is similar to the development review in the RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| or administrative reviews and zoning overlays like the historic or infill housing overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| So going into the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| one of the recommendations from the scan was to allow all middle housing types by right if clear standards are applied to control building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| footprint, parking and parking location, building entry and frontage, and streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| So that's really the framework for this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| The standards are intended to encourage house scale buildings that have a lower perceived density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| but the footprints are similar to single family houses and the heights are not taller than the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| These standards regulate the available housing type by lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Currently, as you know, the housing forms are regulated by lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| and the middle housing scan pointed out a lot of potential issues with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| namely that using minimum lot sizes results in both lots and buildings that are generally larger than the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| So using lot width means that housing types can fit on existing lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| which maintains that existing pattern of the streetscape while accommodating additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| So there is a table. It's a new table, table 4-3, and it establishes the dimensional standards by which these types are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| It supersedes the dimensional standards in table 4-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| There are standards to regulate minimum lot width, with or without an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| acknowledging the possible need for a driveway off the street, maximum building width and depth, setbacks and height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| One element here is that building heights are measured in stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| The middle housing recommendations are typically that stories are a more effective way to ensure new buildings are compatible in scale with the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| So while three stories could technically fit within that overall 35-feet maximum building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| a three-story building is likely out of scale with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| So we have the stories laid out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| The section also has definitions for building width and depth, so review the footprint is consistent across middle housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| And there are standards for dormer size and placement, and that's related to that half story on some of the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| And the intent there is just to keep things in scale with the context as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| The parking standards, so the scan that we received noted that current parking requirements are understandable for typical multifamily development that isn't in a walkable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:12:06| But for middle housing development, a different approach is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| The scan noted that there is not a need for more than one on-site space per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| And so that graphic on the right there shows how requiring more than one space per unit can make site design for these forms really challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| The typical lot that could accommodate middle housing is the same size as most single-family lots, and only so much parking can physically fit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:30| So where applicable, these will supersede the off-street parking requirements in Table 11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| There's one space per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| There are reduced landscape buffers, and then there's location criteria, so one goal of which is to ensure that the front yards aren't taken up by parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| Parking needs to be placed in the interior side or rear yards, accessible by an alley when the alleys are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| or accessed by a driveway that extends past the building facade line if no line is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| And these are similar to the current code for infill housing overlay and the design guidelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Many of these neighborhoods have networks of operable alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| And then there are standards related to design, so front-facing garages and then front yard circular driveways are not permitted for these types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| There are design standards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| They are intended to guide the construction of new buildings that are similar in footprint, height, and placement, but still allow for flexibility in design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| They're relatively simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| They're informed by the neighborhood context and existing design guidelines like those for the infill housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| There's precedent for these types of design standards in the code already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| The established neighborhood zoning district has design standards where new buildings and additions already receive planning staff reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| So there are standards for roof lines, for walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| You know, we're ensuring that there are breaks in large massings, so there's recesses or projections required in horizontal planes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| just avoiding, like, long block walls or long flat walls along the street or on side elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| There's a list of design elements from which an applicant can choose three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| And again, these are relatively simple, things that most likely would have been included anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| And then there are standards for orientation to the street, including for townhouses and front elevations, ground-level entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| When people tend to think negatively about a duplex in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| they're usually thinking about that 1980s front gable massing where there are no windows facing the street and the entries are on the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| So the intent of these design standards is to maintain that existing street-facing character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| and not create situations where buildings don't engage with the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| There are also conversion standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| This is one tactic to incentivize the use of our existing housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So there are standards that would allow conversion of existing buildings to middle housing types via interior renovation or addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| Those types would correspond with Table 3, which is the use table, and then Table 4 for the overall dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:59| There are design standards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| They're relatively simple, basically noting that additions can't be made to the facade but to rear or side elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| Dormers can allow for additional height via an additional half story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| Generally, they just stress compatibility in height and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So one element here, these are easier and quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| It can be easier and quicker to build an addition, and it can be less expensive than demolishing a house and building an entire new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| And it's definitely more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| It allows conservation of embodied energy, less construction waste going to the landfill, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| So that's one to just maintain existing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And then the final section of this code is administrative variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| So per 4.6GB, no variances can be granted for the middle housing standards, so these won't be heard by the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| However, there are instances where it may be practical based on the existing site condition to allow for some variation from certain standards, and those would be approved administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:57| And so those elements we've defined as lot width, corner site setbacks, and design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| There's a specific amount, which the lot width and setbacks could be varied or decreased, and then standards by which these are evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| So these allow for some wiggle room based on the site, but it's a very specific amount, and the intent is the other standards are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| So that's about it for the code, and I'm happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Lindsey, could you explain again how we get from where we are today to – I thought I heard you say we would do an overlay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:33| Well, yeah. So the recommendation – you know, OptiCoast gives a couple of options for how to enable this in your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| One would be blanket changing the base zoning citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| That, they say, may have unintended consequences just because some areas and some neighborhoods are not as supportive to this type of housing as other ones in the central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:53| They also say an option is changing the standards of the zones only where these developments are expected is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| However, they say that's typically not practical because you'd still have to define a sort of area where these are expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| We can't necessarily expect every option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Then they say you could either – you can enable middle housing through a new middle housing zone in standards or through a set of overlay standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| They kind of say both of those are a similar sort of option, but a zoning overlay typically takes a little bit more time to create that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:30| and there's a lot more factors involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| So they just recommended choosing like one target area to work with those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| So would this be kind of like a recode where you would identify properties and tell these homeowners or tell these property owners that there would be a new code applied to their property or – I'm struggling with –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1057)|
| 0:17:53| Yeah. So the way that it's currently proposed is that it would apply to the TDR land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| It's an option. It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| So it is an option that a property owner or developer could take advantage of, but it's not necessarily changing – it's not changing their zoning per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| It's just an option within those areas. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| It does. So where I was going with that is, is there enough of that type of zone within this overlay area that you've provided for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| or are there additional properties that are outside what's currently zoned that would then have an overlay on it that could possibly be converted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:32| I guess that was my –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I mean that could potentially be a next step. I think the intent was to start with this and see how it works and identify pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| I can give you a little bit of data. So there are – in the R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, R and 4, which are the districts that this would apply to in the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| 26.9 percent are residentially zoned properties out of the – there are 58 877 residentially zoned properties citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1129)|
| 0:19:02| 26.9 percent of those in the R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, R and 4 are located in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| That's helpful. So about 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Lindsay, can you go over – again, you were talking about the stories versus height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| And am I correct in understanding that this writing would look at both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:33| Correct. So the standards set the maximum story height. It's usually two or two-and-a-half stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| There is a three-story triplex option there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| The max building height of the zoning districts remain, but it's – the standards defer to the stories, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| So we have that 35 feet or 45 feet as the maximum building height, but typically someone's not going to build a 12- or 14-foot story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:20:00| So we probably won't get to that maximum building height, so it would be stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| And there's an additional definition for story in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| So I had a question about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Amy, you had mentioned that there's a certain number of units in R1, R2, R3 in the TDR, but this only starts at R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1215)|
| 0:20:26| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, it's R2, R3, R4, but not R1 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Correct. Not right now. This just applies to Rn2 through R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Okay. And I believe it came up at the workshop, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Somebody mentioned the potential of adding the R1 just in the TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Has that been considered, or is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Because the way I look at it, I guess, is if you're in that TDR area, it's an infill opportunity anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:55| Even in R1, it does allow duplexes on a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I guess I'm wondering if it is a missed opportunity that R1 is not included if we're restricting it to the TDR area anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:10| So just throwing that out there as an option or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I think that would be a great topic for you all on Thursday to discuss as a body and decide whether or not you'd want to include Rn1 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| I can tell you that currently there's 51 properties that are zoned Rn1 in the TDR land use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| Not to deliberate, but would that be something that staff would consider if it was a use on review or development plan in R1, where that would be a more –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:39| it wouldn't just be an administrative approval it would have to come through with a recommendation to the full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Is that something that would be too cumbersome, or is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Are we deliberating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| I think that staff would need to give that additional consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I think the point of developing the standards that Lindsay has walked you all through is to avoid the special use process for these particular types of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:10| So what that would mean is if there were – as written, if there was a Rn1 owner who wanted to pursue a duplex, they would need to request a rezoning for their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:23| If they wanted to use the middle housing standards, they currently could pursue a duplex in the Rn1 under the base zone standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:33| They could also request a rezoning. Yeah, like you said, so they could rezone if they wanted to take advantage of the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:43| Anybody, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| All right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| The items 22 through 25, the R. Bentley Marlowe submittal, and Lindsay again on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| Okay, so I'll just run us through 8a very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| So in August 2023, what's Exhibit A in your packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| These are amendments to the Zoning Code Articles 2 and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| They were proposed to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| The Planning Commission recommended that any code amendments to enable middle housing follow the implementation process defined in the scan that we've explored previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| The applicant appealed the recommendation to City Council, and at their September 5th meeting, City Council referred the ordinance back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| So the applicant has submitted a series of comments and modifications on the City's proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| That's Exhibit B in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Those are in the overall case packet, and they've been uploaded to the public comment forum for 10B-2308 as well for you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| And the applicant has requested to table this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| It's a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| I thought you were saying to table the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I've got a few more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| So Item 23 is 8B-2308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| This is another series of amendments to Article 5.3, Commercial and Office Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| These are related to the CN Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| This proposal has not changed since you all reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| In August 2023, the applicant's proposing a new setback standard where the CN Zone features a residential use and abuts residential uses, eliminates the minimum corner-side setback in the CN Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1463)|
| 0:24:35| and then reduces the minimum rear setback from 20 feet to 10 feet unless the property abuts a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| So the staff analysis of the proposed amendments is presented in your screen, and it's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| I'm happy to answer any questions, but primarily the CN Zone has not been evaluated in relation to the creation of middle housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| Permitting for residential uses in this zone occurs within Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Planning staff don't evaluate residential development in this zone, so further analysis would be needed from both departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| One of the elements here about setback reductions, the City's proposed middle housing standards has incorporated interior-side, rear, and corner-side setback reductions for middle housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:16| Those setback reductions correspond to the scale of the form, so a duplex versus a quadplex, and those are intended to ensure compatibility with the neighborhood context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:27| So staff's recommending denial of amendments as proposed to the Zoning Code Article 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:37| Okay. Hearing no questions, I'll move to 8C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| This is Item 24, so bear with me. This one's a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| So this amendment that's in front of you in the packet today is a revised version of the one initially proposed by the applicant for the August 2023 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| At the meeting, a planning commissioner submitted an amended version, which was approved by the commission and sent to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| At their September 5th meeting, Council referred the ordinance back to Planning Commission for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| So there's a new version in your packet, and I'll just give you guys a brief run-through because it relates to the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| So the applicant proposes increasing the maximum height of any detached accessory structure, not just an ADU, to one-and-a-half stories or the height of the principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| Removing that 18-foot height requirement creates the definition for story-and-half story, eliminates the owner-occupied requirement only in land-use areas designated TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:36| removes the requirement that the building official certify the utilities as adequate for an ADU, removes the 5,000 square feet minimum lot area requirement for an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:46| a decrease in the setbacks to five feet or the minimum rear setback to five feet, allows the ADU in the front yards and corner side yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| removes the maximum gross floor area requirements, which are currently based on the side of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| creates a new standard limiting the maximum size when the primary dwelling structure is smaller than 1,250 square feet, and then removes that parking space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| So real briefly, overall, some of these are policy questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| So removing the owner occupancy requirement and minimum parking standards for ADUs would require additional public input and staff analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| This code did receive extensive public input as part of the new zoning code in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Certifying utilities as adequate is a routine element of the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| That line in the code is redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Requiring 5,000 square feet, it's required for a new single-family dwelling in these residential zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| so requiring the same square footage for an ADU is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Allowing the same rear setbacks for ADUs as general accessory structures is also appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| If the ADU included a garage, there would be additional setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Placing it in the front or corner side yard would most likely not be compatible with the neighborhood context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| And then that chart related to regulating by maximum gross floor area based on lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| This creates unnecessary confusion in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| So having one set of requirements along with the base zoning districts building and impervious surface limits could streamline the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| So staff is recommending approval of amendments to 10.3.B.3, so removing that requirement that the official certify the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:29| Part of 10.B.7, so removing the interior side and rear setbacks specific to ADUs, they would just be five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:38| And then 10.B.8, removing the maximum gross floor areas requirements based on lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| And then we're recommending denial to the other aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Denial of removing the height requirement for all accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Denial of removing the owner-occupied requirement in the TDR areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Removing the minimum lot area requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Allowing them in the front and corner side yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| The new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And then removing the parking space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| So when city council voted to send this back to us, so this is very different than when we looked at it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:20| So what was city council looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Were they looking at this or were they looking at what we had passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| They reviewed what the planning commission had passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| And then sent, but we're looking at, so I guess how does it change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| And how can an applicant just, I don't know, it's like a placeholder for a continuously changing amendment in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:47| Well, we had some additional input from plans review and inspection on some of these items of reviewing the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| So the items that have been approved or recommended to be approved are ones that we reviewed alongside plans review and inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| And that's provided as an attachment in the packet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| And one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| This is a series of amendments to the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| This is a series of amendments associated with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| This has not changed since August 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| The applicant is removing interior side and proposes removing interior side or rear setbacks for CN zoned properties with residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:39| Removing parking requirements for almost all residential uses and eliminating required minimum parking when adequate street parking exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| So, in general, eliminating parking requirements for almost all residential uses and every zoning district in the city could create unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| Not all of our neighborhoods have those are developed within short walking distance of amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| And the middle housing scan that I've quoted before notes that these parking requirements are understandable when one when a multifamily development isn't in a walkable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:12| But a different approach would be needed for middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Adequate on street parking is a subjective concept, which would require additional analysis and definition, including possibly a parking analysis to quantify and define define adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:25| So staff's recommending denial of amendments as proposed to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Article 11 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you, Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| The next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Number seven rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:28| Okay, the first item to review is item number 711 a 22 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| This is a 1.06 acre parcel and Piney Grove Church Road. It's located about 1.2 miles northwest of the intersection of Middlebrook Pike and Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:45| The request is to rezone from our in one single family residential to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| This case was tabled by the applicant last year. In that time, they replanted the property and merged it with two adjacent parcels that he also owns the plot was certified a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:33:03| It's not officially showing up in yet, but this rezoning case can now be considered as somewhat of a partial rezoning of what is now 2039 Piney Grove Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:18| In the zoning, you can see there's about 11 acres or so of contiguous agricultural zoning adjacent to this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| Before 2005, the subject property was also agricultural until it was rezoned to low density residential and agricultural zoning is also common in this general region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:41| In terms of the land use the classification and the northwest county sector plan and the one year plan is low density residential, which does permit consideration of agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:53| And here in the aerial you can see that the predominant land use is residential, though there are larger loss for agricultural uses could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| This region is also densely forested in many areas. There is an adjacent townhouse development to the south. It's separated from the subject property and the agricultural zone properties to the north by a wooden privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:14| And this is the plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| This newly approved plot merges the subject property with the two adjacent properties to the north for a total acreage of just over three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| In comparing the 2022 aerial map to the new plot, you can see that the two houses on the subject parcel and the house on the adjacent northeast parcel have been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:34| So there's now only one residence on this merged lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| By combining these two agricultural zone parcels with the subject parcel and having just one home on this lot, it's being brought closer to compliance with the agricultural dimensional standards, which have a minimum lot size of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:54| So rezoning the subject parcel to agricultural would further increase compliance by expanding the agricultural zoning from two to three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| Staff are recommending approval of agricultural zoning because of this context with the adjacent development to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| And in light of the house demolitions and this newly approved lot consolidation, this nonconforming lot of record is being brought closer into compliance with the minimum lot size standards for agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:21| It's also a minor extension of our agricultural zoning and a return to its original zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| Agricultural zoning is consistent with the low density residential land use classification in this area, unlike the more intensive townhouse development to the south, which is medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:39| This rezoning is not anticipated to have a significant impact on this adjacent residential community because agricultural zoning already abuts this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| And there is an established privacy fence and mature vegetation between these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| In addition, if any anything requiring permitting were to occur on this property, a class B buffer yard would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| And there have been no comments on this case since it was brought since it was untabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Seeing none, the next one for Jesse is item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| This is 10B23RZ, and I'm sorry, it's also 10B23SP and 10B23PA for the plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:26| This is a three acre portion of a parcel on Merchant Drive that was previously not addressed, but now has an address of 2812 Merchant Drive as of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| This property is just northeast of the minor arterial intersection of Pleasant Ridge Road and Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| The request is to rezone from Office Park, OP, to the CG1 district, which is general commercial, and amend the Northwest City sector plan and the one year plan from neighborhood commercial to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2201)|
| 0:36:55| The hillside protection land use and zoning overlay along the rear of the parcel would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| In the zoning layer, you can see that this is part of an office and commercial node at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| The requested CG1 zoning is prominent in this area, and surrounding the node are a range of residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:16| There's agricultural zoning to the east and to the south is Northwest Middle School, which is institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| The intent of the CG1 district is to provide commercial services along nodes and corridors in a pedestrian oriented environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| I have the sidewalk and CAT route overlay on there to show that this is a pedestrian oriented environment with sidewalks and bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:42| There's also a greenway trail on the school campus to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| In the land use, you can see the classification for the parcel and much of the commercial node in the Northwest City sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| The one year plan is neighborhood commercial with the office land use designation to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| The only zoning district that can be considered in neighborhood commercial is neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| So the land use plan does not align with current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| In terms of existing land use, you can see there's a wide range of uses in this area, including commercial, office, wholesale, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| And there are numerous places of worship where there's that blue quasi-public land designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| In this aerial, I'll note that the most significant changes that have occurred in the past 20 years include the property across the street, where a large goodwill center was built in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2309)|
| 0:38:40| There's a Dollar General to the south that was built in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| And there's a gas station and convenience store at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| There's also a small siding and windows commercial operation across the street next to the goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| And these are all CG-1 zone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| The properties just to the south of the subject parcel are a podiatrist's office and a veterinarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| And you can see the subject parcel has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| The slope analysis shows how there are steep slopes to the rear, but the front two acres are relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| This was a challenging case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| The requested CG-1 zoning does exist in this area, and it conforms with surrounding developments, such as the goodwill and dollar store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:25| And amenities like sidewalks and transit align with the intent of the district to offer commercial services in a pedestrian-oriented area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| However, the sector plan has a conservative description of how the general commercial land use classification should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| It explicitly states that general commercial should not be extended because of potential adverse effects on traffic carrying capacity, safety, and environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| So adding general commercial to an area where it does not currently exist would be incompatible with this description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| The one-year plan also states that general commercial property should be relatively flat, and this criterion is not met strictly with the steep slopes towards the rear of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:40:05| So without amending the land use plan, staff can't support the rezoning to CG-1 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Therefore, we are recommending denial of all requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| The next one is item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Maple Lane Homes, Naomi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| While she's hooking up, Commissioner Adams, you had asked earlier who was on the committee, and I've neglected to mention Suzanne Taravella is on there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:58| She's an architect and resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| I'm trying to escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Coming before you is going to be 10E23SP and 10E23PA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:35| The applicant has requested to change the sector plan and the one-year plan amendment from civic and institutional to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:49| The property was previously owned by a local church, and it's a very well-established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:58| It meets the current zoning and is consistent with the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| As you can see here in this aerial, it is a very well-established neighborhood in close proximity to single-family residential homes and an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:19| The subject property is in the Northwest City sector plan, and staff is recommending to approve the sector plan amendment to low-density residential because it is consistent with the conditions and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:37| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Okay, I think we're good on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Next one, number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Yes, so now we have 9J23RZ and 10F23SP with Blockman Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:57| In this case, they are requesting a sector plan amendment from low-density residential to medium-density residential and a rezoning from agricultural to planned residential up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:43:12| This subject property is located on Emory Road, which consists mostly of large lots with detached dwellings, while side streets are developed with small lots and single-family detached subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:26| There are some multifamily developments scattered in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Staff does recommend the denial of the sector plan to medium-density residential because, as you can see here, it does not meet the location criteria for medium-density residential and is not consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:47| Staff does recommend the approval of the request from the ag portion in the kind of top left corner there, which is the rest of the parcel is currently zoned PR up to five dwelling units per acre, which is consistent with the rest of the parcel and consistent with the sector plan and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:44:15| The subject property was recently replatted to combine a smaller A-zoned portion of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:26| The PR zoned, this request is to rezone the entire parcel to PR up to six dwelling units per acre with a plan amendment request for MDR land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:39| Planning is recommending the rezoning to a portion of the parcel only, and this would make the zoning of the new parcel consistent with the surrounding zoning and the sector plan's current LDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:59| Okay, so sticking with LDR and one to five, is that what we're saying on the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Number 34, Naomi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| This, I just recently, right before the meeting, had the applicant request a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I think I switched over to Mr. Reynolds at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| I just, as we're making the change here, I just want to say a couple things about this particular item, number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| It was discussed at last month's meeting and remind you all that your recommendation should focus on whether or not the zoning district and all the uses permitted in that district are appropriate for this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:55| I know it's really easy to fall into looking at what's currently being proposed on that parcel, but keep in mind that that could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:46:04| Properties change hands all the time, and really what we're tasked with here is determining whether or not that zoning district and that change and all those uses that are allowed in that zoning district are appropriate for this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:16| I'll turn it over to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I'm just going to give a real quick overview of what we're looking at again and then go into the summary between the downtown boulevard and downtown grid zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:32| As you see, the property in question is the one highlighted in blue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| You see all the properties around it are zoned DKG or DKH nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| DKH and DKG are very similar in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2806)|

| 0:48:00| There are different sub-districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| The different colors align to those sub-districts, and then there's design guidelines specific to those sub-districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| The DKB, which is Boulevard, is the green areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2887)|

| 0:48:28| That's captured in the intent of that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| As I mentioned, the DK district is split into five sub-districts, and the design standards are tailored to those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2912)|

| 0:49:38| more restrictive in terms of dimensional standards, the street-facing standards, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| we want the pedestrian-oriented streets. And if anybody has any questions about the tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| and what they mean, I'll be happy to go through that. There's just some basic items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Build 2 zone is much greater in the DKB zone versus DKG, which is what you would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| versus the intent of those districts. Blank wall standards and so on, transparency levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| are greater in the DKG, which we would want in a pedestrian-oriented area. Some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3011)|
| 0:50:20| other, again this is all getting back to yard spaces and building up to the road. One of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| the other kind of unique things, the difference between the two districts, the DKB, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| is the boulevard, is the only sub-district that allows monument signs. All other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| only allow wall signs, which would include a sign attached flat to the facade, or like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| a hanging sign, like a projecting sign. Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| Can you give an example of a monument sign? That's a ground sign, so a detached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| Can you give me an example that's in that, a downtown example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:15| The tower, the former BP&T tower, has one. Some of the hotels on Henley Street have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:24| but it's now the Marriott. It is on the ground. Yes, it's a detached sign like you would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:35| on Kingston Pike. While you're looking for that, I've got one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| other question. It's actually tangential to this case, so if you tell me, talk later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| that's fine, but when we were discussing this last month in session, there was a quandary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| around the definition of lived work. Did that, where does that sit at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| That's currently still being worked on by Plans Review and Inspection, and the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| official is the one who makes that determination. I don't know that it's pertinent to this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| case, but it is something that they're working on refining to provide clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Is that a signed sample there? It is. I'm going to just flip to another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| real quick that I think will be easier to understand. It's like the Bank of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3143)|

| 0:52:38| of the zone, were you kind of talking about not getting down into the weeds of the lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| work and the code stuff? I mean, we went way, chased a rabbit hole pretty long about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| those defined uses, and that really doesn't even, we were trying to fit that project into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| a code discussion instead of trying to fit it in the merits of the zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| Yes, that's correct. Okay. Sorry. All right. I'm like flipping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| through things here. Any other questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3184)|

| 0:53:16| when you're reviewing concept plans that require variances to subdivision regulations, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| likely notice under the staff recommendation that that first item that gets read about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| approving variances, there'll be some additional information included in there that's related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3207)|

| 0:54:07| just touch on a couple of items. There's an access easement that's kind of unique on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| property that they are working around, a sidewalk connection to the school property. Then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:21| one variance, actually, this variance request for the cul-de-sac has been eliminated, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| I guess that's what's in there. There's two variance requests for vertical curve, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| I'll describe real quickly. Staff is recommending approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| Real quick, the connection to the sidewalk, you see, or connection to the school property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| sorry, is at the end of the cul-de-sac road. This is Road D. It's going to have a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| connection off the end of the cul-de-sac to the property line. That's the extent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| request there. If it's going to be extended to an internal sidewalk, that will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| by either the county or school system, one of the two. Main point was just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| get a more direct connection to the school property. Access easement. The properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:21| to the south of this development have an access easement through the property for driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| That access easement cannot be modified. The solution has been to maintain the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| easement through the front property, and then connecting to the new internal road, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| it transitions back to just the driveway access easement back to the rear property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3342)|
| 0:55:51| There's not a problem with having the access easement under the public road. I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| to point this out because it is kind of a unique situation. We don't see, usually those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| things get eliminated during this process, but especially if they're not needed anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Obviously, the properties to the south will then use the internal road system of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| to get access to Tipton Station Road. Technically, this portion of their access easement will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| remain open and connected to the internal road, so it's kind of a unique thing going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| on there. I mentioned earlier that one of the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| requests was eliminated today with a revised plan. There was a request to reduce the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| radii for the cul-de-sac. They just went ahead and revised that to meet the minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| The other two variances are a vertical curve, variances near intersections, so Road A, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| is their internal road, has a request to reduce the vertical curve from a K of 25 to a K of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| 15, which means that the steepness of or the abruptness of the crest curve is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| bit sharper than we would typically want to see, which is here. This is a crest curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3426)|

| 0:57:19| curve situation a little bit further away from the intersection. In both cases, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| they're so close to an intersection, the car speeds should be lower, and therefore, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| K value vertical curve is usually okay having a lower number, but the standards themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| the actual standards in the subregs would require the K of 25, so that is okay. We feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| that the K of 15 in this case is acceptable. There is some, it's a little bit hard to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3466)|

| 0:58:00| is existing grade on Road E. In both cases, there's a significant amount of grading that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| has to happen there to tie the two roads together, so there is some topography issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| that they're dealing with. Alternative design standard, there's only one request, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| is a reduction of the 250-foot horizontal curve here to 100 feet. Road A, being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3497)|

| 0:58:30| traversing the entire length of Road B. Therefore, that sharpness of curve is not as much of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| an issue, and also, the speeds will be lower than typical because of how close it is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| their intersection. I just want to point out, I did not include this in my presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| yet. I just realized that there's another variance that's required. However, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| going to redesign to not require the variance. Intersection of Road E is too close to intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| of Road A. That's about 10 feet too close, so they're just going to shift that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| over 10 feet so that they can meet the minimum standard. Either that's going to be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| of approval that they do that, or they'll go ahead and revise the plan before Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3557)|

| 0:59:47| would, but instead of saying or citing subject to, as per staff recommendation, I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| that we're going to have to read out these ABCDs, or can we put per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| because they're noted in the report? I think that the best practice is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| be, it doesn't have to be word for word, but a summary underscoring in particular the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| conditions of the subject property that are being relied upon by this body in voting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:22| making the motion and then in voting. Does that mean you would, I'm just looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| at the case file right now. The first one is approve the concept plan subject to nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| conditions. We're talking about variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| We only have to talk about, it doesn't relate to those. It's only about the six or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| Here you would have four motions is really what you'd have, I think. You'd have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| to approve variances and you'd have to read the ABCD or summarize as Tasha suggested on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| the variances. Then you'd make a motion on the design standards and you'd make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| on approving the concept plan subjects in the nine conditions. Then you'd make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| on approval of the development plan at the bottom. There would be four motions. You would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| just have to do those in that order. The only difference would be you would have to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| a little more detail as you describe the reason for recommending the approval for the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| This is just looking at this one. The first variance is topographical conditions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| That's right. This is just a suggestion. Right now, we only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| have bullets for these variances to numerate them in some fashion so they can be spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| of. Mike, I'm assuming that the separation between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:02:00| the current easement and the new road, obviously, that's just an easement. It's not a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| road. The separation distance, other than the county deciding if it works or not, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| no big deal there. Yeah. I don't know if, Steve, you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| thoughts on that existing driveway and the access easement. There's three driveways right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| now from this property. There's technically two properties involved, but there's three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| driveways now. Two of the driveways will be eliminated. They're proposing to keep one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| of the driveways, which is the furthest away from their new road connection. I assume at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| this point that driveway will remain. I'm not sure if you all had that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| to say otherwise. All right. Then anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| Just a question about it. Apart from the sidewalk in the corner connecting it to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| are there sidewalks on the streets? They're not proposing any right now. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| might put some in, or they could. If they did install sidewalks on the round, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:10| have to be in an easement or maintained by the HOA, the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| The sidewalk ordinance wouldn't require them in this subdivision. There are sidewalks along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Tipton Station that we feel are adequate to accommodate the pedestrians. They do go all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| the way to the elementary school and the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| If during deliberation there was a conclusion that it would be appropriate to have sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| to connect to the sidewalks to the school, could that be added as a requirement of approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:47| As Steve just noted, it wouldn't meet Knox County sidewalk ordinance. Correct, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| That's correct. If they were placed internally, they would have to be put into a maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| agreement and the HOA would have to maintain. I'm referring to internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| Are you referring to the one that's the sidewalk to the school property and then an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| of that sidewalk to the internal school sidewalks? No, sidewalks on the roads of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:16| that connect to the main right-of-way and then also to the schools, the sidewalk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| the school. There was some debate during review of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| to require sidewalks along, I guess, Road A that would join Tipton Station. We would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| be open to that if you wanted to do that down that Spine Road. I don't think we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| them throughout the entire development. Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| So we can require sidewalks given they are under an HOA maintenance agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:05:01| I don't think engineering would want them in there, but if you guys required them, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| would have to be under a maintenance agreement with the HOA. It's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| It would be an amenity in common area, something that we haven't traditionally done where you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| required somebody to put a playground in or a clubhouse in or walking trails in or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| et cetera. But we have subdivisions that put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| that are voluntarily put in and managed and paid for by the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| Correct. Yes, that's correct. That's a developer choice, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| So it could be required in that sort of private sidewalks, right? As an amenity for a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:51| theoretically. Or even, and the reason I was asking, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| don't know if there was consideration for this, but just the safety aspect of connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| to the school and then kids walking down the street, that's the main reason I was curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| as well. I'm curious as to why, I mean, there's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| a reason, but why does engineering, why would they not want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| Our ordinance wouldn't require them. We adopted the sidewalk ordinance several years ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| they tell us where they should go and this is not a situation where they would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| So in this case, this property, it is in the parental responsibility zone, so sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| would be required along the frontage with Tipton Station Road, which sidewalks are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| there. And then the only other situation where sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| would be required is if an internal street had 1,000 vehicle trips per day or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| And none of the, so that's around 99 to 100 houses when that 1,000 trips hits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| So this has 71 lots, so it's quite a bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| I can ask, I'll ask Jim when I see him this afternoon if he'd like to reconvene the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| of, we'd be open to considering some additional. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:18| And then it looks like the last one is a final plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Brian Lynch, Mike Reynolds. Okay, so this final plot is, so it's an 81| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:39| subdivision for Isabella State, space one. We're recommending postponement for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| because it does not comply with the, substantially comply with the concept plan that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| This is off of Brackett Road in the Northeast County, so West Emory Road is just to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| southeast. All right, so the property is zoned PR up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| to three kilometers per acre. You see it, it's former pasture land or agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:09| This is the approved concept plan. And let me turn on my pointer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| So inner Brackett Road's to the west side, internal road that has a cul-de-sac, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| another cul-de-sac with a stub out street, and then another cul-de-sac that has an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| easement to an undefined space, but this access easement is called, or this is called an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| easement to the common area. The post final plot has 80 lots on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:44| So when the concept plan was approved, there was a traffic study done. The traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| said at 66 lots, a left turn lane on Emory, at the Emory Road intersection is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| So that's actually on Emory Road. So turning left onto Brackett. If once, any lots above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4137)|
| 1:09:05| 66 cannot happen until after that turn lane is installed. The applicant submitted a revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4145)|
| 1:09:14| traffic study, not, I don't know, like a week or so ago, based on new ITE trip generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| that says that now it's 80 lots for that left turn lane. To my knowledge, staff has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| had an opportunity to fully review that traffic study to determine if that's acceptable as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| a revision. So what you're seeing in the grayed out lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| are lots that would not be plotted with this subdivision, which includes the required stub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| out to the east is not shown. And they're still showing this as future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4186)|
| 1:09:55| which if they plot all 90 lots, there's no density left over. So again, the approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4195)|
| 1:10:06| concept plan shows a 25 foot common area access easement to a space that is not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| labeled, but the intent there obviously is that that's going to a common area. The proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| final plot, again, shows that as future development area. Does anybody have any questions on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| while we're recommending postponement for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Yes, I do. Are you waiting for the county engineering and public works department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| give comments back on the revised report? Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| That's part of it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| So that would change the lots from 66 to 80 if that was acceptable. We still have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| concern of plots showing future development versus common area. And then the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:11:03| stub out at the end of, I think this is Nightingale, I think, road, or Nightshade, sorry, Nightshade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| Lane. So other than them pulling the cul-de-sacs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| back doing temporary hammerheads because they've got a final plot where they don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| rest of the property, they would have to change that or do these stubs and-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Well, unless Steve has a different opinion, I think they could plot the right away because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| they do need a turnaround. They could plot this and build it as shown. It's just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| they couldn't plot lots around it. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| And then again, there was a condition of a stub out at the end of this road, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| not shown either. And there's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Are they going to try to go through with this approval or are they okay with the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231003-agenda-review?start=4310)|
