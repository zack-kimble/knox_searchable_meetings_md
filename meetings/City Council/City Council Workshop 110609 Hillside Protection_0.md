| 0:00:00| And Councilman Owen Beattie, lead us in the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| General Father, we ask your blessings, assistance in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=8)|
| 0:00:15| mindful of the people in the community who are suffering from the heat and dry weather. Our hearts reach out to them. Please visit this body with patience and wisdom to listen and to understand and to act in the benefit of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=15)|
| 0:00:30| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=30)|
| 0:00:52| Chairman Hammond tells me that this may be the first joint session of the City Council and the County Commission in the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=52)|
| 0:01:00| of Knox County, so maybe we're making history today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| I'd like to start out on behalf of the City Council saying that I think there's one theme here that the county and the city agree upon, and that is that we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=65)|
| 0:01:15| the three years of work that went into this plan and by evidence, the County Commission, having voted this down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=75)|
| 0:01:26| came to the City Council, Chairman Hammond did, and said he would like to work with the council on some areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| agreement and to find ways to resolve some of the differences. So they want to see the good in the plan move forward. The City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=93)|
| 0:01:42| has had two workshops and we've had a discussion at a sunshine dinner in which at that dinner we agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| that we wanted to be consistent with the county in every way we can and especially on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| So having had two workshops, a dinner and a council session where this was brought forward, the majority of the council members agreed that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=115)|
| 0:02:06| postpone the plan for 60 days, have a workshop with the county, and there has been off and on discussion about forming a joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=126)|
| 0:02:17| So having said that, the city has 10 minutes and the county has 10 minutes and we're going to go ahead and start the discussion with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=137)|
| 0:02:26| And I'd like to ask you to speak to the issue of this committee joining some sort of a committee, and if you have some other solution to resolving some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=146)|
| 0:02:36| differences we have, now would be the time to bring that forward. So we don't have lights, so if you just show me, indicate to me by hand signal or something, I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=156)|
| 0:02:47| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| And you don't have to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| But if you wish to, now's the time to do it and if not, Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=175)|
| 0:03:11| I'm not sure where we have areas of agreement or disagreement at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| I'm wondering if part of our purpose tonight is to find out the thinking of commission and when we finally do vote, we can make some kind of a recommendation or effort at that point. Am I correct in that understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=196)|
| 0:03:33| Correct. And here again, the county has voted on this and voted it down and they came to us and are willing to move forward to find ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=213)|
| 0:03:43| utilize all the hard work that went into there and the good and to find the areas where we disagree, how we might resolve those differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| So what we would do, recommend, and Chairman Hammond and I have met and others and felt like maybe we could find a way to form and structure a committee that would be effective, would be appointed mutually by the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=231)|
| 0:04:07| We have some ideas on what the number would be and how that would be chaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And if we agree with this, then we're going to go forward with a resolution before Council would be on the next agenda, but would be on the one after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=251)|
| 0:04:21| And then we would then give them a charge, a task, and we would give them some ideas and some pieces and places, you know, the chamber has a recommendation, but there's a number of, I'd say there's several areas where we definitely have agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=261)|
| 0:04:38| and then there's some areas where we have some disagreement and we could charge the committee to go work on those and we could also put some date certain to it, but find the right structure and then give them the charge and a time frame to work within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=278)|
| 0:04:57| And Chairman Hammond, why don't I give the microphone to you and let you speak on behalf of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, Mayor Brown and members of Council. We appreciate the opportunity of being here and the opportunity of having an opportunity to have this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=302)|
| 0:05:12| Where we are, as Vice Mayor Bailey correctly stated, is there was a vote before Commission and the vote was six to five to deny the Hilltop Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=312)|
| 0:05:23| We were told when we voted that there could be no amendments made to the plan, that there could be no, I guess amendments is the correct word, or any type of discussions about amendments until the plan was voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=323)|
| 0:05:37| And so when the up or down vote came, the vote was six to five, we felt, the six people voting, that there were some areas that needed further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=337)|
| 0:05:49| There's no question there are many good things in this plan, that's universally agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| So our thinking was, let's take the things that are good in the plan, let's take those items that are contentious and perhaps need more discussion and let's see if perhaps the City would be interested in joining in to some type of discussion on how we could move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=353)|
| 0:06:10| So I guess this evening, and I of course want our Commissioners to weigh in on this as well, but they charged me to come to your Council meeting, which I did, to ask if you were interested in this meeting, to see if there was an opportunity for us to move ahead with this jointly, to take a look at some of these issues, perhaps form a committee to look at these issues and bring back to us some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=370)|
| 0:06:36| One of the things too I'd like to say is I know that there's a lot of folks here, we are not here to discuss the nuances of the plan, we're not here to discuss slope variations or grading, none of that, we're here to basically say, do we want to move forward, and if we do, what is the mechanism for doing that, so that's all that we're here to charge, that's all we're charged to do here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=396)|
| 0:07:00| So any discussion of the plan itself, there will be ample opportunity to do that if we move forward, but we want to focus our discussion on this issue at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=420)|
| 0:07:10| As Mr. Bailey said, we've had some preliminary discussions about how perhaps a committee might be organized, but I think that's premature until we hear from you, both Commission and Council, to see if there is a sentiment to move forward, and if there is, we're prepared to do that and would be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=430)|
| 0:07:28| Do you want to continue on with the Council or Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| The way we've set it up is Council is having some time, Commission is having some time, so that we are kind of giving some of our viewpoints, so any Commissioners want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=451)|
| 0:07:41| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, I'd like to weigh in, and I think we do need to form a committee, and I think it's important to make clear that just because this plan was voted down by six members of the County Commission, doesn't mean that we're against the plan and they think the plan didn't have any merit, it's just that we think we could come up with a better plan, because unfortunately, the way the plan was being viewed, it was, it appeared to be, or the perception was, is that it was a winner-take-all, and we had clear winners and clear looters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=462)|
| 0:08:12| And I don't think that really needs to be the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| If you really look at the different, I'll call them groups on each side of the issue, and for lack of a better term, I'll call one side the environmentalists and the other side the development community, even though that's probably not a good term, and you really found what people's interests were or what they wanted out of the plan, and I'll first go on the environmental side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=496)|
| 0:08:39| We have some people who really wanted to preserve hillsides for the way things look, to make it more aesthetically pleasing, to have areas available for wildlife, for instance, and that was one group on the people that were supporters of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=519)|
| 0:08:56| I think there were other people that were supporters of the plan that were absolutely abhorred by some of the problems we've had with stormwater runoff, with the damages to other people's property, and that really is a different group, and these were, this was another group that we needed to address some of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=536)|
| 0:09:17| On the developmental side, we had developers who felt that there were too many restrictions and they wouldn't be allowed or wouldn't be permitted to develop the way they wanted to, that was one group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=557)|
| 0:09:27| We had another group that represented landowners that felt that this was a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| So in each of those groups, and there were other subgroups of those, had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| I think the idea of having another committee look at this and to try to work out the differences, and let me back up in just a moment and say I think there were a lot of misconceptions on both sides of what was really in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=579)|
| 0:09:55| There was three years of work that went into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| There didn't seem to be much interest or much discussion until the plan was completed, and then it's like a lot of things, all of a sudden we have a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=601)|
| 0:10:11| Lines are drawn, sides are taken, and the gloves come off and everyone's fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| At that point, I think there was really no compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| What I would like to see and what I would like to propose is that we do form a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| It needs to be obviously balanced by people that you would put in the pro-plan camp and those that had objections to certain parts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| But the question is, what's the mechanism going to be to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| How are we going to come to where both sides have trust in that the process is fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| One of the things that I've talked about with one of the co-chairmen on this is bringing in perhaps an outside professional mediator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| who is not someone from here, not someone that would be viewed by suspicion as taking one side or the other against this, but someone who is a professional mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=657)|
| 0:11:09| What I would envision is let each side take three or four things that they really wanted to preserve in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| three or four things that they really don't like about the plan, and then try to reach compromises on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| Because I think that when people really sit down, there's really not that many fundamental differences between either side about what they want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=685)|
| 0:11:35| That's what I've heard both from people who supported the plan and people who were really against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| If we have the right composition of a committee, if we can bring in an outside mediator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| that both sides realize is fair, impartial, that both sides can look at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=708)|
| 0:11:58| he's not favoring this group over this group, we certainly have an opportunity to come up with a plan that I think would benefit the whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| but yet not put too many restrictions or too much red tape or put too many barriers in the way for people to go ahead and build neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=726)|
| 0:12:16| let businesses develop that I think a lot of us would like to see happen also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| Thanks. My feeling on a lot of this is that if the terms environmentalists and developers are not good and accurate terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=742)|
| 0:12:40| then let's not use them and use something that is a little more accurate and doesn't push people's buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| I think that in a lot of ways this has been made more complicated than it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=768)|
| 0:12:58| I think there is a lot of misunderstanding. I heard a lot of misinformation during public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| and I don't think that most of it was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| I think that there was just some genuine misunderstanding about what the plan included and what it meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| and I didn't quite frankly think it was both sides equally misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| I also think that we asked a group to volunteer their time and their effort and their energy for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=808)|
| 0:13:40| to develop this plan and they did exactly what we asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| I've seen, I don't know about city council, but I've watched county commission do this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| where we ask a group to put in time and effort and we send them out to do something for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| and then they come back and we say well that wasn't good enough or you didn't come back with what we thought you were going to come back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| so we're going to set it aside and do something different this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And I think that's very disrespectful of the people who have put their time and effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| I think there are some sticking points and again I hope that once everyone thoroughly understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| what's actually in the plan that I think a lot of that will be alleviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| I think there's some anxiety because of some of the misinformation and I hope that that will be alleviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| I don't agree that because people are misinformed we need to start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=873)|
| 0:14:41| I think that it's a good idea to sit down and talk about these sticking points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| and try to make sure before we even begin that everyone has a clear understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| of the parameters and what's included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| But I think that appointing a whole new committee is a giant step backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| and incredibly disrespectful of the people who have put their time and their effort into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| not just our citizens but also MPC, the professionals on staff who have put three years into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| Now I think that maybe having a small combined group of commissioners and city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=913)|
| 0:15:25| to talk through this would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| I don't know that we need to spend the money to bring in an outside professional mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| I know the county law director is a certified mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| I just don't want to see us make this more complicated than it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| I don't want us to throw away the work that other people have done up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| And I certainly want to make sure that we do our best to educate everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| about what is actually happening with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| I'm not willing to scrap something just because there's a perception that it's a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| I don't think that's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| If the perception is inaccurate then as community leaders we need to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| and correct the misinformation and need to educate and inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| So I would be very comfortable with a smaller group of commission and council members getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| but I would be very much opposed to forming a whole other committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| and going through the same process one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| It's a giant step backwards and it doesn't get us anywhere in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Commissioner Willenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Yeah, thank you Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| I agree with Dr. Briggs. I think a smaller committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| that could be formed that would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| two from the opposing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| two from the non-opposing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| a couple of commissioners, a couple of city council if they want to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| I'm not opposed to a mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I think I've even heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| probably the Cornerstone Foundation would probably even pay for a mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| to come in like they did with Compassion Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| But I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| I'm not saying anything against the plan, the hard work that they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| but just because a plan and you do a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| doesn't mean every plan is perfect and every plan is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| So to say we need to approve it just because they worked so hard on it for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I think that's disingenuous to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| of this community that do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| opposition to this plan for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| I've read the plan several times and just because I disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| with a certain part of this plan does not mean that I'm not informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| or not educated on what the plan is. I've read the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| I understand it from my viewpoint. But I think a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| to be formed and it needs to have a set date. I don't want to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| dragged out for another one year, two years, three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| it needs to have a set date certain that this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| comes back and works out the sticking points that we have an issue with. Which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| like Dr. Briggs said, the property rights, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| development feels that there's restrictions. If there's not this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| will set the record straight that we don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| I think there needs to be an engineer on that committee and I think there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| needs to be a road developer on that committee that knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| stuff about building roads. Because I don't know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| about building roads other than what people have told me. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| go along with Dr. Briggs on that we have a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| and that we set a certain date on that they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| to us. Any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Mr. Humming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| I agree with part of what my colleagues have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| the formation of the committee is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| key. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| it's wise to think about the process though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| as you go forward and I would like to reiterate a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| of points about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| and that is not only was it this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| length of time that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| This task force was formed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| joint resolution, you charged them, they did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| job. It was the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| the formation, the body of the task force represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| broad interests in this community. All of these interests that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Jeff just mentioned, they were represented on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| The task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| in the process of working for this lengthy amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| investing in public comment, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| meetings over this two year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| it was just, all you could say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| it's a thorough public process and this is what I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| from people who are very familiar with these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| efforts historically here and in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| It's as thoroughly a public process as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| ever had in this city or county on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| As well it should be because it probably is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| most important land use issue that this county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| ever faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| It's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I like to see, I like to summarize a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| times, we had fine people on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| task force. We had good public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| We had a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| review, we've already had one very comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| review of the plan by the MPC with overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| support, 11-2. They're the experts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| planning folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Now I'm of course very disappointed in the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| I represent that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| fail to acknowledge all of those things barely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| by just a whisker, 6-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and reject the plan. Now as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| where we go now, forming a committee such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| what Mr. Owen be suggesting, I think would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| absolute disaster. It would deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| everything that's done, all the people who've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| and I think it would be a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| It would be a slap in the face of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and I don't know what I'd say to people that are going forward, that are working on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| that are concerned with civil matters and want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| contribute and volunteer, but I know what he'd say to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| he'd say, don't get involved, don't waste your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| because they're not going to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Now the committee's composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| when I think of the committee's composition, I think the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| committee is we're looking at each other, it's us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| We got elected to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| We represent a broad interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| in this community. We probably represent both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| of those special interest groups, whatever you want to call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| because they're two distinct groups that have formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| We represent those and we probably represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| them in a fairly balanced way, numerically, if you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| count heads. So I would like to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| that we are the committee, that we review the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and we make recommendations to the plan if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| necessary, but that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| would be vastly superior to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| other suggestions that I'm hearing. On the subject of mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| that's possible, but I still don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| a mediator would represent this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| in the same way with all of the intelligence on these two bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| as we could get as informing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| this committee ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I just got to wrap up and then we'll hear from the other side of the aisle, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| First of all, I don't think anyone is suggesting that we start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| That we take the plan and that we just start from scratch. That's not the suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| that I would be making. My suggestion would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| we have a good plan in place. There are some areas that we felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| needed some further review. I think we know what those areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| I think we know that there's probably 8 to 12 areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| need discussion. And so those are the areas that I would suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| we look at, that we identify what those areas are. And I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| commission is probably a bit more advanced because we've had the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| We've had these and you all have not had the advantage of doing that. So we may have a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| historical knowledge about this than perhaps council would at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| But I think we kind of know what the issues are. And so I think that by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| narrowing our focus to those and not trying to start from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| not trying to redo the plan again or delving in, let's look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| With regards to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| and the commission being the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| that's certainly up for discussion. I would like to see us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| And let me also say this. I was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| for over a year and a half on an efficiency panel as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| We spent a lot of time, many hours. We even had subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| And we met weekly for over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| and brought a document to the mayor at that time and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| We thought it was a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| We thought we put a lot of time and effort into this, which we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| But when the mayor and the commission received it, they looked at it, they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| questions, and they wanted to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Yes, we had spent quite a bit of time, but we didn't take the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| this is our document and these were citizens and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| spent a lot of time and effort and there's no room for improvement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| They took that document and they made improvements and there were some of the things they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| didn't do, some of the recommendations that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I was also a member appointed by Mayor Haslam and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Mayor Ragsdale at the time to again look at some other things of joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| ways of efficiencies. We met for several months on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| almost on a weekly basis with some citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Vice Mayor Brown at that time was on that committee. We came back with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| and I believe of a dozen recommendations, maybe two were finally adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Ten of them weren't. I still didn't feel like my work was in vain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| because we at least presented some things for their consideration. I say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| because any document that is presented is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| differences of opinion. This is what we have here. We've got basically a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| There are a few areas where we have some differences of opinion. Suggestion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| that let's work on those few areas so that we can have a document and move forward with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| rather than just saying, okay, it's voted down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| now let's forget it. I think that there's a mechanism for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| I would be in favor of looking at a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| very much like the idea of a mediator. Mr. Bailey and I suggested about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| a chairperson of this committee that would have that trust, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| have that type of skill, that would not have any vested interest at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| but that that would be the person who would chair this type of committee that would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| be viewed as a political person but would be viewed as a person that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| fair and be interested in bringing the persons together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| So, Mr. Bailey, I'll turn it over to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1676)|
| 0:28:12| I agree with a number of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| that have been made by Ms. Broyles and Tony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and I feel, you know, we're in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| where we are elected officials and this group has put together a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| I think that it's basically a good plan. I think there are areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| that need to be looked at. I know we've been inundated with both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| sides from the standpoint of what's wrong with the plan, what's right with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| and from a very simplistic viewpoint, what I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| is what these specific points are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| seem to be the sticking points and it seems to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| between county commission and city council that we ought to be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| that ought to be that committee to look at them and to hash them out and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| make decisions based on what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| I think to form another committee with quote outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| folks I think is just going to be detrimental to the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I think that we're the ones that need to look at what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| understand the plan thoroughly, understand what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| problems are and then move forward with that. So what I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| is a committee made up of commission and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| and let us work it out and get it done and put a time frame on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| also on that. But again I would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| we've had a group of individuals who have spent three years working at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| going through it very thoroughly and they presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| it to us, we're the elected officials and we need to make the decisions and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| on with that. Thank you. Mayor Brown. Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Those are some very good statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| and you made a mention of a number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| you and Chairman Herrmann had. What number did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| think in terms of a committee composed of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| council and commission? What numbers did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| What we had discussed is to come up with a credible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| individual from the community who has the community's trust to be the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and then we were going to allow each council and commissioner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| appoint a representative and it would be the responsibility of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| member to select someone who would be open minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and would look at this plan as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| and come back and we would give them a charge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| take certain issues and to go after the issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| we disagree on and try to resolve those or go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| the issues that we agree upon and to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| But to come back with a single proposal or to come back with as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| areas that we could agree upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| as possible. And I'll just say this, I said this in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| opening remarks, we're here today because the county commission has had a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| The elected officials have voted 6 to 5 to reject it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| and like Commissioner Briggs said, that doesn't mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| the whole thing is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| or that, but that they came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and they said they would like for us to join with them to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| be consistent and go forward. And the city council on the other hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| has had numerous discussions, two workshops, a council dinner and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| we've had it on the agenda and had some discussion on it. A majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| council members decided that we would have this workshop with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| and form some type of committee going forward to find ways to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| what took three years coming forward. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| what I think we ought to try to do is get to the discussion of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| kind of a committee we're going to form and to give them a charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| and to give them some areas that we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| we agree upon or disagree upon and give them a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| and set it in motion. Well I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| a committee composed of commissioners and council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| because we already have that task force is met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| and I think that the community is looking for leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| from the elected officials and I would think that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| be better to have a small committee, that's why I asked my question, I was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| that you wanted to have a committee composed of council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| commissioners, that's what I would be in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Any other council members? Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, we've heard a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| good suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Okay, alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| We've had a lot of good suggestions, a lot of discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Obviously the commission has voted and they've had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| of public input and I think that you all are really pretty clear on what the sticking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| points are. Council has not yet voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We may have sticking points or we may not have sticking points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| but I think we all agree that it would be in the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| interest of the entire community if both the commission and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| had the same plan, one plan to fit everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| So what I would like to suggest is that going along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| with Mayor Brown, that it needs to be council members and commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| who are elected, but let the commission go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| with identifying their sticking points, let council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| vote and see if we have sticking points or don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and then at that time have a committee that would look at the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| the likenesses and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Because until council votes, the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| of the city of Knoxville really are disenfranchised in knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| how their elected officials stand on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Councilman Delavope? Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| Let me step back one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| steps. I mean, what I see we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| front of us is the work of a body that tried to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| together good practices to protect hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| views, water quality. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| may be a different question and I think that booklet and that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| certainly has in one place a lot of wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| and useful information. The question that I think we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| address here, either here today or some other day is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| what do we want to do with that? Do we want to put it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| a plan that has some over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| viewing kind of governance or do we want to take that and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| where are the regulatory gaps and where do we apply our muscle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| In other words, before we can decide what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| vehicle that takes us some place, I think we should ask the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| ourselves in this group of where do we want to go? I mean, I think if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| talk to the citizens generally, they don't want to see their houses wash away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| from bad development. They don't want to see the hillsides destroyed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| bad development. They don't want to see things go awry. On the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| they don't want to lose their property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Those things are all issues grappled somewhat in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| foundation of the plan, but it might be useful for us to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| what we're doing. Are we going to clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| this plan and deal with the 7, 8, 10, 12 sticking points, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| the number you all agree on is and have a plan that then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| goes some place like into the general plan of 2033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| or are we going to agree what as legislators needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| to be done to provide the best protection we can for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| the resources we think are precious without stepping on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| too many property rights and toes that are important to respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| In terms of picking the vehicle, I think we should also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| discuss a little bit what do we think that we really need to do at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| the day. Are we just going to vote up a plan or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| a plan with modifications or are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| take a different approach which is perhaps to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| where are there gaps in our regulatory scheme that we need to shore up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| in light of the information we have. For what it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| it's sort of like in order to know where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| how you're going to get there, you need to know where you want to end up. I think we should have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| as part of the process we're tackling. Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Let me just say this as a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| I encourage our body to have an up or down vote. I brought that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| two or three times and I know other council members did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| We decided to join the county commission in this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and to find a joint committee that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| forward and come back with proposals to each body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and then we would pick it up and go from there. So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I think what we need to do is decide what type of committee we're going to form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| And I think we ought to speak to that issue, Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Mr. Smith, you had a comment? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| Yes, we are elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| officials, every one of us. Yes, we can make decisions. I have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| problem with that. We make decisions every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| I think in looking at the big picture, sort of like what Nick was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| here's what I struggle with, council people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| commissioners. How many of us have ever developed a subdivision? I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| Dwayne. Dwayne is probably the closest one that really gets his hands on it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So how qualified are we? I look out here at Dave Vandegrift. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| the highest respect for him, Mike Carberry and the people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| MPC. We as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| can be that. But I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| robbing ourselves. If we still don't have the experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| they don't have to be a voting member, but we still need to bring some of them at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| on both sides. Because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| I'm a developer and I develop every single day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| you all are fixing to come up with some regulation, I can say, guys, that will just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| not work. Or if it does, here's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| I just want to be able to make an educated vote. I don't want us to go through and do the plan and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| pass it out and then other people say, well, guys, we just can't build with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| or we can't develop land with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| I want to have them at the table. I think we'd be cheating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| the right type of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| if we didn't. And I'd like to have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| as voting members. I mean, they're experts. I'm not an expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| by any means. And that's at the bottom of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| Just like, Nick, what you said at the end of the day. Is it something we can walk away with, something we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| that we're proud with? Or if we say, you know, I can make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| but I'd rather make that decision with the professionals to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| right there at any time that we may have any of those sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| If I could just kind of do a straw poll of commission here. This is a non-binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| vote. I'll get to you in just a second. How many of you are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| in forming, we'll talk about the makeup of a committee. How many of you are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| in forming a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I mean, I'm just saying a committee. We'll talk about the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| later. But are you in favor of a committee, whether it be council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| commissioners together? I mean, I'm just interested. How many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| It depends. Well, I mean, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| there another vehicle? Yeah, I mean, right now the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| on the table is forming a committee. Now, we can talk about the nuances of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| I'm just kind of wondering what your thoughts are. Are you in favor of a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| and we can talk about the structure of it? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| So the majority would be, is there any opposition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| idea of a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| I'm not going to vote. I'm not going to say yes or no because I don't know what other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| there are. Whether or not I think a committee is a good idea or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| depends on if it's council and commission or if it's going to be all developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| So I guess that what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| is that the majority feels that a committee, that you would be in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| of looking at a committee. So I guess the next question would be then, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| be in favor of a committee? And we're not voting today. This is just your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and opinions. We would have to bring this before us in our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| How many of you would want to have commission and council form that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| So in other words, the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| would be members of council. So in other words, we would not have any outside people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| but the committee would be council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| This is why it takes a little while for us folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Just bear with us here. I was going to say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| suggestion has been made that this committee be the 11 members of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| the 9 members of city council. Would you be in favor of that concept of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| committee being the council and the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| So we have 2 who say yes, 3 would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Let me say the reason why. I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Commissioner Smith say that we need experts and I'll agree with that, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| those experts to be voting members of something, I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| commission and council are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| that are going to vote on the plan when it's finished. So those are probably the ones that ought to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| with it. That way it can be voted up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| What about the rest? So 3 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| 3 commissioners have said they would be in favor of the commission and the council acting as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| the committee. What about the rest? Of the ones who are here? Yeah. We're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| some people. So I'm wondering, the rest of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| speak, Mr. Hammond, please? Just a second, Commissioner. What I want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| is about this. You will have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I've asked you all to, if you all have anything else you want to add. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| that 9 and 11 is not workable myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| I doubt that we could come to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| among ourselves that would satisfy our constituents both inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| the city and beyond the city. Of 20, I don't think 20 is workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| So you're saying you would be in favor of the 11 and the 9, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| two bodies acting as the committee? No, I say that I would not be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| It's unwieldy. Too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| So Mr. Briggs and Mr. Omby, you don't want to weigh in on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2580)|
| 0:43:16| So you would be in favor of having commissioners and council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Okay, now I've got that done. I've got it in my mind. Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you. My concern, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| with Ed, 11 and 9 is too many. So if we shrink it down, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| But still, it needs to be commissioners and council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| making up the committee. And as far as having experts, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| experts on the task force. We had MPC experts on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| task force. We had developers on the task force. There will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| plenty of time for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| public input and for people to come and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| what they think, who can provide input without having to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| a member of the committee. And I certainly hope that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| want to make a committee of just one group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| I hope that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| I just really, I object to one side or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| if you want to take sides on this, saying that that needs to be the makeup of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| the committee. There are a lot of things to consider besides just whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| someone can build a subdivision on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| So I agree with Ed, 11 and 9 is too many, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| the people serving on the committee need to be council and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Commissioner Norman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| I don't particularly have a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| 11 and 9 since we've sat on a body that had 19 for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| and years and we seem to do okay with that. So one more person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| not that big a deal. If we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| excuse me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| talk about the problem of shrinking the size of that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| then that's another kettle of worms. How are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| going to choose that shrunk committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| and I think it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| to entail what Ms. Palmer said and that is a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| a prior vote by the council. So if the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| votes and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| on record positions on the council then maybe we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| those two votes to compose the committee. That might be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I still think it's workable to have 20, to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| all of us there at the table and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I totally agree with Amy that prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| the whole process of review through the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| force and through the MPC, numerous experts. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| we represent the people, we need to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| and make a decision and I think we can do that as a body, the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| Mr. Briggs. I just have a procedural question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| with whatever we decide on. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| problems that we ran in when we voted on this is that it was either up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| with no modifications. When the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| whatever the composition is, is finished and they bring it back to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| and they bring it back to the county commission, will this be an up or down vote with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| modifications again? Or what will we do? Because that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| the choice we had, is either take it or leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| That was a fallacious statement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| process of our vote. We always have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| to amend. We could have amended the plan with a positive vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| but it was supposedly, that affected the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| people voted as if we could not amend the plan unless the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| was rejected. Well I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| what I'm saying is that because we're going through a slightly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| process this time when the plan comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| will we be at the same point where the only way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| can amend, and I'm taking what Tony said here, the only way we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| amending it is if we passed it and then had to amend it. We wouldn't be able to amend it when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| came back. Is that what the process will be this time? In other words, it will be an up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| vote again. I would say no. I mean all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| is, I wouldn't be afraid of the committee no matter which way it was stacked. I mean they're going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| back with some information and some proposals and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| areas of agreement and that would just be simply presented to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| county commission and to the city council and then our body will pick it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| and go with it and we'll deliberate on it and ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| we'll vote on the plan with the inclusion or exclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| of the recommendations and the same for you. It would just be a way for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| to modify the plan. You see part of it was we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| have that option the last time. I mean we couldn't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| So this is outside of what the MPC has given us and I'd just like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| Mr. Swanson if he could here for a comment. I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| wiggling a little bit. Because there are some limitations on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| you're able to do. What you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| is an amendment to the general plan and when we have an amendment to the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| plan that comes from MPC, your only option is to vote it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| or vote it down. You do not have anymore because of state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| you do not have anymore of the opportunity to amend that. But what you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| that's not to say that you can't come up with a different plan. You can't come up with a different plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| It's just the procedurally what you have to do to accomplish that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| if there were whatever the committee were composed of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| or whether it's composed of both of these legislative bodies, if you all could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| come to an agreement with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| is comprised of a lot of what's already there plus some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| changes to what's already there that you all would find acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| then you can have your own plan. That's really creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| your own plan. So you create that plan. You simply send it to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| for its recommendations and then it comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| for a vote at that point. But then you've created your own plan. You always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| have the opportunity to create your own plan. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| what this process would contemplate would be creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| your own plan to send to MPC and then vote on yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| What I'm gathering though is I don't sense consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| on the make up. I think people agree on the committee concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| but the consensus on how that committee make up I don't get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| unless I'm misreading. Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| Anybody else have any? Well I guess Mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| I'm not getting consensus from our folks as to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| composition of a committee. So do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| need some more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Well I'm not married to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| each council member picking a representative and each commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| picking a representative. I think there would be some accountability there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| for whomever you pick you'd be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| them being fair and balanced and trying to achieve our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| And I know when Mr. Shouse says that it's a large committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| it is. But they could break it down into subcommittees, take what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| where we think we have areas of agreement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| the subcommittees in a very fast way could come back and convene and ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| put a proposal together that could be given back to the county commission and to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| council and then we'll do what we want to from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| point on. Either way I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| there's going to be some good achieved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| because I think there is a lot of common ground so we just need to find the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| structure of committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| ask them to go and figure out what the sticky issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| are and what we agree on and bring it back to us in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| timely fashion. We postponed it for 60 days and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| would say this committee could act in 60 to 90 days and we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| some clear definition of what the community would like to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| and that the good of the work wouldn't be thrown away. Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| I guess I agree with my colleagues on this end of the table and some of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| colleagues across the way that have said that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| plan had a lot of citizen input as it went forward both in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| the composition of the task force and the citizens that came to the public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and I think it's time for those of us around this table who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| elected to, as Mr. DelaVolpe likes to say, wrestle with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| I think that's what we're charged to do. I think expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| testimony or expert assistance could be called in by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| a group of councilmen and commissioners at any time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| there are questions. I don't think they need to be voting members at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| I think we've done that as part of the task force and I think it's up to us. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| responsibility is on us to make this decision. My sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| is, for me, the decision on the table is do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| try to wrestle with this with 20 of us or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| do we try to wrestle with a smaller group and bring it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Part of me says that although 20 might be possible, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| coordinating 20 schedules, it's doubtful that we would ever have all 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| of us around the table. Certainly we're not able to tonight. People have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| other commitments and that maybe a smaller committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| body but made up of an equal number of commissioners and councilmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| could work on this and bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| a recommendation. I think what I've heard tonight is that there's a lot of good in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| and no one wants to throw out the baby with the bathwater. But there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| issues where there is great division in the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| many of us want to come to a place where there's better consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| One thing I would like to add too is as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| can tell, we have been through many hours of hillside on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| commission side. It's a very emotional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| I would suggest that if we move forward with the commission and the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| that we have a mediator for lack of a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| a chairperson who is not myself or Mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| but we have someone who is impartial to chair the meeting. I think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| be vital if we decide to go forward with both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| So I would make that recommendation that this impartial mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| type person be brought in to chair these meetings as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| forward. Because again, having been through it for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| many hours, when you're talking about people's property, they tend to get a little emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| So we want to make sure that we're handling things in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| proper fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Maybe the term mediator is one that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| throwing some wrinkles. Maybe a facilitator is what we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Because mediator to me means that somebody sits down and gets the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| sides to stop wrestling and come to some kind of an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Whereas a facilitator can help the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| subcommittees or whatever develops work effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| I personally would be a lot more comfortable with the term facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| than mediator. Because if you have a mediator, ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| somebody feels like they've lost. Regardless of how good the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| mediator is. Mayor Brown? I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| agreeable with a smaller number. I'm going to make a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| of a number of seven. That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| With the vice mayor and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| chairman appointing individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| from the commission and the council. That's just a suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| number. Because I think a smaller is definitely better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| in something like this. And can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| something done in a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| That's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Seven's been thrown out. So we could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| with a seven or a ten or whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We could do a four and four with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| a facilitator or something. Doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Is that agreeable? Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Yes, I've been listening to this and trying to sort it out a bit. There's two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| that kind of bother me. And one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| that's bothered me the whole time is the lack of clarity on what the city council position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| The county's already voted on it. We know it was six to five. We know it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| very close. I don't really know how my colleagues on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| city council actually feel until we vote. So how we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| select a representative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| out of my colleagues to me would be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| to do. How would we balance a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| smaller committee when we don't even know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| we're voting? What I'd recommended earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| at the last council meeting was let's go ahead and have an up and down vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| first reading. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| it wouldn't take effect. But at least we would have some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| about how each other's felt. So to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| that's kind of a problem here is that we're trying to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| a committee of city council people that's balanced. A smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| committee when we really don't have any clarity on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| how our feelings are on that. On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| issue of the size of the committee, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| got to weigh a larger committee of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| entire bodies which could be cumbersome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| or a smaller committee that may or may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| not be representative. The trick is if you get a smaller committee, how do you choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| a committee that you can be assured of is representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| As far as moving forward with a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| my leanings would be to go with the full council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| and full commission. It would be more cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| But I think that's the way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| weighing it out that way. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| the issues of representative viewpoints, I'd rather just have the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| committee out there including everyone. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| really don't think that we should have experts as voting members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| of the committee. I mean we've had experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| we've reviewed. But the other thing also is the committee would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| options to bring forth experts as they were needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| Individual committee members could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| we could individually contact experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| if we had questions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I don't have any concrete solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| to all this, but that's my viewpoints after hearing all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Thank you. Councilman Roddy. Thank you Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I agree and I disagree with a couple of things that Councilman Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| has said. I think the idea of having an up or down vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| council for the purpose of putting council members into a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| and categorizing them as being for or against is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| difficult. As Commissioner Broyles said, I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| it's fair to categorize people as pro-development or pro-environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| or anti-development or anti-environment. It's much more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| than that. If I were to vote against the plan because of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| concern that I don't want development to be more difficult in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| than it is in the county, and that's my reasoning, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| somehow I'm still categorized as voting against the plan. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| that's been my concern about bringing it up for a council vote and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| to put a tag on everybody's forehead. That being said, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| the politics of the appointment and if Chairman Hammond and Vice Mayor Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| are asked to appoint a group of 7, as Mayor Brown suggested, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| a group of 10, then all of a sudden you get into very real politics of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| well, who do you choose and are you stacking the deck? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| as much as I think a smaller group might be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| and have a better shot at this, perhaps within the reality of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| political sphere, we need to have all 20 of us around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Councilman Griep. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| The concern that I have is that, and again I go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| we're all accountable as elected officials and this is such an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| important issue that all of us should be concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| and I would be concerned if I were not on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| that there were 7 people there talking and I need to be able to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| to my constituents what's going on and I need to be able to report to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| exactly what's going on at these different meetings. And I really think that it ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| to be a joint committee of County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| and of City Council. And that way those folks that can make it, they can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| it. If they can't, they can't. But it gives all of us at least the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| to hear what everyone has to say firsthand. I think one of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| that I've learned through this whole ordeal about this particular issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| he says, she says, he says, she says, who says what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| And if I can hear it myself in terms of what, if Ed Schaus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| has something to say, I want to hear it from Ed Schaus. I don't want to hear it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Joe Neighbor down the street that Ed said such and such. And so I think there's a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| advantage of having this done. I think the other thing too is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| we ought to say shame on us if we can't get together and do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| and do this quickly. I think this has gone on long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| and I think we have an opportunity to come to some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| The other thing that I wanted to say is that just from an aside, I really appreciate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| that County Commission and City Council are getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| on a very critical issue that affects all of us. You folks drain into us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| those hillsides and those ridgetops. We look at those and I think it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| important that we do work together on this. But I think all of us need to come to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| as elected officials, listen to what the sticking points are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| make decisions and therefore proceed on that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| I would be, and I appreciate the suggestion Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| I would be hesitant to select four of our members to serve on a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| I think that if we're going to go with members of Commission, everybody should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| So I would be in favor of going as a joint body. I think Councilwoman Rodham made a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| suggestion in that we're not all going to be able to come to all the meetings. So we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| always going to have all 20 people there. There may be times when we have 15 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| whatever, but I would be in favor if we're going to go in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| direction, everybody be brought to the table on that. Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Yes, can I make a motion that all 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| of us get together once every two weeks for the next two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| months and see what we can do about getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| worked out. This has dragged on long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| and I think this meeting has too. So let's just decide what we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| to do and move forward. So I'd like to make that motion that the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| group, Council and Commission work on this issue together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| and that we have as our goal that we meet once every two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| for two months and see if we can't get something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| at the end of that time. We can't actually vote on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| today, but we can take a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| I'd just like to say this, that I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| and as we've discussed this, that this committee that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| are about to put together would go and review what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| have in common and what we agree on and what we disagree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| and would come back and present that to the City Council and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| County Commission and then they can do whatever they choose with it. The County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Commission has already dealt with this. We voted as a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| to postpone it and to form this joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| committee. So I don't know why we would have a City-County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| 20 members when the County has already acted, the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| is going to act and we were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| looking to have somebody go and facilitate what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| can all agree on. So I'm not afraid of whoever is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| committee, I'm not afraid of what they bring back because I'm still going to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| as a Councilman. I'm going to either agree with it or not agree with it. I'm still going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| to hear from the constituents. So I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| we find an agreeable number of people to go and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| what we've been dealt with here, what we agree on, what we don't agree on, come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| back in the form of a proposal or find areas that we agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| and then submit it to us. So I'm for a smaller committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| However, we can't vote. If we want to have a straw poll, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I'll throw the floor open again and see if anybody has any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| comments. If not, we could have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| straw poll on to see if all 20 of us want to meet or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| we could then again vote to see if we want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| a seven person committee appointed by the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| I mean, I probably know where my Council members stand but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| it's irrelevant to me. I would hope they would go and find where we have common ground and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| come back and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| Can I make a comment before we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| First of all, obviously as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| I think that the whole body has been stated very well by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Mr. Thomas the reasons for how you could do this in a fair way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| in a truly representative way. I don't think you could do it unless the whole body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| is on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| That brings us to the point of, I mean, after our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| straw poll vote, we still need to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| time frame and we still need to deal with chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| And so the chair as a facilitator I think is a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| concept as Ms. Palmer has stated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| I think we also have some volunteer, we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| opportunity to employ somebody if necessary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| somebody outside this community would be a good idea I think because of the volatility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| of the issue. But to the issue now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| I guess straw poll is for this formation of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| and we can do that. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| What if we had a straw poll and you can either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| say 20 person or 10 person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| So it would be five commission, five council with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| a facilitator. So it would be 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Okay. Which end do we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| start on? Okay, Commissioner Burroughs. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Who's going to take, Ms. Wilson would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| Mr. Swanson you keep count here. Okay. Commissioner Burroughs has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| 20. It's either a 20 person or a 10 person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| Would the facilitator be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| one of, would it be an outside person or one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| commissioners or councilman? I would suggest outside person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Outside. Alright, outside. We got a 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| Commissioner Norman. 20. Commissioner Ornby. 10. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| Pass. Commissioner Chavez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| To move it forward I'll say 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| Commissioner Andrews. 20. I'll say 20. 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| 20. 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| 20. 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| 20 it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| Alright, now what's the charge of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| that we would want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| I'm not sure I'm addressing your question exactly, but I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| we would want to have a first session to list all of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| of agreement and disagreement and see then what we're tackling. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| really important to do in terms of an overall charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| I suppose that comes back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| base question. Are we talking simply about coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| up with a desirable plan to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| in both organizations or are we talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| tackling specific problems that we see really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| are urgent and need treatment. Maybe the committee of the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| has to do that, but I think the first order of business is find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| what we're tackling in terms of where there's agreement, where there's disagreement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I guess some general discussion of what we'd like to accomplish. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| that we know sitting here where we are unless we talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Commissioner Briggs. You know who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| I think would be a good person to address that would be Tony Norman because my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| understanding was it doesn't do any good to talk about passing ordinances until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| you have a plan because if the plan doesn't pass then there's nothing with the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| and I think wasn't that the original, what I would say is that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| a plan, get it in place and then the next stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| would be to deal with ordinances. That was my understanding so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| to avoid making this too complicated because it's complicated enough already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| is we need to have a plan and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| go from there. That was the original intention I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| As Mr. Swanson just said, the activity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| this 20 member body is going to create, in my mind, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| create a new plan. We would reconcile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| the sticking points and in dealing with those sticking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| points we would come to agreement on those. We would form a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| We'd send it back to MPC and we'd go from there. That's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| charge in my mind. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Councilman Palmer. The genesis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| our discussion this afternoon goes back to three years ago when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| both groups, Commission and Council, thought that it was very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| that we address this issue. So I think in some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| we've come full circle because we do have a group who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| spent time doing what was asked and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| we're probably at a point where these two groups really do need to get down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| and to borrow Councilman Delavoe's terms, wrestle out these sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| But I think that we need to keep in mind that that original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| set of Commissioners and Councilmembers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| in the course of elections moved on, but the original concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| they had are still with us today. And I'm guessing that looking around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| room that we all feel a huge responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| make the right decisions. With regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| to the facilitator, would it be alright with both bodies if Mr. Bailey and I brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| forth a recommendation or a couple of recommendations on a facilitator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| I have a comment on that. In conferring with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| some folks at Leadership Knoxville, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| can't remember the lady's name that's head of the curriculum committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| she gave me a name. Apparently David Lipscomb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| University is fairly well known for mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| type issues and they could probably provide somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| for us and being from Nashville I think that would be a nice thing to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| somebody from another metro area. If I just may make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| with some conversations I've had with other organizations, that same name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| and same came up. So when I was talking earlier about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| mediator, whatever you want to call it, that was who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| I was exactly talking about. Yes, Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| I'd like to make a suggestion in terms of, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| we all know what we need to do. I would like to suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| at the next meeting we all arrive with a written list of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| our issues are. It's not enough to just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| I'm afraid this plan will hurt development or I'm afraid this plan will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| limit property rights. Be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| What part of it do you think is going to cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| difficulties? I mean be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| specific. If everybody brings a list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| their issues, then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| our starting point. It will be real easy to tell what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| long-hanging fruit and what we really need to dig in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| So, how often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| do we meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Burleson represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| what did you recommend? I recommended once every two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| weeks for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| If I might make a suggestion to the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| and forgive me for being presumptuous if that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| I might suggest to you that if what you intend to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| bring in a professional facilitator whose expertise is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| working through these types of issues, that you schedule a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| meeting at which the facilitator comes in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| proposes to you or has some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| to you about the best method by which including the frequency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| of meeting to accomplish the mission that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Because I think that professional facilitator is going to have some background training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and expertise in how to accomplish this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| task and for us to presume in advance how that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| to occur might be not a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| And so maybe we just schedule the first meeting to bring in the facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| and let the facilitator facilitate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| Okay, do we want to poll the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| council and the commission on a date? We'll work together on a date for the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and work on the facilitator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Would we want to maybe look at the availability of a facilitator before we set a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| We'll work on the facilitator and then the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Let's say we have the facilitator comes in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| sets up the meetings. How are we going to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Is this up to the facilitator to determine how that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| That's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| In my view, the whole process type issue is something that you ought to have at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| input from your facilitator. You all may disagree with your facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| about the degree to which you're going to have public input and those types of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| but I think you at least ought to, before you make decisions on that, have the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| of a professional facilitator's advice as to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| this might best work in the ideal world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Not necessarily being the political world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| I'd just like to say thank you to our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| from the city. When we talk about the word consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| we have all common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| We live in this county. We share a watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| Water doesn't know any political boundaries of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| My colleagues in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| have experienced what it means to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| have, I have to be careful about my terms here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| in terms of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| Development that is not aware or ignorant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| of some basic fundamental principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| about the land. Thanks to Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| for our visual today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Reminds me of my teaching days a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| That's incumbent on us in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| to realize how it will affect you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| with your water problems. Water is the common denominator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| in this. We can talk about hills and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| trees and aesthetics and values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| but when it gets down to the financial aspect of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| it's really water and the effects of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| We all share in that responsibility. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110609hillsideprotection?start=4624)|
