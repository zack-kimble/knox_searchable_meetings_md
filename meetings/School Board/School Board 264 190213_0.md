| 0:00:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=30)|
| 0:00:46| Good afternoon with nine eight board members present we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| And then we'll lead us in the moment of silence and the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=53)|
| 0:01:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=76)|
| 0:01:38| Thank you. Good afternoon, Miss Hill is under the weather today so I'll be filling in for her so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=98)|
| 0:01:47| If you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| I don't think we have any elected officials in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| A couple of announcements, the superintendent's evaluation committee will meet this Friday, February 15 at 11am in the mezzanine conference room of the Andrew Johnson building, and the joint education committee will meet on Wednesday, February 20 at 4pm in the Andrew Johnson building boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=116)|
| 0:02:15| Both of these meeting agendas are published on the KCS website and may be viewed from the Board of Education page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=135)|
| 0:02:25| Several board members will be attending the Tennessee School Boards Association's annual day on the hill events on February 18th and 19th at the double tree by Hilton in downtown Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=145)|
| 0:02:37| This event gives board members a unique opportunity to meet with our state legislators regarding matters relating to education as their session begins next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=157)|
| 0:02:48| In addition, since we have had a lot of sickness and a lot of rumors circulating regarding school cancellation, I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=168)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. First of all, let me just say that the decision, whatever the decision is, makes some people very glad and it makes some people very mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=180)|
| 0:03:10| It's actually a very difficult call to make and we don't take that lightly and certainly wish that all of our employees and students who are ill could get better and be back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=190)|
| 0:03:26| Our team met today, as we do each day, to look at the data and to look at the student absences, look at teacher absences, look at fill rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| Just to give you some idea of what it was today, on our teacher absences, we were running about 91.6% of our teachers were at school today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=215)|
| 0:03:46| In numbers, that's actually 567 teachers absent in comparison to last week where we were about 89% in terms of our teacher attendance, which was about 734 teachers absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=226)|
| 0:04:00| So the fill rate remains to be around 68-69%, so obviously the challenge is trying to get substitutes for the teachers who are out and that remains to be one of our challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=240)|
| 0:04:13| Another thing that complicates the decision, because now there's district competitions that schools are involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Students have worked very hard all year long to participate in these competitions and so that impacts the decision that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Also, there's other kinds of competition other than athletic competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| I know the robotics teams are getting ready for competition there and they weren't able to do that last week due to school closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| There's also a variety of school activities and events, again, that students have worked very hard to prepare for and to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| So all those factors are things we take into consideration in terms of making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| Our student attendance today was roughly 92%, normally it's around 94%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Again, the numbers that we're looking at, and I know it's more than numbers, but just like Mrs. Hill's out tonight, we didn't cancel the board meeting for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=302)|
| 0:05:15| We will evaluate and assess tomorrow, again, look at the numbers and then make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| But just a reminder, if a decision is made to close, we will communicate that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| I know the rumors seem to be going around that we're closing, but unless we make the announcement that we're closed, assume that we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=328)|
| 0:05:37| So we'll do all we can to communicate if we make the decision to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| So I'll be glad to entertain any questions, maybe from board members, if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Otherwise, that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Okay, thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Okay, before we approve the agenda, I wanted to mention, as you'll notice, we are recognizing the bus drivers this evening and that is slated to happen before public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=355)|
| 0:06:08| And if we can be flexible on that, we may need to add public forum before we recognize the bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| It just kind of depends on our time frame and whether they're here or not, if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| All right, and then in addition to that, are there any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=381)|

| 0:14:10| Yeah, I just have a question, maybe it's for you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| Is this, when you say it's a pilot, is this just approving it for one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| We would have to come back to the Board again for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Now, it would span over a period of three years on the pilot, but in order to repeat it, we would bring it back to the Board for Board approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Okay, I'm not sure whose light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Okay, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| You sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Okay, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| What, and I have no reason to doubt what this will be approved, but what would be the recourse if we didn't approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=885)|
| 0:14:58| Would we have to just go seek outside and hire somebody or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| Yes, if we do not have staff to provide the services, we would have to do outside contracts to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| So, you know, if this is not approved, we would continue on with the plan that we have in terms of the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| But, again, if there are services, if we cannot hire folks to provide those services, by law, we'll have to get outside contractors to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=918)|
| 0:15:28| Okay, and that's what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Yes, and again, this is based on the fact that we get folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| We, you know, this is a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| If you can't find somebody, I mean, can you be liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| If we don't provide services, I'll let Mr. Dupler address that, but if we cannot provide the services as prescribed, then there would be a liability for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| Well, I understand that, but if it's that difficult, and when at the workshop we talked about that there was nobody in state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| that we were going to have to go to Missouri or South Carolina or somewhere and recruit people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| that's just, you know, maybe I don't understand it, but that just amazes me that there's nobody that's qualified that we could hire in state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=968)|
| 0:16:22| either at state university or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Yes, there is, and again, it's just the number of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Entering the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| And I have some concern about, you know, once we start down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| I know we've provided incentives for some of the hardest staff positions in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| but, you know, is that the road we're headed down, that every time we can't find somebody, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| we throw out money to them, and, you know, why is it 7,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Why is it not, you know, who's to say 10,000 would not provide more incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I believe that is the path that we're headed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Ms. Erwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I'm concerned about the fiscal impact of this, because what I hear from teachers is not necessarily that they are leaving because of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1029)|
| 0:17:19| but they are leaving more because of working conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| and it just happens that they end up in places where there's higher pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| because most of the counties around us do have higher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| I'd like some more information on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| The last time we heard this, I believe we were led to believe that the 80 to 95 positions were projected based on our planned openings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1055)|
| 0:17:48| and if I understand correctly, those were actually based on national projections that may not actually impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1068)|
| 0:17:59| And so if we could have some clarification on how that number was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| showing the expected staffing needs of 80 to 95 positions, I would like to have some clarification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| So when we're looking at those numbers, the 55, and I'm going to ask Dr. Brooke Denard Rosser to kind of speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| She made the presentation when you talked about the national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| I think the statement that you said about the national was that special ed teachers are leaving nationally at a rate twice that as regular ed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| It's something to paraphrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| But I think that's based on our national trends, and it's not just all inclusive of special ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| but our difficult staff positions, and this also has added several, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1126)|
| 0:18:55| like positions to be considered for our existing $5,000 sign-up bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| which would be speech language therapist, school psychologist, hearing specialist, vision specialist, and audiologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| and I think that would be that cumulative total that you're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| So, Mr. Bolton, if they are leaving at twice the rate, that doesn't mean that we are facing double the number of openings next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| So if I may, the basis of the numbers, how we got to that 80 to 95 teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| was based on one annual attrition over the course of the last three school years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| So on average, at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, we typically see attrition around 25 teachers at each of those specific levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| So that brought us up to 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| The addition to that was based on projected vacancies, based on the retirement incentive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| So it was the combination that got us to that 80 to 90 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| If average attrition for those three levels is 75, I don't understand how the comparison was made that in the past we've had 40 to 50 openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1191)|
| 0:20:09| Those are combinable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| We've begun with the number of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| On average. So I think we're talking about, it's I think a combined number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| The other piece of that I think is, in some instances, when you look at the vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| what you're not able to account for in that is, in those instances where we have had to do outside contracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| those positions no longer show as vacant, but we did have to fill those positions with outside sourcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1238)|
| 0:20:53| I will say this, the intention of this plan is to work inside of the allocated dollars that have already been budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| So that's where you're seeing the 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| So Mr. Bolton, does that mean that what we're trying to do is use those allocated dollars rather than necessarily creating a plan that uses dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1264)|
| 0:21:19| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| Would we necessarily need to do this this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Or would we be able to take care of changing from a bonus plan to a stipend plan without raising it to $7,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1290)|
| 0:21:41| I'll take a shot at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| So I think the big piece of why we decided to up the amount and then spread it out over the course of the three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| is because currently if you look at what our incentive structure is, if you're a SPED teacher coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| you're not going to be able to do that in the first year anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| And that, based on what we're anticipating, is not enough currently to make us competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| So the objective there was not only to try and be more competitive in terms of what we were bringing in for this year specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| given the large need, but it also was to build in a retention component of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| so that we spread it out over the course of three years and didn't absorb that big increase all in the first year of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| And what I'm hearing from teachers is that, regarding being competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| they want to be competitive with other districts. They don't want to be competitive with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| And when we are giving $7,000 bonuses to some teachers and not to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| even if they are in high-need areas, there are some, there are many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| who feel very devalued by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1364)|
| 0:22:53| And I think we would, I think it would behoove us to look at our MOU that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| where we said that if funds are available, those funds will go to an overall teacher pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| We have funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| So it's going to be very disingenuous for us to put these funds into incentives for some teachers and not others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| when we have an MOU that says if we have funds available, we will use them for a pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| So if possible, I would like to find another way to look at this that does not use additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| and can move some of those funds into teacher pay for the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| which would make the district more competitive with those surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| And look, I just wanted to say this, with the $5,600 that are allocated to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| currently we're offering a $5,000 signing bonus to those hardest staff positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| If we were to divide that up between all teachers, you're looking at an average of about $100 more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| something like that, on the annual salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| But the intention of this is to work inside of the allocated dollars to try to find a method that would, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| bring teachers here, and two, retain them for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| Mr. Bolton, if I can ask a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| If I'm correct in remembering, the $560,000 is currently in your budget, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| So what we would be the additional $560,000 for each of the year two and three, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| would you expect that would be above your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Or would it be allocated in your budget already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| It's allocated in our budget, so it's requesting no additional dollars, but working within the means that we've been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Just guaranteeing that the $560,000 would be there this year, the $560,000 would be there the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| and the $560,000 would be there the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| If we were to do a pilot program, we would have to come through with our agreement to those folks to give them the $7,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| as long as they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So there would be some dollars that we would have to look at to guarantee that, but we're saying working inside of our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| allocated dollars, assuming that those dollars would be there in the next two subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you, Dr. Rosser, for your work on this, and Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| But I do tend to agree with Ms. Owen about, I think, where she's going with this, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| but would it be possible that a newly hired special ed teacher with a bonus would actually be making a greater salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| than someone several years into the same position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1564)|
| 0:26:18| That is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Okay, and I could see how that would create some friction, you know, discontent, and that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| So I don't know what to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| I get the idea you've got to have something to attract these people and incentives to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| but I don't know how to balance the problem there that you might create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| I want to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Our thought process with it, too, is that since we are, for some of these more difficult-to-staff positions where there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| accreditation programs that are close to us, we're thinking about the additional cost that would be incurred to move here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| moving expenses and some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| And so that would kind of account for that additional need for money at the onset of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Do we have exactly what those positions would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| I'm happy to try to take a stab at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Special education teachers, school psychologists, speech language therapists, audiologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| I think that's pretty much, I think that's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Oh, hearing specialists, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| A couple of people that are interested in coming back and doing a job share, and certainly we will take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| The reality is that, looking back to what you said, Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| the University of Tennessee has 12 graduates in special education who are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| Some of them are not from our area, so they're not interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| I mean, they already have jobs back home, but we are meeting with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| We are meeting with the graduates from the local colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Carson Newman has a little bit less than 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| And just looking at, I mean, we are very actively recruiting the local colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| And for the people who are in our area, I mean, we'll offer early contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| We will hire some of those people in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| We will hire some people from outside of our local area if we're going to fill all of our future vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| And how, again, I'll remind you that how this all came about was I went to Dr. Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| sorry, to say how can we, you know, can we come with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Can we help? Because, you know, we could interview and offer early contracts on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| And that's when she said, quite frankly, we're just not competitive when other people are standing there with much bigger incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| Special education teachers are a national shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| And we are probably behind the curve a little bit, that it's hit here in this area a little bit slower than maybe in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| But we've struggled. I mean, we currently have openings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Our assessment specialist pieces, we have a number of speech language hearing specialists and psychologists on the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| Those are the places where we will have to outside contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| We have a speech language therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And we utilize the contract that we have to hire somebody from outside to fill a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| That is going to be about 100, I think I ran the numbers at about 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Don't hold me to that figure, but it's like 85 to 105 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| So if you average that out times 200 days, somebody can do some quick math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| It's not going to be sound for us to try to entice people to come when we're being fiscally responsible and making sure that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| making sure that we're serving students appropriately, but also trying to be fiscally responsible, unless we're open to other suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| But this seems like the fiscally more responsible recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you. Okay. I'm not sure who was first. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| And I hear Ms. Owen and Mr. Norman's concerns, but am I right, their base pay is not above what others are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| And after three years, I mean, they might get this bump for a three-year thing, which might help with moving, or just the incentive to get them in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| But once the incentive is over, their base pay is not higher than those that are currently in the job. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| I understand. And when I look at the fact, and that was a question I had before Ms. Drennan brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| is, you know, when we're looking fiscally responsible, do we offer incentives to get the people to work for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| that is going to be a lot less than paying contractors, that in the long run is going to cost us a lot more money, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| And what I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on, because that's what I was questioning, is just the comparison in the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| Because I remember having private contracted psychologists in my school, and how their hourly rate compares to what they would be making as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1887)|
| 0:31:41| staff member in Knox County. Because for the life of me, I'm not sure why anybody would not be in private practice except they wanted to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1901)|
| 0:31:50| students or whatever, and didn't want that responsibility of an overhead of an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| But I would think that the pay rate for, especially like a psychologist or a speech therapist, is astronomical compared to our pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1915)|
| 0:32:07| Is that correct? Can you talk to that a little bit? Because it would help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| Yeah, we have RFPs with a few agencies, and again, we've granted a few. And we have not, we've been very fortunate. I mean, when several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| years ago, we had multiple contracts, and we were paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracted services. We've been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| fortunate, and that we've been able to, you know, operate within the staffing that we have. But our numbers are very low. I mean, they're so low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1946)|
| 0:32:37| at the point right now that one of our special ed supervisors is using part of her time every week to be a speech therapist at one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| schools, because we don't have anybody to cover that caseload. And so she's doing other things that she's not supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| That's why we're doing the contract services at night and being the speech language therapist during the day. But if we were contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| those services, again, we would be looking at anywhere from 85 to, I think it's 105 or 115 dollars an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you. And one other question. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Well, my question was, I think my concern is if we already have the $5,000 signing incentive in place that, in which case, do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=1990)|
| 0:33:20| vacancies? I think that's very telling. How long has the $5,000 signing bonus been in place? Do you know roughly? I mean, has it been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2000)|
| 0:33:32| for the last couple of years or three, four years it's been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, certainly since my time. I would say the last three to five it's been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Okay. Okay. Thank you. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I just wanted to make a comment of how many other bonuses we have for hard-to-staff areas. I'm thinking of, like, statistics and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2027)|
| 0:33:57| areas where we have other bonuses. And I know we have some, I think, master teachers who also have bonuses. Just a rough number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2037)|
| 0:34:07| of, I don't even mean the rough number of people. If we could have a rough number of that total cost of other hard-to-staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| bonuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| I would have to go back and look, because I want to be pretty precise with that. But that's something that we could provide. I think when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| you're looking at bonuses, right now we just have, as I recall, only the $5,000 bonus that we offer. There may be some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2063)|
| 0:34:33| positions that are given an additional stopping for the position that they hold. But I'm not for sure about how many master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| teachers we have or anything like that that would satisfy that. But I certainly can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| And what possible, maybe this is a question for Mr. Dupler. I'm thinking about what recourse our staff might have if we fail to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2086)|
| 0:35:02| our MOU that says that we would not be able to meet our MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| We would not give 4% increase to teachers if funds are available, or to the extent that funds are available. I'd have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| look at that exact language. But it seems to me that if we have funds available for additional stipends and additional bonuses, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2116)|
| 0:35:27| we have some funds available that could be used there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| So what potential legal ramifications are there of us not meeting our MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you, Madam Chair and Ms. Owen. I'd have to go back and look at the MOU, but I believe you're talking about the collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| conferencing MOU. But I would have to review that exact language. But I believe it talks about certain parameters and whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2150)|
| 0:36:02| necessary or not. And I think that's the root of your question. So I mean, I would actually have to be looking at it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| To give an opinion. But I can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| Any other discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Okay. So there is a motion on the floor to approve. Would you restate the motion, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2181)|
| 0:36:33| Actually, it's very simple. Approve special education recruitment incentive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| The motion was made by Mr. Norman and seconded by Ms. Vabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| Okay. All right. All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| All those opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Okay. With two board members abstaining or not voting no, the vote is 6-2. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| Okay. Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I would like to make a motion to have the chair create a committee of board members with Ms. Horn as the committee chair to complete the work of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2226)|
| 0:37:29| board's strategic plan. Okay. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| Okay. Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Yes. Board member Olin, can you elaborate a little bit more on what you would like to come out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Yes. This version of the strategic plan came to us yesterday. So basically we're back in the same situation we were last week with a plan that came to us the day before so that we have not had time to adequately look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| And the public has not had time to adequately look at it so that we can be transparent. And I would hope that as this is the board's strategic plan that the board could take that on and make sure that it gets completed and brought to us in a timely fashion so that we can move on with it, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2279)|
| 0:38:29| So I'm asking that our chair create a committee of board members with Ms. Horn as the committee chair to complete the work of the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2309)|
| 0:38:46| Ms. Baum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| And could I make a suggested timetable that by the next, I mean, we're in February, where are we? By the next board meeting, hoping to have a meeting with Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Do we have some product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| I'm not sure a committee could be created and meet within that timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| And you might be right, maybe, I don't know how quickly we can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| I would be glad to add by the beginning of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| I think that would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Any specific changes you would like to advocate for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| I think we've talked about several that haven't necessarily shown up, especially under personalized learning and strategic initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2375)|
| 0:39:48| It seems that under personalized learning, we're actually talking about supporting data instead of supporting students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| And I thought we talked about that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| I think it would be good to have board members really look carefully at the mission statement, even though it's not listed there as a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2402)|
| 0:40:14| So maybe I'm not even looking at the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| I'm looking at so many different things that have changed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| To look at the mission statement and maybe look at some past mission statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| To see how that could better work and be sure that we have gone through and made sure all things make grammatical sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2432)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you. Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| This is our, so when I was elected to the board, there was a strategic plan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| And it was very detailed and very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| And then it came back that we didn't like it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| And then the staff and Superintendent Thomas presented this, and then we've critiqued it and said that we don't like this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And so I'm just really, maybe I don't know what a strategic plan is supposed to look like or be like, because I don't know what we're looking for or what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| And I'm sure that it might be the same case for the staff as well, because we've been, all of us have been giving a lot of different messages, and they have put in a lot of work to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2486)|
| 0:41:37| And so if we take this motion that you presented, board member Owen, we have to be clear and concise on what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2497)|
| 0:41:47| So that we're not taking energy away from what they're doing, what they're supposed to be doing to run our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| And I, yeah, and I would like a timeline, because I feel like we've been playing with the strategic plan for months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2514)|
| 0:42:05| I'm almost a year in, and we've been talking strategic plan, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Ms. Baum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| I just want to speak to, that I kind of agree with Ms. Owens and Ms. Satterfield, in that overall, I like the structure we have been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| I just think there is a little crafting that needs to be done, that I think it's hard for us to go ahead and say, yes, this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| And I do think maybe more of a committee-type meeting, discussing it, I mean, as an example, I'll give one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| Under increasing student achievement, we have a strategic objective, increase student performance on state and district assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| I keep getting bogged down that we always talk about we want kids to do better on tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| We do, but the real reason we want them to do better on tests is because we want them to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| I think that is actually like more a bullet point under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| So I think there's just little things like that. I really, I like this format, and I mean, I'm really not being critical of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| I think there just needs to be fine-tuning that I think is almost in the board structure hard to discuss very productively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| I would agree with that, Ms. Babb. I think we're probably 90% there, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| I agree with all, and that's where I kind of agree with Ebony. I'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| I think it just more needs crafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| I don't think any of us are disagreeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| What we really need to do is we have, I agree very much that it's difficult in this structure to go through and take care of all those things that need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2619)|
| 0:43:54| And as we are tasked with having a strategic plan, at some point we have to take it and own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| And I think the only way we can take it and own it is to take it and own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| So that's what I'm suggesting that we do, is that we have a committee that takes care of ownership of the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2648)|
| 0:44:18| so that we don't keep going back and forth and back and forth and wasting staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Madam Chair. I support both of you, and I do think that it is important to take ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| And I don't think the format of the way we have to meet as a board lends itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| And then we give them a suggestion, and it just, instead of being able to sit down and actually do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| But I do like your idea of a time frame, and I would support if at least the April deadline meeting, if that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2685)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you, Ms. Mounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| I'm not unhappy with what's here, but it's just this format makes it very difficult, as has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| So I think that to just take a look at it in a smaller committee would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| And I would say we probably wouldn't need until April, because there probably just wouldn't be enough time between now and March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| So, could you, is there any other discussion, Ms. Mounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| Ms. Coatney, can you restate the motion? Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Okay, I'm going to add the timeline to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| I would like to ask the board members, with Ms. Horne as the committee chair, to complete the work of the board's strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and present it to the full board by the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| By the first, the early April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| Okay, Ms. Babs, do we have discussion on the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Okay, all those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2783)|
| 0:46:33| Mr. Oaks, would we like to go ahead or would we like to move public forum up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| I think at this point we'd like to go ahead and do public forum and then recognize our drivers subsequent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, all right, that sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| We have Nicole Bigman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| If I may, I worked with Attorney Bigman and her colleague, Attorney Belk, on a matter, and she's going to be speaking about not the exact matter that we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| And I will say that, according to my information, I feel like the district and the school involved has appropriately responded to this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2834)|
| 0:47:26| But I believe Ms. Bigman is going to talk about a larger issue, and that's why she wanted to come before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| She is a resident of the Atlanta area, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| But she represents a Knox County family, so I know this board's policy, and I would ask this board to go ahead and approve her to speak under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2858)|
| 0:47:52| But I think the board does need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| Could you state your name and county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Any motion to approve Ms. Bigman to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| A motion to allow her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| Okay, any discussion? Okay, all those in favor? Any opposed? Okay, go ahead, Ms. Bigman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| First off, thank you for allowing me to speak. I know that I needed approval. Mr. Dupler, I sincerely appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| So I'm here today on behalf of the Moore family. They've asked me to speak on their behalf today regarding an incident that occurred with their daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| They're still too grief-stricken to speak on their own, and that's why I'm here today to kind of share their story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| and hopefully create what is a really sad incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| and hopefully maybe we can all learn from it and make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| On January 14th, Cameron Moore, a student at Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| was attacked violently and premeditated with a metal water bottle at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| And school is a place that all students and all kids should feel safe, and I think we can all agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| And really what the Moore family is asking in a nutshell, and I've provided you all with some material on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| There's a one-page overview and then some photos of the before and after and some examples of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| that have found everyday objects to be violent weapons. But in a nutshell, what we're asking is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| the school board consider that a metal water bottle be considered a weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| and be banned from school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Basically the thought is behind that is there's no great utility of this metal water bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| It can easily be substituted out by a plastic water bottle or plenty of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| And now that one student has seen and other students have seen the severe damage that can be caused by these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| it's safer for all students to not have them in the buildings at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| As you can see in the photos I've provided, it was a pretty brutal attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| She will have a likely permanent scar on her face, and as a young girl that is a really traumatic thing for her to have to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| And ultimately the family just wants to ensure that this doesn't happen not only to their daughter again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| but to any other student in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| And so that's why we are proposing that these metal water bottles be banned from schools entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| And there are other local cases that have found other objects to be deadly weapons in a criminal context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| And the reason I've provided that is to show you all that while a sock and a pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| and there's a laundry list of examples in these cases that I'm not going to bother reading out to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| we're trying to be reasonable here and the Moore family is trying to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| And this isn't like we're asking to ban a pen or a pencil that clearly has social utility in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| You know, kids need pens and pencils in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| There's no great and overriding reason why a student needs to have a metal water bottle that's heavy and can easily be used as a weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| And there's concern that now that this has happened once that it's going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| And this appears to be a planned attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| And it just makes sense to try to protect the youth and the kids in schools by banning this object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| And I don't want to waste any more of y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| So that is the gist of it. There is a one page overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I'll save a little bit of time if you have any questions about why we're asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| But really, in a nutshell, this is just the Moore family just trying to protect not only their daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| but, you know, try to use a really awful situation so that we can all learn from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| So my proposal is I can reserve that time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| We don't do question and answer during public forum, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| I just figured I'd ask. I won't waste that last minute and a half then, but that's kind of what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| So if y'all have any questions, I think the material I've provided should kind of give a good overview and just take a look at those photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Because I think that really gives you a better story than anything I can say ever really will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3120)|
| 0:52:12| Ms. Langston, if you'll give us your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Deborah Langston, Knox County, and I am an employee of the county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| It's good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| I've talked with, of course, our best and only Bob Thomas about cursive writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| I am concerned, and I have been told by them both that it is in our curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| Know that it was not there for a while, and if it was there, then I've talked with several teachers that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| I just don't have the time. We've got to have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3172)|
| 0:53:01| My signature, their signature, your signature is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| I went to take the drug test for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| I said, can I write in manuscript?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| I said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| So to be, so cursive to be taught is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| For signature itself, my manuscript signature, the way I write my name is not my signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| We can look at bank accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| We can look at in and out of the country, things we can take from your city to another country that cyber criminal can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| But I want to also say very quickly, cursive writing is very important for a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3223)|
| 0:53:54| I can't say, I guess, enough that we need to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| I know it's taught in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| I think when I went to school, I'm 51, so I went to Beaumont, and I think the teachers there taught it second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Learning cursive writing second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| But I've met two children in Austin East, one mother could write in cursive, the child could write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| The other child could not, his mother could not write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| But they're in the same grade, the same grade level, same curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Kind of startled me, kind of threw me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| About cursive writing, calling back, talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| I just want to make sure, and I guess I can't express enough, we need to have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| My second thing, and that's why I'm going to hurry about that, I can talk all day about that, because I can say that it really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| one more thing on the cursive writing, I believe it's an enslavement of all nationalities, not just one where it used to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| But our children need to have cursive writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| Retirees that come back to the county, I know there's subs, I know there's full permanent employees that come back, I know they're all part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3308)|
| 0:55:21| I know that my concern is that they need to be able to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| People capable and ready to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| As a regular employee, no matter what department it is, if they're not ready to do that job, it's hard on a regular permanent employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| And that includes a certified teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| If a sub come in and I've been told, I can't even do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Why? You're subbing a 5th, 6th, 7th grade class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| It's a piece of paper, y'all can give it to that child, but what happens when that child asks me, how do I do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| We've got to make sure that our subs and our retirees, most of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| if it comes back as a teacher, a paraprofessional, a custodial or custodian doing custodial work, make sure they can do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| I understand that 10 foot, 8 foot is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| I understand calculus that I might can do that someone else can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| But whatever that teacher has on that day, that person, that sub, no matter where it is, a permanent or part-time must be able to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3391)|
| 0:56:40| Or it actually makes it hard on that permanent employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| I want to retire here at Knox County Schools, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| But if I decide to come back in a department less than mine or more than mine, I want to be able and capable to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| So that's what I'm asking, that when you look at and you vote on a person coming back from retirement, that they are capable and willing and ready to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| Angel Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Hi, Ms. Bowman. Just state your name and your county, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Angel Bowman, Knox County. Good evening. My name is Angel Bowman and I'm here tonight to ask that you consider adding Lonsdale Elementary School to the capital plan to receive a much needed education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3448)|
| 0:57:38| I represent a group of parents in the Lonsdale community who share my concerns and desire for a new school and I am here to share with you some of those thoughts tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| I am a homeowner in Lonsdale at 1719 Connecticut Avenue. I go to church at Open Door Church in Lonsdale. I teach Vacation Bible School in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3467)|
| 0:57:57| I am involved in the Emerald Youth in Lonsdale. So in pretty much every way, I am spiritually, physically and financially invested in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| And I am here tonight because I am not just invested in Lonsdale. I am just as invested in Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3483)|
| 0:58:14| I first moved to Lonsdale in 2002. My son was six years old at the time and I watched him grow up at Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| He was a short, shy little kid when we first moved here, but at Lonsdale my son grew into an avid reader, a spokesperson for the school and Knoxville's promise and a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| And by the time my son had graduated fifth grade, he was the manager at the school's bare butt store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3507)|
| 0:58:38| Today, I have two more children at Lonsdale Elementary, a seven year old and an eight year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| And in one more year, I'll enroll my daughter in preschool at Sammy Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| After that, she will follow in her brother's footsteps as she moves to Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| I am here as a concerned parent to tell you that Lonsdale Elementary of today is not what it was in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| And it certainly is not the school it was when it received its first and only addition in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| And it definitely isn't the school it was when it was first built in 1936.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| That's right. Our students are in a school built in 1936 and it shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| Last semester I got a call from the school saying that I needed to pick my kids up from Sammy Hill, because they had been evacuated from Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| because carbon monoxide gas had leaked into the school. And as a parent, I was terrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| I took my kids to the doctor and I was told to watch for possible flu-like symptoms over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And I'll tell you, everything, everything seemed like flu-like symptoms for the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| I can personally say that I did not send my kids back to school the day after the carbon monoxide leaked, because I was still worried about their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| I only let my boys return to school after their teachers had assured me it was safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| And I just want to say that I am so grateful to the awesome staff at Lonsdale for keeping my kids safe through the entire evacuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3595)|
| 1:00:03| Our teachers walked with our kids in the 30-degree weather, the pouring down rain, to get their students, our students, from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| From the unsafe environment to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And my trust in the school's amazing staff is why my kids are back at Lonsdale today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| But the fact is, we shouldn't have carbon monoxide leaks in schools. We shouldn't have flooding in the basements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| We shouldn't have parents missing out on school events, because Lonsdale isn't handicap accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We should have a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| We serve lunch in the basement, because the school doesn't even have enough space for a teacher's lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| And I saw firsthand how wet and damp and moldy the basement was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| I could see the mildew on the walls, and I could feel how wet the books on the shelves were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| And these are the books that my kids, our kids, read in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| I've been told, I'm sorry, I've been to the adult bathrooms at Lonsdale, and they are not pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| There are two bathroom stalls for adults in the entire school, and they are tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| But they are what our teachers use every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| I didn't even fit comfortably in the bathroom, and that's what we expect our teachers to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Not only that, the bathrooms aren't even handicap accessible. The school isn't handicap accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| When I was younger, I was in a bad car accident that left me physically disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| I have a lot of pain that I cope with as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| And when I think about the fact that our parents in wheelchairs can't attend school meetings and events because they can't even go into the gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| or because they can't even go to the bathroom in their child's school, I just think that could be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| And I can't imagine not being active in my kids' lives, in their education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| because the school wasn't built to accommodate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| It's not just about the wet basement or the lack of handicap accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| It's the fact that our school is no longer the learning environment that our kids deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| I was at Lonsdale last week, and I found out that an entire classroom had lost heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| There was an entire classroom of kids that had been sent to other classes because their room was too cold to learn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Our kids should not have to have their learning interrupted because their school is too old to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| I have seen firsthand how smart and capable our kids are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| And we have some of the best teachers in all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Just imagine what our kids would have done if they had the school they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Okay, we have Zimbabwe Metavo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3759)|

| 1:03:44| As to the veterans at Knox County School Board, you know why I visit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| The new members, this may be your introduction to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| Knox County was founded in 1792, 16 years after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3842)|
| 1:04:10| African slaves had been in the region for 300 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| Knox County maintained and nourished that institution until the imposition of the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution in 1865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| Seventy-three years after the founding of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3865)|
| 1:04:45| The 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson U.S. Supreme Court decision legalized the segregation of African slaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3885)|
| 1:04:55| Knox County incorporated Jim Crow and adhered to it until the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3895)|
| 1:05:16| From 1954 to 2018, Knox County Board of Education has recognized African slaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| It has not provided equal education to the African American citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3924)|
| 1:05:33| Debating whether the county is unwilling or unable is superfluous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| The fact is, 123 years after Plessy v. Ferguson, and 65 years after Brown v. Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3941)|

| 1:06:22| responsibility, and power commensurate with all school districts in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=3982)|

| 1:07:11| Tonight we're here to recognize a special group of people, our Knox County school bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| Currently, Knox County Schools contracts with independent service providers who operate more than 335 buses on instructional days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| and travel in excess of 3 million miles each year, or 20,000 miles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4043)|
| 1:07:34| Drivers are the first face that students see each day as they begin their school day, and the last before arriving home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| While safety is our number one priority, the role drivers play in setting the tone each day can also be invaluable to students overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4063)|
| 1:07:52| positive attitude toward learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190213?start=4072)|
