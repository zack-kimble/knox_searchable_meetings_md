| 4:50:09| We call for, number one, international pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17409)|
| 4:50:13| diplomatic efforts to press the Bangladeshi government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17413)|
| 4:50:15| to cease its violent suppression of dissent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17415)|
| 4:50:18| and to step down from power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17418)|

| 4:50:39| Also, advocate to take every necessary measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17439)|
| 4:50:43| to ban student politics in educational institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17443)|

| 4:50:53| is a shared global responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17453)|
| 4:50:55| By standing with the oppressed people of Bangladesh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17455)|
| 4:50:57| we reaffirm our commitment to these universal values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17457)|
| 4:51:01| As Martin Luther King Jr. famously said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17461)|
| 4:51:03| as I mentioned earlier at the opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17463)|
| 4:51:05| injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17465)|
| 4:51:08| We thank you again for your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17468)|
| 4:51:09| and we thank you also in anticipation of your willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17469)|
| 4:51:13| to act on behalf of those who cannot raise their voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17473)|
| 4:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17476)|
| 4:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17477)|
| 4:51:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17478)|
| 4:51:20| Kim Wilson-Owen is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17480)|
| 4:51:25| Ms. Owen, you have up to five minutes to address council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17485)|
| 4:51:27| if you will state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17487)|
| 4:51:35| I am Kim Wilson-Owen and I am in District 6, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17495)|
| 4:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17500)|
| 4:51:44| I had to attempt to learn about this very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17504)|
| 4:51:49| Thank goodness I learned so much more about it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17509)|
| 4:51:52| during these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17512)|
| 4:51:53| This was quite a night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17513)|
| 4:51:57| So based on those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17517)|
| 4:51:58| I may jump around a bit in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17518)|
| 4:52:01| I'm here in support of Councilor Parker's proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17521)|
| 4:52:04| especially district only city council elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17524)|
| 4:52:07| which I recognize Councilor Parker is willing to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17527)|
| 4:52:11| with the council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17531)|
| 4:52:13| When I moved home to Knoxville in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17533)|
| 4:52:16| and walked to support my District 6 candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17536)|
| 4:52:18| in my next election, I was stumped and dismayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17538)|
| 4:52:22| to find that regardless of the feelings and votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17542)|
| 4:52:25| of the people in District 6, the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17545)|
| 4:52:28| very few of whom have put the time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17548)|
| 4:52:30| in the District 6 community had the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17550)|
| 4:52:35| I can't think of a worse idea than making taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17555)|
| 4:52:39| and voters and citizens of Knoxville districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17559)|
| 4:52:43| subject to the tyranny of the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17563)|
| 4:52:46| Does West Knoxville want East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17566)|
| 4:52:49| or Lonsdale or Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17569)|
| 4:52:51| choosing who represents them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17571)|
| 4:52:53| So why would this council entertain the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17573)|
| 4:52:56| that voters living in one district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17576)|
| 4:52:58| could overrule the choice of representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17578)|
| 4:53:01| in another district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17581)|
| 4:53:02| And to underline my remark about what West Knoxville wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17582)|
| 4:53:08| and doesn't want, they're not here listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17588)|
| 4:53:10| to this public forum right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17590)|
| 4:53:12| to hear their other fellow citizens' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17592)|
| 4:53:16| They're about their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17596)|
| 4:53:17| It's natural that each of us should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17597)|
| 4:53:19| about the concerns in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17599)|
| 4:53:22| Um, so, um, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17602)|
| 4:53:30| We heard the idea that city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17610)|
| 4:53:33| with at-large elections for all city council positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17613)|
| 4:53:38| creates accountability for the citizens in the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17618)|
| 4:53:44| You are already accountable to citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17624)|
| 4:53:48| With district-only elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17628)|
| 4:53:50| the council is more accountable to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17630)|
| 4:53:53| thanks to the increased opportunity for dissent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17633)|
| 4:53:57| and it is your job to have fully informed discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17637)|
| 4:54:01| and work out differences to find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17641)|
| 4:54:04| You are already accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17644)|
| 4:54:06| District-only elections would increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17646)|
| 4:54:10| I also want to point out that letting the city vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17650)|
| 4:54:14| on district six has not moved any needle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17654)|
| 4:54:17| of positive outcome for district six residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17657)|
| 4:54:21| that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17661)|
| 4:54:23| I think I have on good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17663)|
| 4:54:27| since I've been away for some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17667)|
| 4:54:30| and certainly what I've come back to tells me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17670)|
| 4:54:34| city-wide voting on district six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17674)|
| 4:54:35| is not helpful for district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17675)|
| 4:54:39| I wonder, too, as I learned tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17679)|
| 4:54:42| I wonder, too, if we consider that our current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17682)|
| 4:54:45| is working when we have only just five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17685)|
| 4:54:50| elected our first black at-large candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17690)|
| 4:54:54| Is that what we consider working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17694)|
| 4:54:58| Have our minds really changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17698)|
| 4:55:01| Mr. Smith mentioned the guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17701)|
| 4:55:04| the guardrails that come from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17704)|
| 4:55:07| this majority white city vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17707)|
| 4:55:10| on all districts' representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17710)|
| 4:55:14| Those guardrails are the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17714)|
| 4:55:16| with the highest turnout, affluent white voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17716)|
| 4:55:22| I would like to challenge our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17722)|
| 4:55:27| as I have been attempting to do myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17727)|
| 4:55:30| to think through what the meaning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17730)|
| 4:55:33| of institutional racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17733)|
| 4:55:35| It means that in spite of the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17735)|
| 4:55:38| heartfelt intentions of those who participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17738)|
| 4:55:43| the outcomes are inevitably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17743)|
| 4:55:45| is racist, sexist, harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17745)|
| 4:55:49| They are institutionalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17749)|
| 4:55:52| Genderism and sexism and racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17752)|
| 4:55:55| cause bad outcomes, regardless of the good intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17755)|
| 4:56:01| of the people who participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17761)|
| 4:56:04| I apologize, I was chuckling to myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17764)|
| 4:56:07| as we were calling this a diverse city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17767)|
| 4:56:13| So, my time is almost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17773)|
| 4:56:16| I thank you all for the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17776)|
| 4:56:18| I encourage free and fair elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17778)|
| 4:56:23| that stay in the districts affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17783)|
| 4:56:25| and I ask that you all consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17785)|
| 4:56:28| the idea of institutionalized racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17788)|
| 4:56:31| and the outcomes for District 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17791)|
| 4:56:33| and for all minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17793)|
| 4:56:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240723?start=17794)|
