| 0:07:19| Could we get something in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| We don't have to get it, you know, like tomorrow or by this week, but just something so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| we could look at it and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| I mean, it's impressive what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| And I happened to see the news last night and noticed that they had, what was it, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| Three students, yes, graduating with their associate's degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| And that was very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| But I'd just like to get something just in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| It doesn't have to be elaborate or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=477)|

| 0:09:16| I'll give an overview and then Ms. Drennan is here if there's particulars to the questions around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| This is a Sanford Harmony is a social-emotional teaching program that works with the change to the standards for the elementary counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=564)|
| 0:09:36| Part of what they're required to do around their social-emotional lessons, standards changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| I think I'm right on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| And so our counselors have been working with Ms. Heather Willis, our supervisor in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| to develop a social-emotional curriculum that matches those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| So our counselors actually are spending time in classrooms teaching through those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| And then this is a so we have one that we've developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| But this is also a free one that's available to us for our counselors to be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| They provide kits for us to be able to use for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| And it's just an additional one that does align and has been crosswalked to the new standards for counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| So it's really just an additional resource that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I saw that it had no cost, but I'm just curious about why is there no cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=621)|
| 0:10:32| I'll let Ms. Drennan come speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| It was, oh, sorry, Madam Chair, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| It was researched and developed at Arizona State University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| And it was all funded by a philanthropist and donor, T. Denny Stanford, with support from the National University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| that just really wanted to make sure that those resources are available for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| It's not going to be something because we've developed some, our school counselors have developed some lesson plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| that implement the different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| This will just be supplemental material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| There's some really the counselor leadership team has looked at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| and they're very interested in utilizing that either independently or alongside of the lesson plans that they've developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| So is this directed at certain elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Well, it would be available for all the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| School counseling with the new social-emotional learning standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| that's required for us to weave that into our curriculum across this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Sometime in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Seeing no other questions, I'm looking at number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Moving along to number nine, board policies, letter A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=736)|
| 0:12:25| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I guess I should speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I think I had some significant revisions to the policy to begin with, or the last version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=749)|
| 0:12:41| And so for the people that weren't at the policy review meeting, they didn't hear my rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| So just briefly, what I've thought is that recently we've sort of lost control of some of the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=769)|
| 0:12:58| And the public forum's become, I think to many of us, it's become almost what we would call a YouTube theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=778)|
| 0:13:11| And we know people are getting up there and being videoed and sent out to YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I mean, that's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| But I can see that the intent is a little bit beyond what public forum's probably designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=800)|
| 0:13:30| And there's plenty of ways to get in touch with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| So that combined with the lack of proper demeanor, showing the audience and us the proper amount of respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=812)|
| 0:13:44| I thought that some of the revisions that I offered would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And the main one being probably besides the time change, the slight time change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| was that I thought that the requirement for them to sign up 24 hours in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=833)|
| 0:14:03| and that would give and then sign the document, sign the policy saying, yes, I've read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=843)|
| 0:14:12| I agree to these behavioral standards, so to speak, that we have set forth for the public to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=852)|
| 0:14:20| And I agree to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| And so it gives us, I think it gives the speakers an opportunity to reflect both on what they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=862)|
| 0:14:31| and how they're saying it and what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| And that's kind of a good teaching moment, I think, for some people, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| But that's the purpose, to give us more control but not to suppress anybody's ability to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| So that was kind of the rationale for the people that haven't been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| My only concern is, I guess, in policy review, I thought the online form was in addition to what was also listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=900)|
| 0:15:11| I didn't know that the form was going to replace that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| And I thought they would still be able to sign that with the vice chair the day of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| And I hate to restrict or make it harder for people to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Ms. Fuller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| That's one of the things that I also had noticed, Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| that I think that we definitely need to have the ability for people to come and sign up right before our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| And there are times that we've had additional information that has been added to our agenda that the public has made aware of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| And so there could be an occasion that something's been added that they wouldn't have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Typically, that wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| But it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| So I think we need to have that ability for them to be able to sign up at the beginning of our meetings also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| I just have a question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Thinking about freedom of speech, can we limit how things are said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=974)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you, Ms. Allen, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| The board does not have to have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Public forum is not called for in the state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| So public forum is a creation of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| As far as wanting to have proper decorum and proper, you know, discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1010)|
| 0:17:02| I mean, the law department's stance would be, I mean, you know, that falls in line with what is expected in the board's schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1022)|
| 0:17:12| So that's not a problem at all as long as you, if the board is going to have public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1032)|
| 0:17:21| which the board has had public forum obviously for quite some time, that you're not limiting opposing points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| I mean, that would be a restriction on free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| But certainly free speech has its limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| And speech that incites or vulgarities, things of that nature, are not rights under the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1056)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Ms. Sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I had a question about the format of the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| It says that the forum may be obtained online and you can complete it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| So is it something that, like, it has to be printed and filled out and then, like, sent online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| Or is there, like, an option like a Google form where they can complete it online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Because I just have a concern about students being, especially ones who don't have a lot of access to technology unless they're at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| or if their school has, like, a limit on what kind of printing they can do, just their ability to fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| And if they're restricted to how they can fill it out, they might just decide not to speak at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| Do you have some comments about that, Dr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| The form actually can be filled out online via computer and filled out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| or you can do it via a hard copy and handwrite that information in, either fax it in or mail it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| But, yes, it can be filled out via computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| I see Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| I would like to make a comment in regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| I, too, share your concern, Ms. Christie and Ms. Horne, about taking the ability away to sign up the day of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1163)|
| 0:19:35| or right before a meeting, especially given the fact that sometimes information is rather late in being attached to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1175)|
| 0:19:46| just because it's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| It's certainly no one's fault intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So I know that this was a revision that was talked about in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| and I guess I am asking if this is something, in addition to the three of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| that the board would be willing to take another look at that particular part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| Also, we need to keep in mind that this is first reading, so we will be coming back next month on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| To a couple of those statements, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| One, I think that it's almost never would a speaker come and be here or plan to speak and be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1224)|
| 0:20:37| I don't think I've ever heard of it being affected by some late information coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| It's always because they know what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| It's an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| It's been well published and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| But I don't think that's a valid argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| And then to the point of people walking up, that's the whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| I have some concern with somebody who comes in here the day of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| and is maybe too emotionally involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| And I think the 24-hour period would give them time to cool down maybe if it's a hot topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| and basically reflect on the content of what they want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| with the backdrop of how we would like for them to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| And so I think it's just good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I think it would help our meetings go much smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| And so I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| I just wanted to make a point and then I guess ask the law director something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1311)|
| 0:22:00| And if, well, I guess I'll go ahead and ask you, ask the law director this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1320)|
| 0:22:14| If, well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| We have had people who have said they wanted to speak on one subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| and then when they got their time they drifted off either immediately or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| before they sat down they got into something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| That's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I guess my question to the law director would be in order to, if the situation were to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| where something came up late that they really did need to, felt they needed to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| as long as they stayed on that topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| would it be appropriate for the board at that point before they were allowed to speak to, you know, take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| Three-fourths of the board gives them the right to speak or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Madam Chair, so the answer to your question, Mr. McMillan, is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| I mean, the board can certainly always take a vote and allow someone to speak on a particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| That would be a majority vote because majority always rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| There wouldn't be a two-thirds or a three-quarter vote needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| And I think your other question was on a topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| So the current policy already limits speakers to agenda items at work sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| but then on voting sessions it's of topics of whatever interest the speaker has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| In reference to the work sessions, if they did drift off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| would it be appropriate for a board member to challenge that and the board to take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| In terms of cutting the speaker off at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Yes, yes, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, that would first come from the vice chair or the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| but if an individual board member had a concern about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| I mean, that individual member could voice that concern at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| There's not that much passion regarding this policy from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| but I want to kind of just lift up this perspective that there are times where there aren't any attached files| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| to our agenda and we have to wait on those, so I do agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| But possibly if we enforce this policy to where you can't sign up on the day of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| then it could present a level of efficiency that's needed from our constituents to make sure that they're signed up the day before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1511)|
| 0:25:21| and on our end as well to make sure that our files are where they need to be given the opportunities that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| And so I think this might be an opportunity for the board to set that precedent top down to say that we are a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| that is working on efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Ms. Alwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I would just add that every call that comes in to sign up to speak has to be handled by Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| And so whether there may be five or whether there may be 50 or 87,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| she has to speak with each of those people and take all of their information, determine the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| put them in the right place on the agenda, and then give them all of the rules that they need to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| And that is a massive undertaking sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| I think we urgently need a way for people to sign up in addition to that phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And there have been some folks, some contacts I've heard, who thought we were taking out the ability to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| and I want to make sure it's understood that that is still there for folks who cannot sign up online or prefer not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| But for people who can sign up online, it would just make it so much easier for everyone involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1601)|
| 0:26:50| if they can have everything they need right in front of them and see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| and know what they are expected to be speaking on, whether it is to be on the agenda or not on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| in which meeting it is, the efficiency of that, I think we urgently need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| That should not be considered a limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| So I think that addition is definitely what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| The limitations, not as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I definitely concur with Ms. Satterfield and Ms. Irwin because I think what we're striving for is efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| and taking part of the workload off of our board secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| so she is available to get all those documents together and to have all those things, supporting information and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| So I think it is a change, and change is hard, but I do think that that is the way the world is moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1663)|
| 0:27:52| and some boards just do it strictly online, and we've still got options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| So I like their idea of efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| I'm thinking we probably haven't heard the last of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Any other questions or comments at this point on that policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Looking at board policy still, Item B, C, D, E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1698)|
| 0:28:34| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I've just got a question, and this is primarily just procedural, I guess, for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| The use of cell phones in the schools or cell phone use by kids in the schools is a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| For me, I'm getting more and more calls about these devices being in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| and the problems that they cause, social media, Snapchat, all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| Anyway, I'm going to challenge the policy in terms of offering a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1749)|
| 0:29:20| to disallow the use of cell phones in schools, and so in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| And so if I want to do that, do I want to do that here, or do I want to create an agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1769)|
| 0:29:41| I mean, if the board was in agreement to that, then this policy would be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1781)|
| 0:29:52| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Thank you, Mr. Norman, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| The law director's recommendation would be to change this policy, if that's what your motion would be, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1800)|
| 0:30:10| So, you know, and that would do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| That would further flesh out and give detail as to your proposal, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| is it similar to an elementary, middle school, and making that applicable to all schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| or is it just, you know, don't use phones at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| So you'd have a little bit more detail to your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Plus, I mean, your motion is going to affect this policy no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| So my recommendation would be to remove the current, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| your motion would be to remove the current recommended changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| and to either send this back to a policy review meeting or to come up with a new version and put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1857)|
| 0:31:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| I am correct, though, that tonight is not the night to propose any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| This is not a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Looking at item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| Moving on to number 10, grants, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1892)|
| 0:31:57| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I wanted to look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| I think when I looked at this before, we didn't have proof that there was that money in the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I know there's a summary of the estimate, but is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| do we have adequate documentation that they do have this money in an account to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Let me defer, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I know Mr. Oaks has worked with Doug on this, so money is in the bank, the foundation, WIST.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=1951)|

| 0:33:48| Madam Chair, we have no one signed up tonight for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2028)|

| 0:34:18| So we're looking at a 9-1 season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2058)|

| 0:34:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Ms. Owen, if I could circle back to you, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2074)|

| 0:34:53| I will circle back to Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Yes, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| We enjoyed having Mayor Jacobs at Central High School this morning and board members who were there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| And I think we heard a very positive message, and we're just glad to have him in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| So that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Now we'll go to the bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Today has been a very active day looking at legislation that will impact our schools and our budget over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| And exactly how it will impact is still unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| So I'm going to give you three brief reports on what has happened today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| The Senate and House passed two different versions of the ESA voucher bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| And so to create one law, they had to either agree to one of those versions or appoint a conference committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| And so neither would accept the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| And so they appointed a conference committee, and 10 members were appointed to serve on the conference committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| five from the House and five from the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Each body was represented by four Republicans and one Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| The committee met early this morning and spent 20 minutes reconciling these two vastly different versions of the ESA bill that had passed in the House and Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2167)|
| 0:36:19| Only one voted against the bill, Senator Akbari voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And so it went then to the House and to the Senate to be adopted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| So lots of points were made in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| They discussed that school systems are funding more than the number of positions that the state has in its funding formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| and that there are almost 10,000 licensed employees that local communities are paying 100% of their salaries across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2203)|
| 0:36:53| The current version very clearly states that undocumented immigrants cannot receive vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| And the problem with that is that it's unconstitutional, and there's no one in the Senate who believes that that will hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2221)|
| 0:37:14| However, there was quite a bit of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Unconstitutional to ask for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| For documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Because what we have said is that to have a working society, we need educated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2243)|
| 0:37:36| So whether our children are here documented or not, it has been historically the goal to educate everyone so that everyone can contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2256)|
| 0:37:50| So that was a large concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| And if I may, excuse me, for those listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Just so you know, when any student presents themselves to Knox County Schools or any school in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| we are not allowed to ask about their immigration status or citizenship at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| So as a system, this is not something that we have ever been allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| And while I'm there, I was going to do the House first and then go to the Senate, but this is a good time to go ahead and jump one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| Senator Gardenhire is extremely concerned about this particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| And Senator Gardenhire has carried a voucher bill for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| He has always been very, very, very pro-voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| He is very against this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| He also noted that he has a bumper sticker from the 70s that was pro-voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| And he has always supported vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| But this bill, he absolutely did not because it had changed that piece that he feels is extremely unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2340)|
| 0:39:10| So I'm going to go back to the House part now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Some folks said that we've been looking at the bill for several days, even though it had just come out that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| Representative Gloria Johnson asked the Statehouse representatives to please talk with experts in the field they are legislating for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| such as teachers, school administrators, superintendents, and school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| And she asked that they carefully consider what experts in the field were telling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| instead of just what they were getting from outside sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| People repeatedly pointed out that the legislators who are voting for the bill are unwilling to vote for it if it includes their counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| However, there are many counties that do have priority schools that are not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| There were a lot of questions about why the legislator is unwilling to look at proven programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| which could positively impact entire schools or entire districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| In the end, the bill passed the House 50-46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Two members had abstained, but they changed their votes to make the vote 52-46 in favor of vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| The Senate discussion was taken up this afternoon at 1.30 Central Time, 2.30 Eastern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| and their discussion ended five minutes before our meeting began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| The ESA voucher bill was at the top of the agenda, but it was rolled back further and further and further as they discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| because the fiscal note for the bill had not been presented during the House vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| and so they voted without fully having the knowledge that it could cost significantly more than they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| There are multiple versions of fiscal notes, what it's believed to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| There's one version that says it will be $325 million per year, and the math supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2458)|
| 0:41:10| It is felt that that is probably not, it's not a probable number because fewer students generally actually move into the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2470)|
| 0:41:22| so they feel like that number is very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| However, regardless of what the number ends up being, there's general agreement that it costs double what each student costs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2485)|
| 0:41:36| and that there's not enough money in the budget that's been approved to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| So they are looking at a $37 million cost, and they have $25 million in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| So that was what was part of this scrambling to figure out exactly where the numbers were coming from and what they were really saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2509)|
| 0:41:59| There was also a strong feeling that a reasonable number for them to look at is $125 million cost per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| So without anyone being able to say, this is what we really expect it to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| they moved to a lengthy discussion about being fiscally conservative and fiscally responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| and many senators discussed how irresponsible it would be to vote for a bill that they don't know what it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2542)|
| 0:42:33| However, at around 4.55 our time, it was passed 19-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| Generally speaking, our delegation senators, more of our senators supported public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2562)|
| 0:42:52| Fewer of our House members supported public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| And so if we want to look at those names later, we could, but I won't do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| I may be inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| All right. Any comments or questions of Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| Seeing none, do I have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Motion by Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Second by Satterfield. All in favor? We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190513May01?start=2599)|
