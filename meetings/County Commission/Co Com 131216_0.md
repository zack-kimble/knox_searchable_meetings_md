| 0:03:30| and the clerk in question actually did enter the correct birth date, which declined the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=210)|

| 0:07:46| We'll pay the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=466)|

| 0:08:43| and we'll be able to give your testimony before this board at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| At this time, I'll ask Wolfie to come back up and provide testimony, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| On November 14, 2013, conducted an underage beer sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Raceway 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, bought six-pack Bud Light cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| Wolfie, did they ask for ID on that sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| If I could say something about some of the people that we're catching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| The gentleman that I cited is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| He had not been to a tips class and basically did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| He just misfigured it in his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| That's one of the things about selling alcohol before you've been to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| I think the state law says they have 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| but that's really a liability for the company that they work for because they do not know the rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=587)|
| 0:09:55| Ms. Sadik, how do you plea in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| Guilty, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Would you like to provide testimony before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Tim was employed under 60 days, probably the first week he was in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| We have him scheduled for the next available class, which is December 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And he just wanted to say exactly what happened, and we're extremely sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| This is our first offense, and this will not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| My name is Timothy Hamren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| I live at 1824 Scarlet Oak Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Basically, this is my first week on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| I've been there less than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| I really hadn't had much register experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I just came up to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| There's a lot of people in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| I got a little flustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| I misfigured the date and ran the sale anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Ms. Sadik, I think we've had another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| this is your first offense as this owner group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| But I think your family had the previous ownership of this business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| It was actually my brother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| His father was the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| He's deceased now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| And my brother-in-law made a new corporation and under new ownership and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| Virtually the same family running the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Well, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Wolfie, what's the history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Commissioner Brown, you didn't have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| I want to refer to Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I just had a question for the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| So in terms of, I know you miscalculated the date, but to my knowledge, that license looks a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| than probably the one that you have, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| You know, the stakes to me has gone the extra mile to try to make sure that there's no really good reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=717)|
| 0:12:10| or excuse for not recognizing that, hey, there's at least something different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| I need to slow down because, you know, there's a big under 21 stripe on that one and a red badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| Was that what you looked at is my question to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I was unaware of the stripe until the officer told me about it earlier today because I haven't had the class yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| So I wasn't 100% sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| So, Ms. Sadiq, it's a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So in terms of you starting an employee within that 60-day band or when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=758)|
| 0:12:47| is it generally your practice just to kind of let them loose at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Do you give them some general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| No, we do train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| We train them and they're well aware they cannot sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| We tell them to put the date of birth into the register, and it prompts to void the sale if it's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| You know, and I'm kind of like Commissioner Andrews with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| We've seen this raceway here in my tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| We're going on five, six times, I would say, dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| You know, we've gotten letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| We've gotten promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| We've gotten a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| But still, by annual basis almost, in my opinion, you know, at least every six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| we're seeing someone representing that entity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| And that really is bothersome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| So I'll put that as we deliberate, but I just want to put that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| That basically was my question, going to be my question to Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| How many times actually has this particular store been sited in the last three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| That's where we can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| I've got it right here, Wolfie, if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| I think it's at least three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| The previous permit, I think, was Hassan Sadiq, July 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| That was his first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Mohammed Sadiq, July 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| And also 2012, there was a death in the family there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| And this offense on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| So it's been every year for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| I've also, on one of them, I cited the same girl twice in the same day, if you remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| And we have seemingly a family, even though you keep passing around and this is your actual first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=883)|
| 0:14:53| the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, seemingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And this can't go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| We might do the one, you know, the lesser penalty today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| But in my opinion, if it comes back with you a second time, it's revoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| I'm going to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| All three of these have been in my district, which I appreciate you, Wolfie, for being out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| But I'm going to make a motion of a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension, the choice of the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=920)|
| 0:15:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| According to the law director, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=940)|

| 0:23:07| The second reading that was you got, I think you all have a copy of it, closure of the federal road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| and the public right of way at Kelly Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| We're going to add those two items into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Is that Norman or Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Who's live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Let's get them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Dwight, can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| Are we still pulling the Carnes senior or the Carnes convenience item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| It's to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| There's a companion resolution also that will need to be withdrawn as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| So 403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Withdrawal 403 and 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1433)|
| 0:24:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Yeah, 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Water plant road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| That deal has fallen away and we're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| I have 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| I need to postpone that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| It's a bridge on the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| There's an item to be added, Dr. McIntyre's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| The education consent, an item of Dr. McIntyre's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| If you'd like, we'll vote on that separately, but it's to be added to education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Resolution 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| And all these items will require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| So we've got to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| So I want to make sure that everybody's aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Any other additions or subtractions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Do I hear a motion to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Mr. Law Director, you explain that about the superintendent of the 210?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Any addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| This particular issue with the schools is a contract that we have a consent agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| We have a motion to put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| We don't have a two-thirds vote to put anything back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Once it's put on the agenda and the motion has been made to put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| So we are bound by our agreement to put prior contracts that are on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| or prior contracts that have been appropriated on consent, and that would be the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| So I just wanted to put you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| We have a valid court agreement concerning this topic, so I wanted to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Any other additions or subtractions or changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| So this vote, let me be sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| This vote is to put 210 on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| On the education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| We're voting on one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Well, no, if you want to separate that, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| But I was bundling it in with everything else that's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| I'd like to separate that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| So we'll take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Law directors, let's be clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| If it's not added to education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| You've got to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Let me explain, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| There's two things that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| If you do not vote to add it to education consent today, it will come back on education consent in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| You have no ---- you have to vote yes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I guess that's my question is I would like to bundle this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Do you just want Commissioner's preference on doing it separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| I'd just rather get it all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Well, I would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| But I think it's ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| I mean, there's nothing we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| I mean, so at the end of the day, we're going to move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| You're either going to do it today or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| But rather than vote no or pass on a whole bunch of items, I'd rather do that on one item that I'm doing a protest vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1629)|
| 0:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| We'll separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I'd like everything minus 210 to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Do I have a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| All the additions, subtractions, and changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1652)|

| 0:27:37| Now, I will make a motion to add 210 as an education consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=1657)|

| 0:41:18| But I will kind of give a thumbnail sketch of what we covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| Meeting eight of a ten-meeting commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| This project was privately funded to have a paid facilitator who we're used to working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2489)|
| 0:41:39| His name escapes me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I can't see his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Steve Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| So that February is going to be our last meeting under that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| And the committee will make some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I think the work has been well received by both bodies sitting on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| So we talked a lot about the information that the school board has gotten from teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2519)|
| 0:42:13| teacher surveys, teacher evaluation processes, what, you know, how we stack up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| They've gotten a lot of that information, you know, probably ad nauseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| But we talked last month about us wanting to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| some feel for what questions teachers are being asked in terms of a survey, what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| Is it independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Is it impartial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| And all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| So the plan was to have the superintendent present that information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| And we thought the lunch was probably a little too congested time period to really kind of dig in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| We don't want all the detail, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| but we want to take a deeper dive than a five or ten-minute sketch that the superintendent normally has available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| or the board chair, Ms. Fugate, has available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| So I think what we decided to do is the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and the school board chair is going to get together to try to discuss a retreat date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| And they'll go off and do some things, you know, school board related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| and we'll spend some time there with the superintendent talking with us about what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| And they'll have some data for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| One thing that's interesting, they actually had a survey that was disseminated in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| It was actually a couple of days before our meeting, so like the first or second of December, to the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| It was done as independent as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I think the only question was, are you elementary, middle, or high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Other than that, it was bubbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| You know, there was some fear of reprisal and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| But it was, you know, it kind of asked pointed questions to try to get some data out about the teacher, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| satisfaction with all the aspects of their job or several of the aspects of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| And then, but there is a point where they can write in information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And, you know, we kind of joked around the county doesn't hire a handwriting specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| so we don't think anyone's going to go back and look at all that handwriting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| But it is a good way to get information out there to let the teachers individually let them know, in terms of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2653)|
| 0:44:23| know how they, you know, feel about certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| So that one, they're actually hoping to get the results in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| The core results, you know, just from the bubble, you know, very likely, very satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| that sort of thing that we all take from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| But then the information that they write in, that's going to be a little more labor intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| So, again, we talked a lot about that and the joint retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And, you know, we've not gotten anyone saying that we do not want a joint retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| So we've been operating from the standpoint that that is something that the commission is wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| So we've empowered our chair and the school board has done likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| So they'll get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| And I think what we decided, Mike, what did we decide on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| More of a Saturday half day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| We talked about during the week, but that didn't seem to work for most people's schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| So I think we're looking maybe Friday evening, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And, again, be done by Saturday noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| That way it wouldn't take up a full weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah, Friday evening, Saturday, half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I count the flight back from Hilton Head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| And then we spent a lot of time talking about real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| And this was, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| I maybe drove that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| But in terms of some interesting information, and these are crude numbers coming from legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| and it's all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| So roughly 40 percent of the properties of the school properties belong to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Forty percent of them belong to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| And just in terms of what the deed, I'm not going to get into who it belongs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| I don't want to talk philosophical, but just on the deed, what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Forty percent Board of Education, 40 percent to Knox County, and 20 percent to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| So there are some schools that are actually titled in that school's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Bluegrass is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| It's titled to Bluegrass because I guess at one time that was a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| and they owned their own, you know, property, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Or maybe it was a deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| So we do need to get that, you know, in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| But the key is I think what no one wants to do is get in a big brouhaha over that, over who owns what property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2786)|
| 0:46:35| who owns, you know, whether it should all be school board, all be Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| That gets messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| But just to kind of understand a what there were three things that came out from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| Who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| The timing of the disposal of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| And then who gets the revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| So those are the three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Who cares who owns it at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| If we could solve these, who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| When are we going to access this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Are we going to let the property deteriorate to a point where we're not going to get the last one is the revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| So that was a good debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| Again, we're not a policymaking body, so we're not deciding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| But we are going to talk a lot about that, and there's going to be some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| So one thing we talked about was, you know, I don't know, six months, a year, plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| Present a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Okay, we're not in this facility anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| What's our plan for this building or this property or this series of buildings, set of buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| So that was something that was thrown about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| And then, again, just to create a process to vet what's the best use for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| Does the school still need it for something or another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| So just to standardize that process and make that process more transparent to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| because a lot of times we don't see it, we just see it sit for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And the point I made is, you know, these schools are in the heart of our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| and so a school goes kind of community drives that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| So if we let these properties go, sometimes it could take the community down with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| or raise the community up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| So that's something that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| So that was a ñ it was a ñ I think we ñ those are the main things that we addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Commissioner Hammond, you want to ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| No, I think you covered them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| And I think that we are contracted with Steve Joyner through February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| So we'll see if that continues on as the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| But I think he's done a great job in, you know, kind of moving us forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and getting the discussion focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| And I don't know if our membership on that was a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Was it from ñ I'm talking about a commissioner's ñ the four commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| Are we on there for a year and be reappointed, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I guess I'll look to the chair of the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I don't know how we came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I guess Commissioner Norman may know about it, more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| It's actually a chairman's appointment, so there's no terms on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| It's just kind of as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| I mean, so the chairman and, you know, the school board and the chair came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| So it's not a ñ we can make it however it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| There's no term on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Okay, I was just interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| But February is when he is last, and we'll see if that continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| I believe that he's not being funded by the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| but he's being funded by an independent group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| So hopefully they will continue to have him be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| And then Commissioner Wright and Burroughs, do you all want to say anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Question for you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Talking about the schools, was rural high school one of them that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| You know, and we talked about why ñ and, again, this is coming from a person that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| we all don't know all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| You know, South Knox High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Why so long to get on the books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Whereas Old North, Knox High, looks like they're really moving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| But rural high was a primary facility that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| Commissioner Norman, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| I guess I'd just like to ask a few questions about the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| I think Dr. McIntyre is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| He might be, though, if he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| I thought they had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| I saw you all stand up, and so I assumed you all had left the building, but please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| We got about five feet from the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| Commissioner, the survey that we're doing is about a 15-question survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| It's a paper survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So there had been some expression that, you know, our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| when if there's an electronic survey that it might be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| personally identifiable or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| And we want our teachers to be as candid as possible and as open as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| And so it's actually a paper survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| We distributed it last week or actually about a week and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| and we expect to get the completed survey, so it's a paper-pencil survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| back to us by the end of this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| and then compile those over the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| and have some data to share with the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| and with the Joint Education Group in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Did the survey go to all teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| It went to all schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| So what we asked is that because it's a paper survey that it went to all schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| to be administered at a faculty meeting sometime in the two-week period before the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And who composed the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Our folks, our research specialists in the Accountability Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| helped compose the questions, but they're basically based on the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and questions and concerns that have been raised over the last few weeks and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| So there are questions about announced versus unannounced observation visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| There are questions about whether we should do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| in terms of evaluation for teachers who score Level 5, the highest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| And then there's a series of questions at the end that are taken directly from the TEL survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| which is a biannual survey of all teachers in the state of Tennessee that sort of speak to the work environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| and the culture and how things are going in the school and in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Did you have any teacher input on the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I mean, other than what's your group, the group that you had that composed the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Did you have anybody review the survey before it went out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| The president of the Knox County Education Association reviewed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and I also gave the chairman and the chair of the joint education group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| on the commission an opportunity to review it before it went out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| So did the KCEA president have a committee or something look at the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| or how did she give input on the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| She gave feedback, and we responded to that feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and actually made several changes based on her feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Okay, and when will we hear about results from the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| In January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Any other discussion on the joint education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3200)|

| 0:53:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| All right, there's no more business before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| Does anybody have any announcements for their community or their district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| I need to speak to Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Hugh Holt, please report to the concession stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| Didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3228)|

| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Raise your hand, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| A little bit of house cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| We need to ordinance 13-11-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| We need to have a public meeting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| So I need to entertain a motion to delay until the next zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3336)|

| 0:55:38| So moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| The public meeting will be after our workshop in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| Motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3347)|

| 0:55:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I'd like to take the agenda and kind of move the Emory Church to the end so we can dispose of the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3354)|
| 0:56:11| and then we'll discuss that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| So, Madam Clerk, if you'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| I think that's the one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| It's a single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Move it to the end, and then we'll proceed with the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| Item number 11-B-13-RZ is a request of Bonnie Thomas for rezoning from May Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| to R.B. General Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| The property is located at North End, Mays Drive, north of Perrywinkle Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Is there any opposition to Perrywinkle Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| For MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3421)|

| 0:57:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Item 11-D-13-RZ is a request of the Development Corporation of Knox County for rezoning from May Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| to E.C. Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| The property is located south side of Garrison Drive, south of Boomerang Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| The applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Todd is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| I believe that there's some opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| I know Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Okay, Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Any others that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Todd, if you want to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3459)|
| 0:58:08| He's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3488)|
| 0:58:24| Go ahead, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| I'm Todd Napier with the Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| number 201 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I have a few people here with me that are professionals in the field of engineering, environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| and geotechnical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| If we have some questions about that, then I may call on to help me answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| I want to start off saying that I'm here not on behalf of myself or our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| but I'm here on behalf of the Development Corporation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| It's a board made up of public officials as well as private sector citizens who are committed to working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| for the overall good of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| The Development Corporation submitted an application to NPC last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| which they overwhelmingly supported, to update 70 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| the Butler property in the northwest county sector plan from LDR to light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| and to be rezoned from ag to EC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Development Corporations is our intent to develop the properties of Business Park that will be similar in character to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Westbridge Business Park, which is just to the south, but much smaller in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And we do this in order to facilitate job growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| Some of you may remember Dr. Butler, who was a long-time veterinarian in the Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| He passed away back in 2007 and took several years to settle his estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| But they did so, and they've been marketing this property as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| I was contacted by a representative of the family to see if we had an interest in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| since it became known that Knox County had an interest in completing the Carnes connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| So I did a little bit of investigation on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| and did find out that it had moved to the top of the capital and priorities project list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| and that it was later funded in May by this body to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| So the completion of this final half-mile section of Carnes Valley Drive is much needed for the transportation network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| for Carnes and surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| And when it comes complete, it comes within two-tenths of a mile, as you can see from these maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| and what I passed out of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| And with the improvements proposed to the west end of Garrison Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| it basically gives direct access to Oak Ridge Highway to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| and through Westbridge Business Park to Hardin Valley Road to I-140, 40 and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| So in addition to the great roadway access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| there are several factors that make this property appropriate for what we're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| There's two large TVA transmission lines that transect the property diagonally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| And these are very compatible with manufacturing-type uses, but typically not so much for, like, single-family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| This is classical infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Well, this is a fairly large piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| It is surrounded by suburban development, houses, schools, utilities, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| So it has all the infrastructure in place, which makes for very efficient use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| The North City Utility Board has a large substation adjacent to the property that has excess capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| West Knox Utility District just installed a 24-inch and 36, excuse me, 30-inch water trunk lines through the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| There's sanitary sewer and natural gas within very close proximity to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| The existing zoning to the south and much to the east is already zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And if you look, Carnes High School is actually still zoned industrial because it was actually built in an industrial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| And there's rail in close proximity to the site, which is very unique for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| and really for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| It comes up to the southwest corner of the property, and we're working with CSX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| and those property owners to extend it into the site, which would be to make it more suited for industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| excuse me, employment-centered zoning and manufacturing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Also, this property is located in what we call a sweet spot for companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| It's between Oak Ridge National Lab, the airport, downtown Knox, University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| Pellissippi State is five minutes away and just eight minutes to I-4075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| Workforce is very strong in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| You know, we've got tradition of the DOE assets, a lot of skilled workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| And then we've got a lot of highly educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Sixty-three percent of the population within a 15-minute drive of this site has a bachelor's degree or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| When you compare that to the state average of 20, excuse me, state of Tennessee at 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| Knox County at 34, and the U.S. at 28, you can see it would be very attractive to employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| Commissioners, with the pending completion of this final section of Carnes Valley Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| anyone would be very hard-pressed to find another location in all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| that's better suited for a business park development to recruit, grow manufacturing jobs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Knox County needs this property rezoned, this employment center, and it's perfectly well suited for that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| So I respectfully ask that you consider the overall welfare of the citizens of Knox County and approve this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3801)|
| 1:03:31| Any discussion items currently for Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| Todd, I guess one question I have is the E.C. zoning versus industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Does it provide, correct me if I'm wrong, because some of the residents that I've spoken to have talked about the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Does it provide for more strict regulations than an industrial zoning on the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| If you look at Westbridge, it's zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| But by design standards restrictive covenants that we put on and ran with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| it calls for certain design standards and covenants related to landscaping, location of loading docks, additional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3839)|
| 1:04:08| So the employment center zoning by ordinance places mandates those requirements on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| There's also another level of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| We will come back with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| And what I've done right here is, and I've passed out to you, is really kind of to flesh that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| It's a lot of landscape screening requirements as well as type of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| So there's a list of uses that are listed that are permissible in the E.C. zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| We have to come back with our development plan to say these are the specific type of uses within that list that would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| So there's another level of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| And then once that's set in place, then each project that comes in has to be reviewed against that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| So all that's by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| And one change I think I've seen on this drawing that I didn't see on previous drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Is that a walking trail you've placed in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| So we, you know, we had a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| We had a community input session, talked to the folks at Carnes High School, listened to the last planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| So what we've done is to try to create some community amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| A walking trail is about 1.3 miles loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| And also then to connect it back to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| The school will permit that over to the neighborhood on Boomerang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| Even put in some parking spaces that will allow for people that live close by there to drive to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| and be able to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| My name is Carolyn Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| I live at 3224 Boomerang Lane in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| It's code 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| I'm here representing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I do live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Boomerang is the street that comes north, going north, just north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| I think everybody has gotten an e-mail from me, so I'm not going to repeat everything that I would say otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| and I'll just be kind of brief with my remarks or try to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| The main reason I'm here is just because I want you to know what you're voting for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| or what you're approving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| The main problem, I guess I have two or three different problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| The main problem, I think, is that it's right next to a school that they want to put this employment center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| Now, they were a little more up front about what that means than I've seen in some of the other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| that we've met up here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Employment center zoning is an industrial kind of classification, and it does not belong next to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| In fact, it specifically says in the ordinance you can't have a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| or a secondary school in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| It doesn't say why, but you can guess that it's probably because industrial zones do have frequently hazardous kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| They frequently have hazardous materials maybe that are stored that can have different kinds of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| explosions, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Different things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| It also could be because this is going to be a difficult place then to have walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| I mean, typically you don't want kids walking through an industrial zone to get to school either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| So this is going to severely limit what we were hoping would become a walkable area at some point when this grew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| because it was supposed to be residential originally, according to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| So it's putting the kids at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| And not only that, it's situated so badly because the athletic fields are what is going to be abutting this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| I mean, it really couldn't be placed any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| You know, if the school had even been turned around, it might have helped just a little bit to have something blocking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| And maybe they can, I'm sure they'll come up with a plan that puts some trees or something in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| But it's really not where, if you were siting a school, you wouldn't want to put a school next to an industrial area like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| So why would you want to do the flip and put an industrial area next to a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| EPA has siding guidelines for schools, and they say you should try to avoid this type of thing if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| If it's not possible, then you try to do all the mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| But what you're doing, if you approve this, is you're setting us up for a lot of mitigating kinds of factors down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| We're going to be having to deal with this when we could just stop it now and say this is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| And it really has not been talked about much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Todd said something about talking to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I'm glad to hear that finally happened because I was not hearing the school brought it to this at all up until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| And so I'm glad to hear that at least they're aware, I guess, or somebody over there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| But this is a serious decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| And kids, especially because they're not fully grown, they are affected more by air pollution, that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| so that especially if they're out on the football field, you know, exerting themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| you can just bet that there's going to be more incidents of asthma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| And I'm not just talking about air pollution coming out of stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| I'm talking about fugitive emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I'm talking about diesel from trucks, truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| I mean, there's a lot of different type of businesses you could put there that you might think are benign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| but in accumulating circumstances, and there's other business parks maybe a mile down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| You know, some of this accumulates, and it's going to be something that is difficult to measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| but you'll see it in terms of increased asthma rates and possibly even cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| depending on what kinds of substances are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| So I think this is serious, and I don't feel like it's been given enough attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| So, you know, if anything, I would say you should defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| and talk about it some more with the people that can give you more information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| But I'd say you ought to just say zoning is just wrong to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Another problem is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Five hundred jobs is going to be a lot of traffic for little bitty Garrison Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| I know the Carnes Connector is going to be on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| That's great, but that's not enough because I know people are going to be going out to the commercial area of Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| If they're working there, they're going to be going to the drug store or to the post office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| or the commercial, the fast food joints, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| So Garrison Road is going to have to be widened, which also means you're going to end up widening Byington Beaver Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| which the engineers for the county have said is extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| They might be able to make it three lanes, but that's the most they've said they really can do, they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| This, I think, with that many more cars on it, you're going to need to go to four lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| and it's like a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| You know, this is going to mean the road has to be, that Garrison has to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| That knocks down the next domino, that Byington Beaver Ridge has to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| And then that goes to the Carnes, the so-called Carnes red light that everybody probably has heard of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| where our first traffic signal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| That whole area, according to the county sector plan, if you don't do, if you put too many cars on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| and do widen to four lanes the Byington Beaver Ridge, that's going to be a, I forget the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| It's basically going to be like a sea of traffic and concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| I mean, they basically said that our hopes for Carnes downtown area of ever being very walkable will go right out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| So this has effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I mean, it doesn't get talked about much, and a lot of the neighbors think that it's either, I see my time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| One more sentence, if you'll let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| A lot of the neighbors, I think, have been misled into thinking that this is better than some kind of very dense housing going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| But that's, why is that our only choice between two inappropriate uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| I mean, it would be nice to go by the sector plan, which said an appropriate use ought to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| and then we can have Carnes develop into what we could have be a walkable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| and a really nice place to continue to raise kids and live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| I just love Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| That's the reason I'm here, and I would love to see it continue being a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| I think a lot of these issues have not been given the right attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Yeah, is there any questions for Ms. Greenwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Anybody else in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| I'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Ron, you came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Mr. Osborne, you came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| Seeing none, I'll make a motion to go ahead and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| But before I do that, too, I want to thank you for holding the community meeting that you held in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| You had a good crowd there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| And I'm tickled with Dwight and Cindy and Jim, what you all did on this road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| I think that's what sells the whole thing is where you extend this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| and get that road going out to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| I appreciate, Dwight, what your people did on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Per MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| I have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| I can't see you behind all the screens and posters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| Who did you meet with at the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| And I met with a couple of folks from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| From the main office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Did you meet with anybody from the PTA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Any of the parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| They showed up at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| I would think there were a few at the meeting, but they didn't represent themselves in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| So it wasn't publicized that there was going to be a school meeting about it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| I had a community meeting because I believe it's community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| and I met with the school because they were an adjoining property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Where was the community meeting held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| It was held in the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| Todd, can you tell me how much industrial is already around the Carnes High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| If you look at this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4396)|
| 1:13:39| The school is zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| This is some of the very little bit of land that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| I know I've been before this body before and obviously it was unsuccessful in another park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| but this property is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| It has utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| It has the road network, or it will in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| It has a railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| I mean, this is where industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| This is one of the few places in Knox County left for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| And we can do it in such a way, particularly with employment center zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| they'll have a minimum impact on the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| And I understand Ms. Greenwood's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| I don't think it's legitimate related to pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I believe that we have regulations and competent people that will make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| and we don't want pollution any more than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| But, you know, this is an appropriate place, and the traffic will be directed to the connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| Are you planning, if this goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| are you planning more community input sessions as this gets developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| You know, we'll be working on this plan right here, which is the development plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| And there will be opportunities for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| And we can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Certainly would make that available and open to the public to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| That will have to go through use on review too, won't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| It will go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Maybe Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| There's a development plan that has to be approved, which has to go back before planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| And then each project itself will be measured against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Maybe Mark can better clarify if that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| In this case, the employment center zone requires the approval of a development plan by the planning commission prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| any permitting of actual development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| And in doing so, we require architectural drawings, landscaping plan, lighting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| restrictive covenants in this case if they put in place design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| So prior to the development of any particular lot or parcel within the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| there will be a development plan approval, which requires a public hearing at the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Mr. Greenwood, you can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| On paper, it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| But that's too little too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Because if you look at a lot of it, I've looked around the country for examples of where these kind of things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Zoning is what does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Zoning is what protects you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Zoning is what you need to get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Because after it's zoned for industrial, you are limited as to what you can object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| They're going to put out plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| And as long as those plans are compatible with that, we're not going to be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| that's wrong, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Because it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| It's already zoned that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Zoning is where the rubber really hits the road to get you that protection that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| And I've seen this all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I had no idea even that zoning was that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| But once you get the zoning right, then you can make development plans that you can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| But otherwise, it's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| The other thing about nobody wants pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Well, yeah, that's all real nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| It's the same thing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Your hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| After you get something like industrial in there, you have to let those businesses, once the plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| you have to let businesses that meet those criteria in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| And all air quality can do at that point is whatever the law says, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| you can only emit so much, you have to put these kind of controls on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| But that's not going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| That's not the kind of thing that what you need is to say they shouldn't be that close to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Because anything that comes out of there is going to start accumulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Anything that's next to that football field doesn't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| And once you say employment center zoning is okay or industrial is okay, you're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| Even if air pollution folks want to try to minimize that, you're back on that mitigation thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| We're going to be mitigating, mitigating, mitigating our way out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| I'll go to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| It's going to be painful because it's going to be all about mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| When it should be about get that thing out of there, it shouldn't be there to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Let's put an application or a classification that belongs there next to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| not something that we have to mitigate our way out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Also, you should know Carnes has tons of business parks already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| I mean, we've got like 99 acres that's available about a mile down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| We've got another, what, 30 acres or something and another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Why is Carnes becoming the business park for the rest of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| This is not that flat either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| This is the only property they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| This is also hillside protection land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| So, it's not, you know, he makes it sound like it's flat and it's completely conducive to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| This was all zoned and it was hillside protection and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| So, be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Where's the 99 acres that are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| That's Hardin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Is it called Hardin Valley Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Hardin Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| It's not 99 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| It's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I forget what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Hardin Business Park has about 60 to 65 developable acres depending on how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| Some of it we used as buffer and setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| Yeah, that was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I got the 99 from some website thing that they put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Maybe it's total 99, but only 60-somethings developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| But I got the, I can get the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| But, yeah, it just, this is, I can't believe this is the only place they can do this and that they will destroy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| our plans as a community because they want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| I mean, there's really nothing changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Circumstance, I've lived there for 20 years almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I mean, they even have an application where they're supposed to fill out for the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| What changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| You have to show that so you can get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Nothing changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| I mean, their answer sounded like a kid trying to fake the answer on an exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| I mean, it was pitiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| It was like, well, you know, it's got to be kind of go along with industrial in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| Industrial, it hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| All those lines have been there for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| They shouldn't have gotten past MPC staff to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| But everybody wants to do it because it's jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| I think jobs are great, but they shouldn't destroy our community for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you for letting me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| We have a motion and a second to approve per MTC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4798)|

| 1:20:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| The aye is carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4809)|

| 1:20:10| Item is on page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| It's 11-C-13-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| It's a request of the Development Corporation of Knox County for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| from LDR, Low Density Residential, and HP Hillside Protection to LI, Light Industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| and HP Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| The property is located south side of Garrison Drive, south of Boomerang Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| Same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| There's our motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| The motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| I didn't ask for discussion before I announced the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Any nays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Now we're back to page 21, Item 9-A-13-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| It's a request of Huber Properties Clearwater Partners LLC for rezoning from A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| and F Floodway to PR Plan Residential and F Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| The property is located northeast and southwest sides of Emory Church Road in I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| north of Henderson Lane in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| The applicant's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| That was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Is the we really haven't set rules for this many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| Mr. Klein, are you speaking on behalf of the total opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| I am, unless there's other people that show up in opposition that I don't represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| So I'm hearing no's behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| So there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Well, what we'll do is we'll let the proposed applicant make their opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| We'll hear from Mr. Klein and we'll hear from some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| But we don't want to get to where we're repetitive in our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| So if we get to that point, we will kind of slow down and do rebuttals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| And so, Mr. Hubert, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| Is it okay if we defer and let the opposition speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Yeah, that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I mean, I don't know that that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Yeah, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| We'd like to defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4942)|
| 1:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Well, thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| My name is Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| And on behalf of the opposition of this proposed development, those in opposition, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4960)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| I also have a petition signed by 438 people in opposition that I'm submitting as part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| I've been working in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| You can sit down, folks, for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| And in the process of representing clients and meeting and appearing before various bodies in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| and the city of Knoxville, I realized that zoning is all about quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| We're all talking about this quality of life in our community at large, the quality of our local subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| and of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| But by its very nature, zoning is not about putting commercial enterprises like Home Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| or Kroger and shopping malls next to residential areas because they're lit up, they create traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| they create noise, and they're not appropriate for the residential character of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| The Huber Clearwater proposal hits on all fours with the notion of inappropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| That is why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| The MPC commissioners basically punted you this rezoning request, and their recommendation is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| and also is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| The Knoxville News Sentinel, I think you read it last week, last Wednesday, had an editorial on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Among other things, it said process promotes rational conclusions over arbitrary decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5047)|
| 1:24:15| Properly designed and followed good public processes reduce the likelihood of corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| Arbitrary decisions undermine the confidence of residents, business owners, and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| who rely on consistent rulings to plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| Commissioners need to respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| That's what it said in the editorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| And the editorial failed to address the real lack of legitimate process in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| It did not discuss that MPC director, executive director, Mr. Mark Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| and his staff based their recommendations for the approval of the Huber Clearwater proposal on plan ET,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5088)|
| 1:24:56| the informal discussions of a regional community partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| a proposal which has not been adopted by Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| and is not a part of the Tennessee zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| In his comments at the pre-agenda review on this application and to the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| the commissioner at the November 14, 2013, meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| Mr. Donaldson repeatedly said that plan ET is the genesis for the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| He pointedly ignores the general plan 2033 and the southwest sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| both prepared with notice, public input of Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| and adopted by you, Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| MPC ignores the low-density development of the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| and the lack of changes that could warrant an amendment to the southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Mr. Donaldson justified the maximum request for five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| saying that one of the adjacent properties is zoned one to five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| Now, I've given you some handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| and the first page is kind of a synopsis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| It goes around this area and shows you the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| and the density calculations of the properties about the surrounding mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| I've put an X on Mr. Huber's proposed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| and there's a circle around one of the Xs that I'm going to talk about that's 17.6 acres that is undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| But if you take a look at that, I've put a little church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| Children's Hospital Church and Church over areas that he's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| when he's referring to this one parcel that's next door that's one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| A density of one to five per acre does not mean a density of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| It can mean one, 1.5, or whatever you all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| And let me point out to you that while the adjacent property Mr. Donaldson talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| is located at the northeast corner of Westland Drive and the Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| and is zoned at a density of one to five, the property, number one, fronts on Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| and number two is developed only with a church and soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| It's not developed one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Considering location only, the frontage of the church property is quite unlike the property here before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Which is accessible only by a minor road and lies mostly underneath the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| Now the Knox County General Plan 2033 describes the appropriate process before us in this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5254)|
| 1:27:43| The Tennessee Planning Enabling Legislation requires any planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| or municipality with a zoning ordinance prepare a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| That's what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| The plan must at a minimum address the general location, the character, and the extent of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| Now MPC staff presented the draft of the Knox County General Plan at a series of public meetings in the spring of 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| Inspiring further refinements and ideas which are included in the final draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| which was then presented for adoption to the Planning Commission, City Council, and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| Presentations on the final draft took place in the winter of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| And you, the Knox County Commission, adopted that general plan on May 27, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| And importantly to the properties before you today, the plan provides how density is to be calculated for a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| The Knox County Plan states, and I'll refer you to page two of my handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| density for residential development will be based upon the amount of usable acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| excluding areas which are underwater, in floodways, have steep slopes, or are otherwise undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5331)|
| 1:29:01| Two-thirds of the property that's before you here today is characterized by steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| The Knox County General Plan provides a policy to deal with lack of usability of land on steep slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| and that's page three of your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| It says restrict development on slopes greater than 15 percent and along streams and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| Housing densities on 15 to 25 percent slopes are limited to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| Housing density on slopes greater than 25 percent, one dwelling unit per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| The MPC staff ignored these provisions in its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| During the 14th of November meeting, MPC staff member, Mr. Brousseau, stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| we, the community, had properly calculated the density allowed on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| under the general plan at about three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Following that interchange, there was a discussion between Commissioner Michael Cain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| and MPC Executive Director, Mr. Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| And it's about four pages long, and I'm not going to read the whole thing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| But basically what Mr. Donaldson said, and I've quoted to you, and you may see it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| handed out by somebody else, is that the MPC recommendation was not guided by the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| It was not guided by the Southwest sector plan, but in fact was guided by this plan ET| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| because we need to have high density close to intersections of interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| That's not in our plan, folks, and that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| And that's why we're upset because we all bought our homes, mostly single-family residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| out in the Southwest sector, because we knew by participating in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| by having a voice and notice and process that we could build houses, spend our lives' fortunes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5455)|
| 1:31:05| our wealth, and have homes that we could rely on that would not be built next to 324 apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5465)|
| 1:31:14| a Home Depot or some other commercial development like a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| Mr. Cain asked Mr. Donaldson pointedly towards the end of their conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5482)|
| 1:31:32| you're either saying that there's up to one to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| and that is categorical because that is what the county allows, or you're saying we have to have hilltop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| It seems to me that we're basing all this recommendation on the fact that you have a corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| a transportation corridor, and that we have an exit, an interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| I'm not sure that the community as a whole has bought into that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| Mr. Donaldson's statement, that is a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| It's not fun to sit up here and indict Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| It's not fun to be part of a community that's being overwhelmed by a plan ET,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| but it's also not proper process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| Each planned unit development shall be compatible with the surrounding or adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| That's page four of my handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| But it's also in Article 5.13.01 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| It's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| This proposed development is not compatible with adjacent zones or with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5554)|
| 1:32:43| What's next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Take a look at page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Page seven, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| I've got a before and after mock drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| It's a mock drawing because we don't know what it's going to look like, and I don't want to mislead anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| But it shows the Benson Home at the top picture, and it shows a four-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| and three-story apartment building, but that's as close as it's going to be to the Benson Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| The general plan requires that the density for residential development will be based upon the amount of usable acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| and that excludes undevelopable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| We have 17.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| If you take a look on page six of my handout, there's 17.6 acres to the west of the Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5604)|
| 1:33:39| that are undevelopable because it's inaccessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| You can't get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| And if you can't get to a piece of property, you can't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| The general plan requires that we exclude undevelopable property from density calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5628)|
| 1:33:57| And so that 17.6 acres, which the MPC included, should be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| And that's where we have a problem with the density calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| And their density calculation, MPC's is 172, and they add to it, and I'll talk about that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| But ours is 127 if you exclude those 17.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| Why do you exclude them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| You can't get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| On the north part of the 17.6 acres is Hampton Hall subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| It's all covered with houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| You can't get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| On the other side is Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| There's no access from Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| On the west side is Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| It's part of a park property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Now, I've heard people say, well, can't we get through there to get to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| When TVA deeded Knox County that property, they said, we're going to restrict this to recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| And if you don't use it for recreational use, it comes back to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| No, you can't access it through Knox County park property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| The only other way to access it, you have to build a bridge from one side of this property over the lake to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| And you can't get to it because there's no bridge proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| Because it's inaccessible, it's undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Because it's undevelopable, you can't use it in the density calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| Our community is enraged that Mr. Huber's property application has portrayed the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| as preferring the entire property be clear-cut for single-family residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| This is a false portrayal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| We're also enraged that Huber Properties presents their project as a tremendous improvement to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| This is an insult to each and every one of us whose properties are directly adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| or in the neighborhood of this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| The single-family homes right next door are worth much more than I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5749)|
| 1:36:00| According to the developer's engineering traffic study, this development adds 2,928 average daily vehicle trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5760)|
| 1:36:11| to this already failed roadway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And that does not include truck and boat trips from the proposed marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| The schools affected include A.L. Lots Elementary, West Valley Middle, and Bearden High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| School buses already travel and will continue to travel Emory Church Road from A.L. Lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| to West Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| And this proposed development with this many trips per day, 2,928, just out of one development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| not only makes this road more dangerous, but makes the trip through the area treacherous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| especially passing through this proposed development and at the intersection of Fox Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| and Emory Church Road where the railroad crossing comes in, Fox Road meets Emory Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| and it's a very dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| The traffic study says it's a level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| It's treacherous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| And it cannot be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| So instead of saying we shouldn't do this development here, there's an effort in the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| and you may hear Ms. Pianchi say this too, to say all this traffic will probably go to Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5833)|
| 1:37:21| because we're going to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| But that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| What happens already is because traffic backs up on the interstate from Kingston Pike all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| beyond Westland Drive, people take Emory Church Road to get through to their destinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| That's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| It's going to continue to happen, and some of these people, if not all of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| at this proposed development, if it were to be built, would do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| making a very treacherous road very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| And it's an inappropriate road to put this kind of development on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| The recent traffic study is also incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| While it addresses traffic flow onto Westland from Emory Church, it does not address traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| from Moorfield Road that is at the eastern edge of Traymore Village, creating a five-way intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Emory Church, Traymore Way, Moorfield Road, east and westbound lanes of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| It doesn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| So it's not going to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| I don't care what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| They can put a light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| It's not going to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| And Emory Church Road is not going to be fixed because you can't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| You can't widen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| You can't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| This development will overshadow estate-sized lots with single-family residential dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| and at least one or more homes will actually be in the sun's shadow from the apartment shadow from buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| proposed by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| It's unsuitable for the neighborhood and the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| and the marina will generate increased noise and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5937)|
| 1:39:09| Mr. Huber's proposals are not compatible with the surrounding and adjacent zones, and therefore, you must say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5949)|
| 1:39:18| to the MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| What is the remedy here for the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| Simply say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| Reject the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I'm going to talk a little bit about the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| I don't know whether you've all got it, but you were sent a videotape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| and I put it as part of the record that talks about the environment out here, and it's a special place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5979)|
| 1:39:48| And for Mr. Huber to say he's going to be an environmentalist is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| because he's going to move dirt from one side of Emory Church to the other side of Emory Church just to build this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| And then he says, I'm going to put conservation easements and walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| You can't build there anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| So to his credit, he gets to say, I can't build there anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I'll become an environmentalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| That's not what this project is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| It's an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| It's inappropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| And Sinking Creek is an environmentally sensitive area and has been identified by Knox County as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| quote, critical sinkhole watershed, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| It's within three-quarters mile of the sinkhole that opened up on the polo club lane in Gettysview during September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| of 2013, and the site is well-known by the locals for its caves and the endangered berry salamander, the sharpshin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6034)|
| 1:40:43| the cooperhawk, the mallards, the blue heron, the bald eagles, the ospreys, and these birds are nesting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6043)|
| 1:40:52| With the exception of the level portion of the north side of the property, the topography of this embayment has steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| slopes with a 200-foot elevation change from the top of the hill to the creek level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| The proposed development site is located three miles from where Sinking Creek flows into Fort Loudon Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| The water levels in this area are significantly reduced in the winter, restricting the draft and size of boats that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| even consider use of a proposed marina and a marine dry storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| Sinking Creek is already on TDEC's bacteriological advisory list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| Addition of a third marina and dry storage places an escalated environmental risk on an already sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| The Holston Geologic Formation, which underlies this property boundary, has a nine-foot, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| a nine-fold higher likelihood of encountering a cave or surface sinkhole than any other formation in our valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6104)|
| 1:41:52| Getty's View posed many problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| They're not all resolved, and those were single-family dwellings, not four-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| Many who have on-the-ground knowledge of this area have pointed out existing caves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| and surface features that forecast subsurface issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| A development of this magnitude will totally change the semi-stable existing drainage in unknown but likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| costly ways that seem to have been all but ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| In fact, Mr. Huber, in order to get above TVA's high-water contour, will have to move fill from one side of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| property across Emery Church Road to create 20 feet of fill upon which to construct his buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| So 20 feet of fill from one area deposited on an already Swiss-cheed subsurface, that's not going to be stable, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6152)|
| 1:42:42| This is a bad project, not because it is an apartment complex, but because it has so many flaws and faults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| Perhaps as many as the shaky geology on which it is proposed to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| I'd ask that you spare us the agony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| I'd ask that you do the right thing and follow the Plan 2033.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| Follow the Southwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Follow the law that applies to this process and reject this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6182)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6192)|
| 1:43:24| Jolie, do we have a list of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Has anybody signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| That was roughly 20, 22 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| And so, John, if you'll or Mr. King, if you'll keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| Does anybody else in the opposition want to speak currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| What we're going to do is, in time's sake, we're going to go with five minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| I mean, Mr. Kline was representing a large amount of people, and I wanted to allow him some leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| But let's start with the five-minute rule, if that's okay with the commission, if that's favorable for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| unless there's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| So if you want to give your name and address, it's 550.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| You've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| My name is Mike Whitaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| I live at 823 Zola Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| I am one of the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| If you look in the request on page four where it gives the lots, I am lot number 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| and I'm speaking on behalf of several of the other residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| My parents live at lot 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Her brother and sister live at lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| My cousins are at 13.01 and 13.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| Again, I echo the things that Wayne said, so I'll be able to keep my comments short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| I do want to propose or bring out, emphasize a couple more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| First of all, as he says, you know, if you're looking at this plot of land, it looks ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| if you're looking for property next to a parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| But as the previous speaker spoke, this is not a flat piece of land that's necessarily easily developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6293)|
| 1:45:01| It is actually separated into the six separate partials that Wayne went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| divided north and south by the lake, divided east and west by Pellissippi and Emory Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| And there's constraints on either of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| And, again, it's not flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| Page five of your request is a train map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| And if you look at the actual numbers that the MPC staff has provided on page six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| it shows you that there is 31 acres that are either underwater or below the 820 flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6326)|
| 1:45:35| There's only 27 acres that are between zero and 15 percent in slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Over 42 acres have a slope of greater than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| And as Wayne said, seven entire acres have a slope 40 percent or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| That is, you know, if you look at a house roof with a pitch of 12, that's 45 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| So this is seven entire acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| And that's what we're maintaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| It is very challenging to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| Some of the concerns we have is in the request page two at the bottom, it says when you approve this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6365)|
| 1:46:14| you're approving 348 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| And we are equally concerned that this does not follow the hilltop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| The calculation at the bottom of the page by the MPC staff shows 172 acres if you apply those residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6383)|
| 1:46:32| And, you know, Wayne shared some of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| And, again, for those of you that were here last month, the conversation really reminded me of that scene from the Pirates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| of the Caribbean movie where the young lady was asking the pirate Balboa to honor the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| And the response that we got was, well, it's not really a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| It's more or less guidelines is what Captain Balboa said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| The minutes, if you look at those on page 49, were very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| If I may rebuke, these are not rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Those are kind of a framework for decision making that is advisory intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| What we're asking you to do is to honor the codes, as Wayne said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| and limit the number of houses to those that comply with the hilltop and ridge protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6436)|
| 1:47:24| Also, I'm concerned with the other provisions in that condition one of this request requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| that property be placed in a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| And it says it has in the plan that was approved by the MPC last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| It was approved by the MPC twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| They have confirmed that the plan does not provide any boundaries for this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| It provides no protection for this undisturbed land during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| It does require that it be defined before an occupancy permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| But I would like for you to make sure, Bob, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| putting into a condition that this property is defined before construction begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| so that these undisturbed lands will truly be undisturbed throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| We're also concerned in that the use on review provides for 2.96 acres of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6495)|
| 1:48:26| The location and use of this property has not been determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| or has not been specified in the submitted documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| This is specifically leery of the third residential lot on the west side apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| This one lot, which contains 1.4 acres, and this is my speculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| is strategically located just up from the marina that is forbidden to dispense gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| It is in proximity to 500 to 600 people that will have traffic challenges to get out to grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| It would be a very convenient location for a store with gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| In closing, my requests are for you to limit the number of dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| by requiring that they apply the Hilltop and Ridge Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| that you disallow the property west until it meets the conditions and the use on review condition 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6559)|
| 1:49:27| I said sanitary sewage service would be provided to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| There are no plans for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| I also ask you to look at the conditions and make sure that they are implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| before the bonuses associated with those conditions are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| Thank you very much for your time and this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Any questions of the speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| State your name and you have five minutes for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| My name is Bill Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| I do not live in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| I live in, actually, Commissioner Smith's area out in northern Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| But I've been asked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Mr. Waters, I'll need your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| I'm sorry, 6944 Mount Royal Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, in the Halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6610)|
| 1:50:18| I have been asked to speak on behalf of my good friends, Becky and Ed Sexton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| who are sitting here on the front row here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| And I can guarantee you I won't take the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| I probably won't take more than two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| I don't want to diminish anybody else's concern here because everybody has a big concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| about this property and certainly justifiably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| But a couple of weeks ago, Becky and Ed Sexton asked me to come down and talk to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| in just a few minutes about their particular concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| And their particular concern is, is the piece of property that you all are considering rezoning tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| completely surrounds their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| If you look on the nice little colored map that Wayne gave you a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| and you look at the small X that is actually the second X from the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| that is not the property that we anticipate rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| That is the Sexton property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| They have, in fact, lived here since the 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| Ed's grandfather developed the property, built the house there, had hundreds of other acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| And literally, if this rezoning is approved, this rezoning will surround their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6686)|
| 1:51:35| Now, not to mislead you, there is a conservation easement on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| So the apartments are on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| The apartments are proposed on the western side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| But they will have an apartment complex based on what they have provided us and presented us of approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6706)|
| 1:51:54| four stories that they claim will be within 150 to 300 feet of the property that ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6714)|
| 1:52:04| I'm sorry, I'm saying Ed and Becky Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| It's Ed and Becky Benson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| I represented a client by the name of Sexton earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Ed and Becky Benson, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I guess I ought to at least get your name right, shouldn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| But they are proposing an apartment complex of 328 apartments that are within 300 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| and perhaps as close as 150 feet to the Benson house that they have lived in for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| many, many years and the property that they have owned since the 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| In fact, as I looked at the property a week or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| it appears that if this apartment complex is built to the extent that it's proposed with four stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| literally Mr. and Mrs. Benson will not receive any of the sun at all from the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| Their home, which is a beautiful home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and as Wayne Klein alluded to earlier is worth a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| will literally be in the shadow of this entire apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| And that's not to say that the apartment complex won't, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| come closer to the Benson's because, in fact, they will have parking out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| There are proposed parking lots that come even closer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| So of all the folks here tonight that have an interest in this, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| and Mrs. Benson have a particular interest, not just in the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| not just in all the problems that Mr. Klein alluded to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| but literally they will be in the shadow of an apartment complex that will loom four stories above them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| I understand also from looking at that the apartment complex won't just be four stories above them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| but there's a grade there so it will actually be more than four stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| So Mr. and Mrs. Benson plead with you tonight and ask you respectfully to deny this rezoning petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6831)|
| 1:54:04| I believe there was another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6846)|
| 1:54:22| June Loy Whitaker, 819 Zola Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| I've got some notes, but I'm not using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Everything's been said, but I am just like the Benson's except I'm on the opposite side of the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6870)|
| 1:54:40| So when those four stories and the ten-foot things up there, they're going to be skyscrapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6880)|
| 1:54:48| and that's what I'm going to see day and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| The lights are going to bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| We'll have no darkness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| But my main thing that I want to say is my family moved there in the 1900s, and I know the property well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| I'm 79 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| Lived there since I was 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| And what Mr. Wayne said about the caves is what I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| Now, I don't know if you know about the creek that we call Ten Mile Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| but it begins at Walker Springs Road, travels down, comes under Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6920)|
| 1:55:32| comes under Ebenezer Road, travels about less than a mile, goes underneath Peters Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6932)|
| 1:55:42| Now, when the first utility district built the sewage treatment plant on Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6942)|
| 1:55:53| they dropped dye into Peters Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| And by the way, before it comes out where I live, it just drops into sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6959)|
| 1:56:07| It just goes no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| But then it reemerges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| But my point is about the dye being dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| And the gentleman come to our home for permission to go to check it out at the mouth of the cave where it reemerged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| It took four hours to come less than a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| So I know, and I've been in those caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| They're huge and they're large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| And the blasting, if there's any blasting, if it should just stop and block one of those caves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=6996)|
| 1:56:45| where's that water going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| You'll have a catastrophe on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Now, that's my point of view, except I am very disagreeable with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7009)|
| 1:56:57| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7018)|
| 1:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Scott Ashley, 946 Bream Drive in the Lakewood Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| But I'm speaking on behalf of West Emory Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| We're the church at the corner of Emory Church Road, from which it's named, and Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| And I'm here with our pastor, Mickey Vanderbilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| We are very concerned about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| We have, during the week, a daycare facility that has between 70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| and 80 students aged 18 months to fifth grade for the aftercare program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| We're concerned about the current level of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| In the morning, the existing traffic blocks our lower driveway that's closest to Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| and adding another 500, 600 cars in the morning is going to end up blocking our second entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| which is up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| We are in favor of development, as long as that development is within the county plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7085)|
| 1:58:13| and the southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Residential, that would be in keeping with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| But this density is too high for this size of road, which is a very narrow, steep road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| And we're worried about boats full of fuel traversing up and down in front of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| All right, if I've calculated correctly, if there's nobody else to speak, there's been 37 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| So you'll get 37 minutes, and then we'll go with the rebuttal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| and hopefully we'll keep those back down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| So, Mr. Hubert, name and address for the record, and your group will have 37 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| Thank you, John Huber, 213 Fox Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| First off, I'd like to thank you for your consideration of our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| As you know, I know you spent a tremendous amount of time listening to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| and I truly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| But you ask, you know, why are we requesting this type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| this low-density development on this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Simply put, because we're doing everything that the general plan says, the sector plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| the hillside and ridgetop protection plan, the zoning ordinance, the MPC staff, the MPC commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| and this body has directed us to do when we consider a new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| Here's a few reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| We need to, if we can get the monitor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Here's some of the reasons that we feel like you should support this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| We got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7182)|
| 1:59:51| Are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7191)|
| 2:00:09| Are we working on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| Is that the right board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7213)|
| 2:00:30| Sorry for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7230)|
| 2:00:45| Right now it's 6.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| What I think would be appropriate right now is to kind of take a break, try to get this equipment to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| So it's 6.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Let's reconvene up here, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| Commissioner, if you'll come back and grab your seats there, we'll kind of get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7257)|
| 2:01:07| It's 6.22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| You'll have 30 minutes to, in your plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| What was it, 37 or 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Thirty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| Thirty-five minutes to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7279)|
| 2:01:26| Can you try one of those first slides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7286)|
| 2:01:39| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| All right, we'll try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| Sorry for the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Well, first off, I mean, before I get going too far, I did want to let all the commissioners know that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| people in the area in West Knoxville that do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| And if the folks could also stand up that are in support of this project, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| I know you just sat back down when we got, but there's quite a bit in support of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| I'm just going to start over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| So first off, I'd like to thank you for your consideration of our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| I know you spent a tremendous amount of time listening to both sides, and I truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| But you asked, why are we requesting this type of development on this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| Simply put, because we're doing everything that the general plan, the sector plan, the hillside ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7351)|
| 2:02:38| the zoning ordinance, the MPC staff, MPC commissioners, Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| and Knox County Commission has asked us to do whenever we are planning a new development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| Here are some of the reasons why you should support this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Over the course of six months, as you see on the slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| we've made multiple attempts to communicate and compromise with area residents through two public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| multiple private meetings with the Whitakers and the Lois and all the folks that have been talking today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| as well as contacts with their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| We are respecting the spirit of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan that the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| the city council and county commission spent nearly three years and $400,000 of taxpayer money creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| As recommended in that plan, we're consolidating the allowable density to the flatter portions of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| and conserving nearly 25 acres of land around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| As you can see here in green, the preservation effort literally envelops the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| Our goal was to create an anti-sprawl, sustainable development in what is considered the fastest growing sector of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| The hillside and ridgetop protection plan is about developing what land we have left responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| In Westland Cove, as you can see here, we can house 56 families in the same land area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| that just 12 single-family homes occupy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| But in doing this, with this type of design, it enables us to conserve 50 percent of the land around the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| Another reason is that the property is zoned right in the heart of the planned growth area, not on the fringe of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| And it's only 2,500 feet off of a regional interstate system that carries over 50,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| Mr. Kline has mentioned the general plan and the sector plan in multiple Knox County zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| And this is where we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| The general plan recommends that planned development decisions should be based on an awareness of ever-changing character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| of the housing market and to allow higher densities in planned developments in exchange for deeper setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| and landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| We have buffers that are in landscape setbacks that are originally 35 feet per the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| and we're anywhere from 150 to 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| The general plan anticipated Westland Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| The real estate market is definitely changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| It is expected that nearly 300,000 people are going to move to our area by 2040,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| and nearly 100,000 of them are going to be renting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| Again, and we also really increased our buffers to lessen the impact on the adjoining landowners as we designed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7508)|
| 2:05:16| The southwest sector plan also anticipated Westland Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| Quoting the plan, in places, low-density land zone five units per acre has been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| with multifamily apartment uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| The overall density for these properties is still considered low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| We are requesting the same exact low-density five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| and multifamily use described in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| Again, as Mr. Klein stated, section 5.13 of the Knox County Zoning Regulation states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| each planned unit development shall be compatible with the surrounding or adjacent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| Such compatibility shall be determined by the planning commission by review of the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| After a thorough review of the Westland Cove plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| the MPC staff and the MPC commissioners have determined that this development is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| as evidenced by their vote of 14 to 1 in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| Our requested density is well within the range of what is around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| This slide illustrates the properties that are within a 1.5-mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| and already zone-planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| In this area, there are multiple apartment complexes with densities as high as 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| And we literally border a parcel that's five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| We are also offering Knox County Parks and Recreation the easements necessary to access 80 acres of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| inaccessible lakefront county-owned property with a new greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| When built, this greenway will enhance the community and be available to all Knox County residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| not just those of Westland Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| This project makes financial sense for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Before the first family moves in, we've committed to spend over $400,000 on improving a failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7616)|
| 2:07:01| Knox County intersection, and we're not requesting a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| Furthermore, over a 10-year period, this project has the potential to contribute over $3 million to the Knox County coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| This is recurring tax revenue, all with no public streets to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7632)|
| 2:07:20| It's estimated that through the construction of, the management of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| and the spending of the residents in Westland Cove, there will be a staggering 65-plus million dollars spent in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7643)|
| 2:07:30| in the course of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| In summary, this application is a reflection of the rules and regulations that this body has set forth for how it wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| Knox County to be developed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| We have followed every process and met or exceeded every requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| MPC has given the stamp of approval for the project with their 14-to-1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| They feel that this development is at the center of good, sustainable growth for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| I'd like to address a couple of things that have been discussed, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| Do you have, Jordan, do you have the buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| There's been, you know, a lot of talk about, you know, we're going to overshadow people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| We're going to put these high-rise buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| First off, they're not truly four-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| It's more accurately described as a three-story with a basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| There is four stories on one side, but there are three stories on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7706)|
| 2:08:34| Sorry, we're still having just a hair of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| This slide illustrates the buffer around it, but it does not show the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7719)|
| 2:08:49| This would go much smoother if we were sitting right next to each other, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| Benson, for example, who's been talking, we are -- our closest building is 170 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7738)|
| 2:09:05| where normally we would only have to be 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| Nathan, do you have the Benson cross-section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| I just wanted to roll into all those cross-sections if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| We spent a tremendous amount of time truly understanding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| We've gone through the grading plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| We know exactly where the steep spots are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| It's a challenging parcel, you know, but we've done so much research on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| spent so much money on trying to understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| and incorporating setbacks and buffers through the area in an attempt to make sure we have as little impact on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| What you're seeing now is a two-scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| I want to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| This is a two-scale version of Mr. Benson's home and our building, Building E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| which is what they're calling the four-story building, in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| As you can see here, there's a huge buffer of trees that we're leaving in between it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| as well as I think it's been exaggerated a little bit on how it's going to be in darkness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7801)|
| 2:10:09| I just am not sure that that would ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| But we've looked at everybody's like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| If you've got the other, we've looked at it coming across the cove as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7814)|
| 2:10:28| This is another cross-section we've taken, two-scale, which comes across from the Loy home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| and shows how we're trying to tuck the buildings in as much as possible on the flatter part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| but not at the top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| One of the biggest things is, I think, we're not defining the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| I mean, we are well below the ridge top, and we're staying down on the flatter portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| And, again, conserving up to 25 acres all the way around the property for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| I believe we've got one more that's for the Ford home that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7856)|
| 2:11:14| This is another example of how we've tried to keep tremendous buffers next to the neighbors with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7874)|
| 2:11:22| you know, with respect to our development by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| This is not something that we were forced to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| This was all by design in the very beginning as we were contemplating the Westland Cove project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7888)|
| 2:11:37| That's all I had for this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| But I know that the mail guards are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| and they wanted to address the commission through their attorney, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| as well as we actually have someone who would like to speak who is from the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| It's your 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7913)|
| 2:12:01| Alexander Waters, 1111 North Shore Drive, suite S700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| We represent the Melgard family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| And as Mr. Hubert has already told you all tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| a representative from the Melgard family is joining us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| If you could please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| This is Mr. David Melgard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| And Mr. Melgard, along with his family, have compiled a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| And I may have the easiest job tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| I get to just read you a letter from the Melgard families, and this is their position in their own words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| If you would like a copy of this, Mr. King is putting it into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| and I also have copies if you'd like to have one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| This property has been in the Melgard family since 1901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| Five generations of the family have lived in the land and initially farmed the land for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| Subsequent family members lived in the land and maintained the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| while other family and friends visited and vacationed on the land over the past 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| However, we have lost so many members of our family that have lived on and cared for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| And this has particularly been true over the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| The smaller group of heirs and our generation of elder family heirs are sadly gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7988)|
| 2:13:14| Due to these losses, it has become very difficult to meet the financial obligations related to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| These obligations include, but are not limited to, Knox County taxes, maintenance, insurance, fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| and general oversight of the property, and that's just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| This is evidenced by the fact that our property has become overgrown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| and we have not been able to protect the property from vandalism, theft, trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| and illegal dumping from people living in the surrounding area, despite our best efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| There's not a week that goes by that someone does not dump a load of trash or a used appliance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| and those of you dealing with similar problems may be able to relate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| We've tried to protect our property and have never tried to sell any portion of it until now, as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8035)|
| 2:14:03| Over the years, we have lost portions of our property through condemnation by TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| through various water line and sewer line easements to the utility companies to keep up with the explosive growth of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| and to provide those services to the very subdivisions and neighbors who are now fighting us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| and also through eminent domain, as 20 percent of the property was taken by the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8057)|
| 2:14:25| 20 years ago for the construction of Interstate 140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| Prior to the interstate, the character of the area had already started to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| with the subdividing of old, large, nearby family farms, and the creation of smaller lot subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| like Tonrara and Woodland Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| Once the interstate and the off-ramps were finished 20 years ago, construction took off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| and Westland Drive, Fox Road, and Emory Church Road were changed forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| This fact is evident if one examines the changes in land use within just a three-mile proximity of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| Unfortunately, due to these factors, the family has had to make the very difficult decision to sell our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8102)|
| 2:15:09| The property has been on the market for close to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| and we have had only one interested group that is willing to work with the challenges it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| and to purchase the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| The potential buyers have put an enormous amount of time, effort, and capital to create options that consider preserving green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8121)|
| 2:15:30| and protect parts of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Today, we ask our neighbors and area residents to understand our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| and respect our families' needs and rights to sell our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| We urge the community to work with Mr. Huber's group to find common ground and compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| in making this area a beautiful place for new generations of families to live and enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| much as you enjoy your property that was built on land formerly owned by the families that came before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| Thank you, the Malgaard family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8160)|
| 2:16:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| My name is Buddy Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| I live at 715 Lago Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| That's in Tanner Air Subdivision off Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| I see a lot of friends and neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| And I am sorry that we have to be on opposite sides of varying opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| I do see some friends here that are in support of this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| First of all, I'd like to remind the commission, as Mr. King and Mr. Huber have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| that this is responsible zoning as defined by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| A professional staff reviewed the application with regard to the hillside development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| which Mr. Norman fought for for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| and other zoning guidelines that they have to go by and deemed it appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| A citizen group of 14 or 15 Metropolitan Planning Commissioners voted for this plan, 14 to 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8214)|
| 2:17:04| citizens like yourself that are unpaid volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| It's a responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| They are developing a small portion of the larger tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8229)|
| 2:17:16| The adjacent properties are United States Interstate 140, an athletic field, a church, the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8236)|
| 2:17:22| It's not abutting a single-family residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| The impact to our schools will be nominal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| The Metropolitan Planning Commission projects about 50 kids will be going to three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| That's over 13 grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| I suspect many of those will be privately schooled or homeschooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| So that's four kids per grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| The large buffers will be left in place forever, forever with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| There will be significant contributions to the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| I know the church is concerned about the traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| That's not going away without the improvements that this development will bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| I've heard a lot of people discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| and be concerned about the depth of the cove, runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| There are a plethora of state and federal agencies that will closely monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| and regulate the development of marinas, runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| and everything else that's involved to procure a development building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| marina permit, for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| So I've spoken with most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| I know many of you personally, and I appreciate your support of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8304)|
| 2:18:40| How much time do we have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| I'm not going to take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| About 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| That ought to be more than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8329)|
| 2:19:01| The traffic study that was done was done at the request of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| and county engineering was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| The area that was sort of the focus area for this traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8351)|
| 2:19:19| basically, was the intersection of Emory Church Road and Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| The desired and, if you will, required improvements there include widening Emory Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8365)|
| 2:19:34| adding lanes to facilitate right and left turning traffic on Emory Church onto Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8374)|
| 2:19:44| The improvements on Westland will include, again, widening of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| and the addition of a turn lane to facilitate traffic turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| onto Emory Church Road off of Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| All that work is done, if you will, in coordination with or as an adjunct to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| perhaps would be a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| improvements in the area by the Tennessee Department of Transportation at the Westland I-140 interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8409)|
| 2:20:19| again, with the addition of lanes to facilitate traffic getting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| and on from Westland onto either side, either direction, if you will, of I-140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8424)|
| 2:20:33| That will, in their belief and experience, will improve traffic conditions at that particular interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8433)|
| 2:20:43| or, if you will, intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Additionally, the state is going to be doing work at the I-140 Kingston Pike interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8447)|
| 2:20:56| again, adding lanes to facilitate traffic getting off I-140, making turns onto Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8456)|
| 2:21:07| The result of all of that is an improved condition for traffic that can be improved at that particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8467)|
| 2:21:20| and at the location for Emory Church and Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| It is not our development that requires all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| There were problems there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| And when we go there and these corrections or improvements are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8494)|
| 2:21:42| we're the ones that are bearing the financial brunt of that and the cost of doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8502)|
| 2:21:51| It's going to exceed $400,000 by the current county estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| Black's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| And if I'm getting that wrong, he can come down here and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| It is also true, and we have been told more than once, that without this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8526)|
| 2:22:14| there will be no improvements to Emory Church Road or to Westland that involve our part of the improvements of widening it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8534)|
| 2:22:25| that the crash count numbers and other factors looked at and considered by county engineering do not warrant putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8545)|
| 2:22:37| project up for any improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| And this is an opportunity to have someone who is, as a private development, investing money in public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8561)|
| 2:22:54| And without that, there won't be any of the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| I wanted to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| And I know that Ms. Pianchi spoke at quite some length at the Metropolitan Planning Commission Agenda Review Session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8581)|
| 2:23:10| about the information with regard to this road as compared to other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8590)|
| 2:23:17| And reiterating, restating, if you will, the same view that absent this, that this will not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8597)|
| 2:23:29| As to the statement about this development being inappropriate and then the word was thrown in and illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8609)|
| 2:23:41| I'm going to express a different view and opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| Having spent the number of years I've spent doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| I do not believe there's anything in this request that's before you tonight that is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| And you can call on your own counsel in that regard, but the use of property owned by the same owner to count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8638)|
| 2:24:10| if you will, on the density that is permitted is, in the history of zoning in Knox County, a regular occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8650)|
| 2:24:26| There's no way to truly say that this land that they want to talk about that's on the west side is undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| It can be developed a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Some people would develop it one way, some another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| But, you know, to stand and sort of boldly say, because TVA gave some land to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8682)|
| 2:24:52| that we can't permit or give the county access to it through coordinating a greenway trail is just not an accurate statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8692)|
| 2:25:05| or position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I know that there's been, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| expression of dissatisfaction to the point of challenging, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8712)|
| 2:25:21| the procedures and utilization of information by the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8721)|
| 2:25:34| Once again, I've worked with them and been involved with them over a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| I believe they've looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| I believe I understand their calculations and the basis upon which they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| And I think perhaps you might want to hear from Mr. Donaldson in that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8747)|
| 2:25:56| I would observe that it's rather straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| We're observing the hillside and hilltop regulations by not building on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8760)|
| 2:26:11| It is rather straightforward that we have roughly 67 acres that is above the 820 contour that is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8771)|
| 2:26:23| And if you say, as we requested, five units to the acre for the amount of acreage that's above the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8783)|
| 2:26:32| and that which was not being utilized for a marina, you take that number of acres, multiply it by five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8792)|
| 2:26:41| and that's the permitted density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| You can look at some other ways of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| You can talk about if you wanted to build on hillsides how many units per acre you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8808)|
| 2:26:56| You can get some bonus property by observing the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| by having a public process of letting the public utilization of some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8821)|
| 2:27:09| You get a bonus, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| It gives you another count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| Mr. Donaldson and MPC staff, I think, stated and articulated rather clearly what it was that they were primarily looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8834)|
| 2:27:22| in connection with their recommendation on this particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| And we would ask that you all uphold that process he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8846)|
| 2:27:36| He wants to bend it one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| I'm going to try to look at it straight on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| The newspaper, if you will, endorsed the concept of process and following the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8862)|
| 2:27:52| And here you have somebody that worked from the start to be in compliance with the general plan, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8872)|
| 2:28:00| the hilltop regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| He's involved himself in investment in public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| He hasn't asked for any government funding or give me program whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| And he has done everything he's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| If you go through all of that and you tell somebody in spite of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| and in spite of the recommendation of the professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8905)|
| 2:28:29| and in spite of the approval by the Metropolitan Planning Commission itself, you can't build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8909)|
| 2:28:37| And I don't believe I fully understand how you can talk about building much of anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8917)|
| 2:28:46| Do the residents want apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| The answer is clearly no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| And they have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| But this is going to be a Class A, high-end, market-rate apartment dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8934)|
| 2:29:02| And there is tremendous demand for that kind of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| Once again, we would ask that you approve the recommendation of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| and vote in favor of rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| There's a few minutes left, Mr. Hubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| Do you have anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| What I'd like to do with the commission, I think we need to we need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8964)|
| 2:29:32| And what I'd like to do is have the commission discussion and to ask the questions and answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| Each side a five- or ten-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| I think that would be appropriate if that's all right with the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| I'll make a motion to approve to get it on the table so we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| I'd like to have any commissioner that would like to ask any questions, have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| hear from Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| I got portions of the minutes from last month's MPC meeting, and I passed out to all of you all today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9016)|
| 2:30:24| some of the comments that were used in which Mr. Kline has gone over pretty much in depth earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9024)|
| 2:30:32| The issue to me is that we're slippery sloping on the edge of setting a precedent here that will remain forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9032)|
| 2:30:45| They can come along and say that the Hillside Ridgetop Plan was advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9045)|
| 2:30:53| Mr. Donaldson uses a theory or the phrase in theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| He's got a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| This was his idea brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| It's come from Planet ET, and that's also from Agenda 21 where they want to move everybody out of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| into the city, stack them in 50-story buildings, and return all your farms back to nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9069)|
| 2:31:16| That's the bottom line of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| There are places where apartments are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| I do not agree with his assessment, the fact that they should be at every single major interchange of a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9083)|
| 2:31:35| There's a lot of non-ruled decisions coming down from that office that they seem to sway whatever seems to fit them at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9095)|
| 2:31:51| This is not proper planning, and I don't think that we, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| can approve anything that's not been vetted out and approved by this body as a general rule for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9117)|
| 2:32:07| And, in essence, that's what they're asking us to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| When you look at the development units, that's the big diversion between the two groups right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9131)|
| 2:32:19| If you have a 20-acre piece of property, 10 acres down here is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9139)|
| 2:32:27| The next five is up to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| The next five is 25 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| Legally, you can develop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| You can develop it down here at five to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| You can develop this second section at two to the acre, not five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| because that's what's under the hillside slope protection agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| And this third section up here, you can only develop at a half a unit per acre, not five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9167)|
| 2:32:53| So, if you don't have that ability to develop these up here, how can you transfer them down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| when you're transferring something you don't own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| It just don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| That dog don't howl, as my granddaddy used to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| We talked about the road improvements out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| We're talking about, and I grant that that does need some work, but we're talking about one intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| We're talking about putting in some turn lanes and a red light or some backup lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9194)|
| 2:33:20| But it hasn't been mentioned the fact that the state and feds have on the board plans already for, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9200)|
| 2:33:29| there's either three or four red lights at that interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| which is going to mitigate some of this traffic heading this particular direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| Actually, in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| But that wasn't mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| I mentioned the 14-to-1 vote at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| And somebody who was there at the MPC told me that one commissioner says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| well, let's just pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| We can't agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| Let's just pass it on to the county commission and let them settle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| That's not a way for a county or a metropolitan planning commission to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| They're supposed to be the ones who look into these things, know the rules on rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| and they're supposed to be the ones to recommend to us things that should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9247)|
| 2:34:14| I disagree with the fact that they say that all of this new traffic from this development is going to exit out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| Westland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| If you're living in that spot right in that corner where that is right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| and you wanted to go to Turkey Creek, how would you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| You would not come back out to the interstate and get on it and go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| No, you're going to go straight out Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| The traffic problems in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| and we went through this once before when we had another development that was supposed to go there right on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9278)|
| 2:34:46| And we turned it down because of it, mainly because of the traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| That road, Fox Road right there, you barely can pass on two bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| I don't know how they get semis through there or drink trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| And I know one guy made the comment that he's pulled several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| He lives at the corner where he pulled several of them out of his yard because they don't make that turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| We're not doing anything to mitigate that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| That's still going to be there, plus an additional 2,928 road trips a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| of which at least half of those are going to go that direction because they want to go to Turkey Creek or someplace that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9318)|
| 2:35:25| Ecclesiastes said there's a time and a place for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| This is not the place for this magnitude of a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| We haven't talked about the marina, and we haven't talked about the boat storage and all of that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9337)|
| 2:35:42| You're looking at a pool there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| If you had a boat there, and we're just barely in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| When I saw it, we're still in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| It's already mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| How can you run a boat in the mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| If it's five months a year in the mud, why would I want to dock my boat there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| particularly when you've got half a mile down the road, you've got one marina that is less than 50% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9359)|
| 2:36:06| Another half a mile on down, you've got another marina that's 50% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| So why spend, you know, why blow money to put another one in when you don't have any water to float your boat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9370)|
| 2:36:19| It just don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| But my big, again, my big problem is with some of the processes that's being spoon-fed down to the MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9384)|
| 2:36:33| on some of these theories and whimsies that are not what we voted on in some of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| And that disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| If we're going to have some hillside ridgetop development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| and transfer developments, then we need to set some parameters for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| And that's essentially what we're looking at here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| We need to set some parameters on how this will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| It's not going to be done haphazardly where the market flips a coin and says, okay, it's five today and ten tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| Folks, we need to take a serious look at this before you make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9426)|
| 2:37:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| Mr. King, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| About the marina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Something pulled you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Yeah, I can respond now and probably sort of keep things in the same subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| Two points I would simply make, and I don't mean to be argumentative about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| but Commissioner Brown's statement doesn't know how he can get two bicyclists to pass on the roads out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9452)|
| 2:37:38| Ms. Bianchi is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| I believe if called here, I can say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| I believe she would back me up if she called upon to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| Every road out there meets county minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| Every road out there meets county minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| Now, does that mean they're wide enough in somebody's view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| But they all meet county minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| Talking about what MPC staff looks at and considers in making recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9485)|
| 2:38:12| and that this body is supposed to be involved somehow in dictating to them what they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| They routinely make recommendations that involve an analysis of AASHTO standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9500)|
| 2:38:29| Y'all probably don't even necessarily know what that is, but that's something that you all didn't vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9509)|
| 2:38:35| They refer to national standards about certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| The fact that they talk about a several-county, three-year course of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9520)|
| 2:38:47| as to how development should be done in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| and where certain things ought to be, you know, not pushed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| but certain things ought to be considered for certain areas and certain dynamics that exist there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9537)|
| 2:39:03| it is certainly not uncommon, and it's done virtually all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9543)|
| 2:39:10| I have a sense, perhaps, that Commissioner Brown is of the view that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9550)|
| 2:39:17| some of our other metropolitan planning commissions out here are running amok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| I can assure you, sir, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| They've got plenty of background for what it is they suggest and recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| Not last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Mr. Ted, audience, audience, audience, we're not going to get into a back-and-forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| We've had a great discussion for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| Let's keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9580)|
| 2:39:41| Just real quick, Cindy, can you come down here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| And, John, I'm going to ask you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9583)|
| 2:39:51| Cindy, if you'll just tell the audience here what your title is and what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| Cindy Pianki, Director of Planning and Development for Knox County's Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| and Public Works, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| In your opinion of this project, this development, is this something that's doable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| I know he's going to do some things, but in your opinion, are you satisfied with what you have seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9615)|
| 2:40:16| In regards to the MPC staff report, there were four conditions related to traffic-specific situations in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9616)|
| 2:40:25| what improvements needed to be made at what points in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9625)|
| 2:40:29| And I actually helped craft those comments in the staff report for MPC to make sure that they got them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9629)|
| 2:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| And, audience, these are our professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| I just want to say just real quick, thank you, Cindy, real quick, and probably speak, I hope, on behalf of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| commissioners here, we received hundreds of e-mails, phone calls, and letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9647)|
| 2:40:54| Probably one of the best organized group efforts I've seen in my seven and a half years being on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| I mean, I applaud both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| It was very professionally done on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| We could not get back, or I couldn't personally get back to every e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9665)|
| 2:41:10| I tried to get to the ones I could and phone calls take, but read all those and the letters and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9670)|
| 2:41:16| But it did not go unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| Mr. Hubbard, if you'll come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9679)|
| 2:41:26| Some of the things that I'm looking at and that I've seen from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| I think what you've tried to project is first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| You've met with me individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| Tell us, again, if you went with the homes, how much space would be left versus going to the apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9699)|
| 2:41:47| How much buffer zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| Well, I did not see that in your display up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9713)|
| 2:41:54| To the truth be known, we originally looked at it as a single family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| But we learned quickly that it would effectively have to be a clear cut and a massive dirt mission to get the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9720)|
| 2:42:09| where it needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| It does have slope issues, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| so we decided it would be much, much better environmentally as well as market-wise to consolidate that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9732)|
| 2:42:19| and respect the hillside ridgetop and protect everything around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9739)|
| 2:42:24| You know, when you showed me that map of the houses versus the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| and the buffer zone that you gave the neighbors, I'm telling neighbors that was so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| That would have been a better option down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| Your community meetings, very first class done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| They were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| The DVDs that we got from both sides, very, very first class done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9760)|
| 2:42:49| I was impressed tonight with your diagrams that you showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| You've taken a lot of time and you've put a lot of effort into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| showing you take somebody else's rooftop, you take your rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| and seeing how much sun is going to be blocked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| I mean, it shows you're conscientious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| And I think I heard, I hope it's true, I think I've heard that you're an award-winning developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| Is this true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| We have won NPC of the year, subdivisions of the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| You know, I'm hoping if this passes and you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| I hope that maybe you would receive another award for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| Because I think when it's all said and done, it will be first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| And I wish you good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| In reply to a couple of things that Mr. King said a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| I realize the fact that I've known John Huber for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| I know he does good developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| We just happen to disagree on particularly the density on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| But there comes a time and a place where you have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9836)|
| 2:44:04| It's hard in zoning to have a cut and dried black and white rule for every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9844)|
| 2:44:13| There has to be some gray, but you have to judiciously use that gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| But what I'm saying is we're going to have to get something down on paper that we can live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9858)|
| 2:44:25| that the developers know what they can do, deal with, and what we expect out of NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9865)|
| 2:44:32| They're supposed to be the experts, but I don't feel like we've been led down the right road in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| John mentioned the fact that those roads out there meet the minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| Yeah, for probably 1960, the last time they were upgraded maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| But you put 3,000 more vehicles on this road every day, suddenly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9893)|
| 2:45:00| you can only put so much crap in a five-pound bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| You can't put so many cars on the road, suddenly it's going to be wall-to-wall cars, nothing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9904)|
| 2:45:13| Nobody's moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| And another thing about the marinas, too, I mentioned a little while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| when we're talking 300 apartments, how many apartment owners out here are going to be the boat owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| They're not going to be boat owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| That's why I suggested to Mr. Huber that he nix that idea and come back with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| But he says it's on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| He wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| But, anyway, I would encourage you all to think very seriously about what you're voting on in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| Commissioner, is there a lot on the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| Okay, I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| Yes, sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| No, it's kind of hidden here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9947)|
| 2:45:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| I guess, you know, the big thing I kind of want to deal with in my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| and then I do have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| I actually went to a seminar talk at a conference about generational differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| And I think it's key here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| You know, the thinking of the greatest generation is not the thinking of the baby boomers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9973)|
| 2:46:18| not the thinking of Generation X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| definitely not the thinking of Generation Y, the folks born after, say, 1980 or whatever year that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9980)|
| 2:46:26| And what I think we have to get our arms around is a statement that we just probably had some disagreement on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| is will an apartment owner own a boat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9993)|
| 2:46:37| These 20-somethings don't think like we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=9997)|
| 2:46:42| And so, you know, I can't look at, you know, would I want to live in an apartment my whole life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| I want property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| I want land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10009)|
| 2:46:50| That's the way we think and frame things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| You know, as more and more folks move into this region from other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| they're not as, you know, enchanted with my square, you know, acre or two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10016)|
| 2:47:04| So I think that has to play into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| You know, just the fact that apartment complexes are terrible, they're going to bring property values down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10027)|
| 2:47:12| You can't make that wide sweeping statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| And that's on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| You really can't do that because you're looking at it with today's thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10037)|
| 2:47:21| It did it ten years ago at this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| You know, and I just think that we kind of have to expand our vision a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10044)|
| 2:47:31| You know, one of the things that bothers me, and then I'll ask my question, is this whole notion of if we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10051)|
| 2:47:38| we talked about this slope, rich protection, and nausea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10058)|
| 2:47:45| And we got the Briggs Amendment, and it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| I didn't vote for it, but it did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| But we always said this is still a document that MPC will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| Now we're trying to slap their hands because they're using the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| I mean, regardless of this vote, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| We created this document for them to use, not as a law, not as a you have to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10085)|
| 2:48:13| But we said that everyone, even the folks voting for the amendment, said, okay, this is still a good body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10093)|
| 2:48:20| They'll use it, and we'll decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| But just to say, oh, they invoked the plan, we have to throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10103)|
| 2:48:30| No, it has to be a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| You have to give them tools to manage with or manage by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| So that bothers me as well because, again, it's a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| It would have been a better document, you know, from my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10121)|
| 2:48:45| But still, it's a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| I think everyone said that during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| We just didn't want to limit property rights, property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| And, you know, now it sounds like that's what we're trying to do with these particular property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| And so that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| And then, you know, the whole notion of Plan E.T. being connected with this mysterious Agenda 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| where I've never met anyone from this Agenda 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| I don't know where they live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| Maybe they drive the black helicopters that surround us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| That we've got to get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| Let's talk about the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| The conversation I read here was talking about what regions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| We have to collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| We've gotten to this with the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| We're not in a box in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| They have to talk to adjacent counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| You know, the ridges and the slopes don't magically stop at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| So we have to talk to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| We have to do some type of regional thinking about how we're going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10183)|
| 2:49:49| The borders, I mean, our borders, our lawmaking abilities stop at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10189)|
| 2:49:54| But from a planning standpoint, we can't stop there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10194)|
| 2:49:59| So, again, just trying to frame the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| Let's not get into this NPC is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| I mean, they've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10207)|
| 2:50:08| They do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| So I don't like their votes, so they're certainly bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10210)|
| 2:50:13| I don't want to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| I don't want to become adversarial with the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| They've vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| 14-1 is 14-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| Okay, you can make some off comment, but a vote is a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| We trust the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| We've trusted the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| We can disagree with the body, but we've trusted the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| So now we're getting into this, you know, adversarial thing, and I really don't want to start that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10230)|
