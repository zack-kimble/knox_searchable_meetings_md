| 0:17:15| So we are basically just switching the LLC under which the operation is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| Everything else is in place, owners and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| So how much time do you think you need to make all your transactions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I think we're still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1056)|

| 0:17:44| Well, yeah, health inspections are building and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| None of them have contacted me, but then also the sales tax registration for the new LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| the articles for the new LLC, and then ultimately, you know, surrender of that existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Okay, I think Kevin signed off today, so we still need those other ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| but should be able to do that within a month's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Okay, so 60 days' work, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Well, 30 should suffice, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| If you're going to make a motion for 90 days, you can always come pick it up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1099)|

| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| And your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| And can you speak a little bit closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| 5,000 Clinton Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1184)|

| 0:19:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| So we have had some difficulties with contractors coming out because it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| center unit of a strip mall, and the strip mall was sold from one person to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| another to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| So there's just been a lot of paperwork and contracting delays in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| However, we think that we're going to be able to open the doors in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Would you like a little bit longer than that, maybe 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I'll take 60 for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1219)|

| 0:20:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I'm really hoping for 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| It's been a little too long already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| I'll give you a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| So I'll make a motion to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1234)|

| 0:21:06| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| We're almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| We corresponded with the building inspector, and I think we talked as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| We're right at the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| So we are resubmitting some drawings, and we've already spoken with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| so we're hoping that that's a knockout and we'll be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| So 60 days, 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I mean, 90 is probably better, but I'm hoping that we'll be done sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days so you can pick it up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1297)|

| 0:21:58| Mr. Bird, were you able to speak with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| I haven't spoken with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| I sent a reminder email to both owners today, but I didn't get a reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| I know they have been waiting on one owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| We deferred them a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| but I don't know if they somehow thought that was an automatic case that they'd be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| I don't know what the thought process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1346)|

| 0:22:29| Well, I just wanted to point out for everybody that we gave them a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| postponement in January and in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| so now it would be March if we do another one, be the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I think, you know, that's what I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| If there is confusion on their part, the one owner had not completed his background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-292-230321?start=1364)|
