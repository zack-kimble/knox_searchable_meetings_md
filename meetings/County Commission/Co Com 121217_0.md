| 0:06:12| before you more than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| suspension currently then is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| that we have a location with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| invalid permit. And at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| point in time the only option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| since they've not provided for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| valid permit would be suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| of the current permit. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=387)|

| 0:08:06| in abstentia. There is no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| to plead guilty or not guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| or otherwise. The last stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| meeting when the representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| was here that question came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| my mind but it got away from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| before I could delve into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| There was no plea put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| record but the stated facts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| where they are and it's up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| this body. You can deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| and determine whether you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| to try them in abstentia find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| them in abstentia. But there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| no one to pay and there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| license to hold it against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Well I like kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| citing someone for speeding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| a car and they're no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| here and there's no longer a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| valid license and there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| longer a valid driver. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Due to the history that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| had with this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| location as Mr. May testified a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| moment ago the first time we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| kind of let them off with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| slap on the wrist with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| promise of remedial procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| which never did get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Which never did get put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| place. But the one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| he mentioned to me and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| didn't testify to it up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| while ago but I'm sure that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| would is the fact that matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| of fact I believe he did last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| month on one of these that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| first girl that went in to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| the clerk told her to hold her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| license up so it looked like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| she was reading it. The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| time the young buyer was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| well I know you're underage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| I'm probably police are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| get me for this one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| days. But she sold her anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| So to me this just demonstrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| a lack of oversight of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| or what have you. I mean they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| go take these courses but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| just like any manager in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| business. If you don't watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| after your employees they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| going to do what they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| away with. Maybe that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| girls were friend of the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| I don't know. But juvenile court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| has also had numerous complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| about teenagers being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| buy beer at this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| location. So based on that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| don't know about the fine. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| was kind of like you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| the barn door after the horses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| escaped. But I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| this license be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Okay Mr. Wright. I'll make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| motion. Okay. That's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| substitute motion. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| making a motion to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| suspended have license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| suspended. Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Second. Okay. We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Go ahead Mr. Wright. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Mr. Chairman. I'm not speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| to the substitute motion. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| asking a question as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| to me not being a lawyer. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| Law Director. My limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| understanding of and let me use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| another let me use a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| circumstance as if I have power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| of attorney on my mom who is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| the hospital right now. Hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| you're doing well mom. But I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| not have power of attorney for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| my mother. But if I hold power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| of attorney on another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| individual that expires when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| that person passes. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| correct. Does this license pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| when this person. It's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| really I'm giving you an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| under the prior violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Right now this the racetrack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| number six seven five nine does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| not have a license. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| invalid. It's gone. So you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| could know what I was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| earlier. The worst thing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| could do if you wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| an action on these charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Well the worst thing you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| do would be revoke it and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| would put a year's moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| on any beer sales at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| premises. But the other the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| other side of that coin is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| if we take no action it is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| invalid today also. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| correct. No more beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Really upon time of death. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| beer sales from the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Mr. Henry's died are under an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| invalid license. And that's by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| law not by our action. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| right. I'll not be supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| the substitute motion. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| prefer the beer board not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| take action and the that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| be a declaration that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| no license at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| That'd be satisfactory to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| a motion on that. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| motion substitute motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| floor. Question. Yes. I may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| want to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Since he has been selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| illegally since his father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| passed can he be fined for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| that under the law. Yeah. If he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| were caught in the act cited in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| the act to me like have you been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| speeding in the streets since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| you know what your license were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| taken. Yeah. But they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| to be evidence prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| presented just as any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| case. Well he just gave us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| evidence. He said he was he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| not a he's not a license holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| and I don't know where the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| has jurisdiction over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| non-license holder. Wolfie could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| go side a premises but it'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| to be the owner and who's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| owner of this operation now. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I said after my father's death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| just a couple of weeks ago we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| just trying to figure out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| we're going to do as a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| OK. Did you. May I. Yes. May I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| address something that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| heard twice here as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| remedial procedure violation. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| had sent a letter and wrote a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| letter about the procedures that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| we undertook to improve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| prevent and take preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| measures in in preventing future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| violations. Also before I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| before I had to leave when my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| father was on life support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| before the previous yearboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| hearing I put together a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| and a package and tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| elaborate not only the remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| procedures from the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| violation that are in place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| also additional things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| we're doing and I have each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| one of my employees sign a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| responsibility pledge. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| this incident and this is after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| the fact was an incident of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| one particular lady who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| certain circumventing all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| systems and that we put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| to prevent this. She was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| She is not a reflection of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| way we do things there and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I'm saddened. I take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| responsibility for it. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| are very very you know we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| this very seriously and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| we're we're we like to be on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| right side of the law. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| after my father's death I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| there was a beer board hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| coming. I did not know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| intricacies of the law. I I we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| were just you know dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| that matter and I knew I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| appear here and I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| would be addressed. So I was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| doing anything you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| deliberately that violated law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| because I didn't know what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| happen which is a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| we're learning for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| time. So I hope that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| And we are you know law abiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| business people. We try to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| the best we can. This was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| incident of my poor judgment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| hiring a lady that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| following the systems we had in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| place. And I've elaborated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| that letter all the systems that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| are there. And I had emailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| that letter to each one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| respectable commissioners. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| not sure if you had time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| review that but I was I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| hope that that would make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| clear in this about how we run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| our business and how we are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| general. Did you not testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| just a minute ago that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| personally held a beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| before? Yes. And in getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| beer license you were asked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| series of questions were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| not? Yes. Okay. And one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| questions were are you familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| with the Knox County Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| beer laws and the regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| And do you agree to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| your business in conformity with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| them? Yes. And you were under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| oath when you made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| statement? Yes. Thank you. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| Mr. Hammond. I do have a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| your letter and I have a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| the signed statements the Raceway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Responsibility Pledge have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| reviewed it. I guess I have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| or three questions. Question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| number one is the fact that his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| father is deceased and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| that there is no license holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| he needs to cease selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| immediately. And there's I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| that's that's just the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| is. That's the way it is. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| you'll need to cease that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| immediately. I'm not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| interested in piling on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| This is just me personally. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| he has admitted that that it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| wrong but frankly I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| the beer board now for eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| years. I've never had anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| come in and have their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| sign a pledge like this. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| this is a step in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| direction. So what are his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| options now? He will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| stop selling beer immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Will he need to reapply and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| we'll have to come back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| us et cetera et cetera. So is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| that the procedure? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| correct. The premises right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| is not licensed to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| If that premises desires to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| it also depends you know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| the whether he has a will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| whether it's an intestate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| situation who owns the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| who gets the business someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| whoever that is decided to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| will have to come and apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| a beer license and on the norm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| just like you or I would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| through the procedure and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| this body decides to grant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| then it is and if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| they don't. That's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| where he is right now. Well my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| sense is is that this gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| realizes the severity of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| has happened. I think he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| trying to rectify it and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| sense that and maybe I'm maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| I'm misreading it but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| believe that he is wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| to correct the situation. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| legally he has to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| immediately selling beer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| can't sell it anymore until he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| comes back before us. So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| is the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Motion is to suspend. Yes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I mean it's automatic anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| So I'll I'll I'll be in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| of doing that because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| what we have to do. But then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| you can go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| of reapplying and coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| before us. Okay. Thank you. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I would Mr. Sadiq I'd like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| want to speak in favor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| sympathy of your situation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| you're in. And also I was I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| very impressed with your letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| and your procedures. And based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| on that letter I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| have a discussion with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| director possibly after we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| decide this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Specifically your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| that there's a disclosure form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| for each person that they sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| off on as to the current the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| potential criminal consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| and fines etc. associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| an activity like the your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| employee. I think that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| wonderful thing to do. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| think that it might serve us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| stop some of the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| you are trying to do. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| you've got to run a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| and there's no way for you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| ferret out every ne'er do well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| in the world when you're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| to hire people. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| maybe that would help. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| going to ask the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| to investigate that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| addition to our permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| process. And I thought that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| a very good suggestion. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| scare them enough on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| end then maybe they won't they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| won't do this type of thing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| it'll help you know it'll help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| somewhat. So I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| And my question also to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| director now though is how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| in best case scenario how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| would it be. Do we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| idea how long it would be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Mr. Siddique to to to gain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| new beer permit. He would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| I would probably say be 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| or better. He just has to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| through the process filling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| the application paying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| normal fee have the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| investigations done by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| health department codes sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| etc. come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| on the next month's hearing if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| approved then he's good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| OK. Mr. McKenzie. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| sir. You know I'm I'm I'm I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| like Commissioner Hammond and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| that you know and I was I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| not not happy with with with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| previous process in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| the multiple hits. But I too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| was impressed by the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| And you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| You did write a after we asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| you to write a plan. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| remember seeing that that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| so you or your your family did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| write that at the earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| offense. I guess in terms of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| question I'm I'm again going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| with Commissioner Wright in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| this one and I may remove my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| second after this answer. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| know I hear questions I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| heard in my time here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| commission. Have you ever had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| a license revoked. So I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| that's a key question. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| if has this entity or has this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| establishment ever had a revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| license. So that's making me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| think that you know just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| ease of getting back up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| business would it be better for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| us to take no action. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| next month if he gets his ducks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| in a row he can he can have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| new application. So that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| question. That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Yeah. In terms of facilitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| him to be able to get a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| permit the no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| alternative would be the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| for in his interest a revoke of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| this current license would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| terminal for a year for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| establishment. So I'm and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| heirs of that establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Yes. So I'm going to I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| to pull my second on that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| second Commissioner Brown's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| motion. I'm going to I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| OK. Mr. Brown Jeff something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| else. OK. I do. I will withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| that motion but I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| point this out. You know we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| got that packet of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| and the letters and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| employees sign but those same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| employees also took that course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| and in that course they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| taught the same thing he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| taught when he wanted to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| the course. Signing a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| paper doesn't make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| It just does not make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| happen. If at death is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| license automatically suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| or is it automatically revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| it is automatically terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| It is not a suspension or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| revocation which is terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| period period. There's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| living license holder. So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| is no license. The license goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| for the person. It's just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| anything else with death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Contracts are null after a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| certain point. OK. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| That's right. Thank you Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Chairman. The motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| floor is to we have no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| We've withdrawn a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| motion that's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| The original motion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| something. It's to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| consideration. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| original. My substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| in light of the fact that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| license is terminated would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| that the beer board take no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| action because the license is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| terminated. There's no one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| take action against. OK. Take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| no action. On a border I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| think we will vote on take no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| action. I mean we just we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| move on. Correct. But we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| motion on the floor that was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| defer defer consideration. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| understand. I'm just I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| trying to stand you know from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| parliamentary procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| standpoint. How do we. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| How do we vote on a take no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| action. Well you can take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| advice and say there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| action to be taken as a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| of record and go on or you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| make a motion that we take no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| action as a matter of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| and go on. It's at this body's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| discretion. OK. So that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| is appropriate. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| second. Do we have any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| discussion. OK. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| But how was this sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| compared with somebody that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| the death and there's a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| and there's property taxes. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| is sort of the same line. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| mean it got old some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| passed away. Does that the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| owner take that on. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| asking. No the new owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| doesn't take on property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| either. It goes to the estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| The state does. And this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| a liability that existed before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| death because there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| action taken. So whatever we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| today. It's kind of moot. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| That's the whole point. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Anything else. OK. Mr. Siddique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| I give you what you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| and you need to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| immediately. And so we wish you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| the best in the future. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| we're certainly sorry for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| loss of your father and hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| that we can go forward and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| have a fruitful business. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| you very much. OK. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| immediately cease and desist to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| make the phone call to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| everybody know and stop selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| beer. I also just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| generally say that you know I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| proud to be a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| community that I live in. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| call Knoxville my home. We run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| a business that's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| difficult. We try our best to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| do things that are productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=1619)|

| 0:40:52| hear a motion to accept consent? Motion to accept the consent items. Second. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. McKenzie. Two things. One, on Item 202, I'd asked the Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| last week, I had a question on 202, so he was going to, he didn't have information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| he was going to have someone from his building department, public, I don't know what department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| to address that. And then, I hate to do this, but on Item 906, I'd really like to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| that out. I'd like to discuss something on that one. Well, I don't know if it's, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2485)|
| 0:41:37| proper at this point. Okay, the agenda is set, but if it's not, I'm going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2497)|
| 0:41:54| move it. If it's agreeable with commission, we can allow both of these to be heard. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| any objections to that? So moved. Second. Okay, the motion's been made. Those will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| be heard. Thank you, Mr. McKenzie. Thank you. And again, I, you know, the Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| mentioned to me last week that he would bring someone on that, so I didn't know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| status was. But, and my question is, Dr. McIntyre, what was, again, I saw one with, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| with West Knox Utility, and it had a lot more detail about what utility, what the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2542)|
| 0:42:31| is for. So on 202, I just, there wasn't a lot of detail with what utility KUB's wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| to have in that easement and whatnot, so. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| McKenzie, I'm Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South Gay Street. The utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| easement in question is, I'm told, an electrical easement, and Mr. Jim French is here from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| our maintenance department, if there are any detailed questions about the easement itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| Is this above ground easement? No, sir, it's underground. And they want it underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| to keep from harming some trees and stuff. Okay, just, thank you. And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| on 906, I'm, I just struggle with the fact that we're going to end up giving whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2596)|
| 0:43:25| the successful candidates three days to leave office or come into office. I just think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| with us pushing this off, the end process off until our January 28th meeting, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| I think that's kind of unfair to all parties. And I'll ask something. I don't know if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| controversial or doable, but I know from our luncheon, when the Chief Judge, Chief Judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2630)|
| 0:44:01| dealing with the magistrates came forward, didn't seem to have an issue. Is it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| and proper for us to, it looks like all three sitting magistrates are in, can we just, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| know, give someone a decent Christmas and not have them potentially leave an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| in three days? Is that something? And really, we should be hearing these in December. December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| is the month that we should make our decision. Is there a way for us to make a decision today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| or, you know, with the information we've gotten, we've gotten that these three sitting folks are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2675)|
| 0:44:44| I haven't had any complaints from the city or the county sheriff's office, police office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| So I just ask a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Commissioner McKenzie, what we have here is that because of the way we push things back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| in the holiday period, the judges were not able to meet the December 15th notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| period for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| So their notification period goes to the 31st required by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| That's what made this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| And so because it is in the ordinance and they are judges, they asked for a waiver of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| the 15th requirement because they couldn't make that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| Understood. Again, I guess it's just my, it was my hope to try to dispose of this this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| But I'm guessing that's just not going to be doable. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| All we'd be voting on today would be the waiver, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| I'm going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2745)|
| 0:45:57| Could we have a motion to put it back on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Sure. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I think Dave has a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| You have a comment, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| I'll have to admit that I said to two or three different people that I thought today was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| decision day anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| And I was prepared to make a decision today and not, but Mr. Law Director, it's impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2779)|
| 0:46:31| for us to do that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| The notice and the KBA notice to those interested parties, the response date that was published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| was December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| So, and fair to the people who may want to apply and the notice requirement, to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| that notice requirement, it had to go through the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And that's, the judge has asked that we could get a waiver and that's what's before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| So, we'll proceed with the process as we anticipate in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| And so, this is back on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2831)|

| 0:48:20| I promise not to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| You just about ruined our Christmas, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| I promise not to do it again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Now, are we to the discussion item that, that for school security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Dr. McIntyre, will you brief us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, and we did take a few minutes this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2920)|
| 0:48:48| to talk about school safety and security, and certainly in light of the senseless violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2928)|
| 0:48:57| that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut on Friday, we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| to do a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| One was to reassure our community and our parents and our students and our, our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| and our staff that, that safety of our students and the security of our schools is our top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| priority every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| And also to offer some resources to our parents and our teachers about how to talk with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| about virtually inexplicable violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| And so we, we had a, an event with both Knoxville Police Department Chief David Rausch and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2971)|
| 0:49:42| County Sheriff J.J. Jones, and I really would like to publicly thank both of them and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| organizations for the extraordinary partnership that we have with law enforcement and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| schools here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And I would extend that to all of our first responders, and I see many of the folks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| rural metro here behind us who just do an extraordinary job in partnership and helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| us to keep our kids safe in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And I think that was the bottom line that we tried to communicate was that we will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| everything in our power to ensure the safety of our children in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| We have a wonderful partnership, and I think there's a number of strategies that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| put in place that are, you know, we believe enhance the safety and security of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| and the safety of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| And among those, things that the Board of Education has approved, and oftentimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| the commission has appropriated funds for, would include video monitoring systems at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| most of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Actually, almost all of our schools have a video monitoring system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| We are finishing up a multi-year effort to put locking hardware on the classroom doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3049)|
| 0:50:59| in all of our schools that lock from the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| And those mechanisms are in place in virtually all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| They will be in place in all of our schools by the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| That's been a multi-year effort in the capital plan that the county commission appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| funds for over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| We have what's called a secure vestibule at a growing number of our schools, where in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| order to enter the school, there's a set of doors that you can enter, and then a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| set of doors that would be locked, and that would make sure that folks filter into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| main office in order to access the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| And we also have camera buzzer systems at many of those schools where we do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| secure vestibules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| We have, in partnership with Knoxville Police Department and the Sheriff's Office, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| our own Knox County Schools security officers or sheriff's deputies or officers from KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| at all of our high schools, at all of our middle schools, and we have school resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| officers or security officers deployed to many of our elementary schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| Based on a policy that was adopted by the Board of Education a few years ago, we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| random searches for dangerous weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| We will, on a random basis, we will almost literally pick out of a hat a high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| or middle school to go to and set up metal detectors and run every third or fourth or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| sixth student through those metal detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| And it's an important security tool that we use, and we have used it frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| We have done random searches for dangerous weapons at 13 schools this school year thus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| far, and we have done them at least every middle school and high school over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| two to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| We have an anonymous text tip line where we can take tips from students and others regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3167)|
| 0:52:58| information about their safety in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We follow up on every one of those in conjunction with Knoxville Police and the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| We have a student and an adult threat assessment protocol that we use to identify and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| any potential threats to our schools and their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| We have an 800 megahertz radio communication system that we use within our schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| our school security operation that is interoperable with law enforcement in our community, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| leads to smooth communication in the event of a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And we have a school safety plan at each of our schools that is reviewed and updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| at least on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| And of course, periodically we take an opportunity at a specific school if the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| have changed or at all of our schools in light of an event like was experienced in Connecticut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| We'll review all of our school safety plans and make sure that they are up to date, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| we are doing everything we possibly can to keep our kids safe and that those safety plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| are being followed diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| And we've had twice in the last five years, we've had a comprehensive, in-depth review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| of our safety and security protocols by local law enforcement, by national experts on school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| safety, including the National Center for School Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| In addition, we have what I believe to be a unique and outstanding working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| with our law enforcement partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| We actually have a written memorandum of understanding between the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Department, the Knox County Sheriff's Office, and the Knox County Schools, which really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| delineates the terms of our working relationship and how we collaborate and communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| And it's been extraordinarily effective, and I compliment Chief Roush and Sheriff Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| for their willingness to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| We have joint training exercises between KPD and the Sheriff's Office and our school security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| And all of the officers who are deployed as school resource officers in our schools go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| through a fairly intensive training to become a school resource officer so that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| what it means to work in a school, what it means to be a police officer working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| children in a school setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| And those experiences, I think, are invaluable for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| We've sent resources, some resource materials, to all of our principals and to all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| school counselors around how to talk with children about safety and about violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| And we've posted similar resources on our website for our parents and for others in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| And that's at our website at KnoxSchools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| And we've tried to make those resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| You know, and it really talks about talking with children if they're asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| about what happened in Connecticut, to talk with our children about the fact that schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| generally are extremely safe places and that the adults in our students' lives, their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3352)|
| 0:56:01| their teachers, their principal, the police officers work very hard every day to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| make sure that they are safe in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| And of course, you know, it reminds us, you know, a tragedy like this reminds us, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| what a gift it is to work with kids and to be entrusted with their education and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| and how seriously we take that responsibility every day in the Knox County Schools and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| we will continue to do everything that we possibly can and everything within our power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| to keep our kids safe in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I'm sure this is a chilling event for all concerned, especially those who have the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| like you have of keeping kids and staff safe, so we appreciate those efforts and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| we'll continue to work at making schools as safe as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and if I may just take an opportunity to thank our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| and our school staff and our principals for their uncompromising dedication and commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| to our children and the work they do every day to keep our kids safe and to educate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| And thank you for your service as an educator for your life as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Madam Clerk, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| We are on page 9 on Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| It is amending the South County Sector Plan adopted by Resolution RZ-02-2-102 on February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3444)|
| 0:57:35| 5, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| We have an amendment that we've proposed and our law department has drafted this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| Mr. Buch, would you cover the amendment for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| After to give you the history so you can remember, MPC sent a sector plan amendment to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| There was some question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| It was not accepted the way MPC brought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| One of the main concerns was how the what is known as the Briggs Amendment on the treetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| and hilltop or hilltop preservation part of the plan was going to work within here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| The law department was charged with modifying that to meet that criteria and that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| that this board considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| So Daniel Sanders, who is not here today, came up with some wording that actually went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| into the sector plan plus what is on the resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| The resolution is to adopt the sector plan as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3528)|

| 1:01:30| I know Mr. Grunch, you would like to discuss this in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| I have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| We've got our – I did put back on to our discussion to be discussed this educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| finance concept that by statute we have been remiss in our duties in terms of covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3719)|
| 1:02:09| I guess I would like to start out just bridging from the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| The last time I remember that one thing that Mr. Hammond had to say was that it could be troublesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3734)|
| 1:02:22| in terms of maybe cultivating resentment or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| And I understand that very well because in the discussions that I had with the school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| and with Dr. McIntyre in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| there was a notion that sort of got out that this was going to be a joint committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| between school board members and county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| But according, I mean, what I see is I really see this as an opportunity to possibly overcome some of the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3772)|
| 1:03:07| maybe get over the wall, the financial wall that I feel exists between the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| and the rest of the county somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So I just – maybe this is a bit of a fanciful idea on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| but I do kind of envision a dialogue, more of a continual communication on budget matters between us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3804)|
| 1:03:36| and between the director and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Now, I guess one of those ideas is one thing that I do envision is something like, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| Dr. McIntyre is a teacher at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| And given that, and these are budget discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| I sort of envision a classroom almost with Dr. McIntyre leading the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| He's the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| We've got 11 fairly congenial students that are willing to learn and understand the school budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3847)|
| 1:04:19| and a very complex and ominous task, really, to understand that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Now, I would like to warn Dr. McIntyre about the class a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| It's maybe a heterogeneous class with some really sharp people on here financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| like I think about Mr. Shouse and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| And then there's some slow learners in the class, kind of like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And so anyway, I mean, I see it – I do see it as an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| And I hope that the school board and the administration see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| and we can move forward with that type of atmosphere as we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| But we're going to – a couple of ideas that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Also, I thought to not make this any more burdensome than it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| I was – and this is where the discussion comes in, and I'll shut up here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| But I thought that maybe the first session might be in February with the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3923)|
| 1:05:33| and possibly we form the committee in January formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| I really don't see the committee – I think the – I would prefer the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| to be composed of all of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| I don't – I really don't see the advantage of making a smaller – we've already got a small body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and then possibly the only other ideas that I had was maybe for the – for Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| get us up to date maybe in the first meeting, progress, financial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| that they've gone through in the first part of the school year and maybe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| and maybe an intro into the rest of their process for the year or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| And then the only other idea that I had about timing maybe as a follow-up to our normal monthly workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3976)|
| 1:06:25| So we didn't have another day to come and show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| A lot of times our workshops end up being a couple of hours and then maybe we could break for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| and then resume with a focus on educational budget matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| But really that's all the thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| That's very, you know, that's very sketchy and I realize that and almost purposely so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| because I want you guys to help us do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| But anyway, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| So I didn't see the first slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Who was – did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I think there's maybe a little bit of a breakdown in communication on what this committee should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| But what you're asking for here could be done as a presentation by Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| to the commission at a workshop and satisfy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| I don't think that that will satisfy the state-mandated educational committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| I think that to do that you're going to have to have a committee to look at issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| Some of it may be budgetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| But what we're looking at, you know, for this group is budgetary matters and finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| But the educational committee should be a committee that has some representation from several different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| It could be from business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| It needs to be from schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| It needs to be from possibly UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| It needs to be a couple, three members from this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| But that needs to be a separate committee to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Not as an advisory now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| The school board don't jump up and down and tell us we're trying to tell you what to do again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| But I think there needs for one of a better description, I would say, an informational sharing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| an idea sharing committee that can be taken back to both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| I think that's what the state requirement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| Am I not right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Well, we have two things in the statute that was presented the other day, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| One was just a reporting directly to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| I think that was 49-2-101-2, if I'm pulling this cold for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| And that's just a direct response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| And there were some specific statutorial items that the director of schools can send over to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| The other one was 49-2-101-3, which is more of a finance committee thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| And it was enumerated there what it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| But in addition to that, from the law department standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| there are several other finance committee issues throughout the code that kind of makes us need a finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4160)|
| 1:09:31| Or as an alternative, and this is up to this body how you want to address the things that are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| you can, you know, I think you have an agenda workshop sessions committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| or something that we took and formulated by resolution a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| And we used to handle these two things by the intergovernmental committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| which probably would have handled number two, and the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| which probably would have handled number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| The intergovernmental committee is only referred to in the charter, the code, once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| We could deal with that through the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| But the finance committee has, and I don't have them all enumerated here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| I had a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| I just don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Several times that there are specific responsibilities, not just with the school situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| but with other situations, whether it be budgetary, article amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| several things throughout the code and the charter that falls upon a finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| its many county commissions, its finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| And we don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| This body could decide to make the work session committee a, what would you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| intergovernmental finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Or you could break out and have a committee of a smaller group to be just the finance committee like you had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| You can create an education committee to address what Commissioner Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| You can create one to address what Chairman Norman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| The only legal issues that, as far as we're concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| is that you definitely need a finance committee function to do what is required of the finance committee by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4273)|
| 1:11:22| throughout the code and by the charter throughout the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| How this body wants to address those duties is entirely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| I know that's kind of ambiguous, but that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I'm trying to not get in the middle of how you want to deal with your own policy and your own structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| I'm just saying you have some functions out here that are not being handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| whether it be statutory or whether it be by code that you need a finance committee for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| And then Chairman Norman is interested in the school part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| which would have been the intergovernmental in past history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| So did that help you any, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| You said that the statute says that we need to basically quarterly receive a report from the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4328)|
| 1:12:17| And so you don't have to have a, quote, education committee to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| The county commission has to receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| So the second part of that is your feeling is that we need to be, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| a finance committee rather than just county commission for to satisfy code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| There's somewhere in the neighborhood or five or six different sections of the code that refers to reporting to a finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| several things, as well as the statute in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| And we really don't have a defined body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| You know, commission hasn't established a pipeline for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| And that would probably need to take place somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Whether you want, you know, it's just however you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I'm just wondering, Commissioner Norman's suggestion that we all serve as the, quote, education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| I'm just wondering if Mr. McIntyre couldn't come and present to us at our workshop session his report as we sitting commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4386)|
| 1:13:18| Do we really need to call ourselves an education committee since we're all going to be here anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And then I'm wondering, would we do our workshop and then briefly adjourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| and reconstitute ourselves as the, quote, finance committee during our workshop session so we don't have to have another meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| Do it all at that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| And we're all sitting as a finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| It's just that we just come in and adjourn the workshop session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| but we complete and come back into session as a finance committee to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| And that would be a time that the school superintendent could address us as the, quote, finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| I'm just throwing this out for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| That's totally, you know, up to this body, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| If you do that, what's the function of the educational committee then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Well, that's what I was asking is if we're all going to serve on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| I mean, you know, when he comes and addresses us quarterly, we're going to be sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| whether we call ourselves an education committee or the commission, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| Whatever committee it is anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Well, there was discussion about an education committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| which brought the statute in hand of the reports and things the commission needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| But I think the chairman had a purpose for an education committee unbeknownst to the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4472)|
| 1:14:41| In so doing, you know, we discovered at least one point of a finance committee that was not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| And then that let us look to other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| So however this body wants to deal with the duties and responsibilities of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and however you want to formulate your committees is entirely up to your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| And you all have the power to do it any way you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| So I was just saying that the duties that are remiss are more of a finance committee piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| And there is the school reporting part, the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| But we have a county commission, so that's not an issue one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| But this communication thing between I think that the chairman is bringing is a third and separate part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| of what the law department was saying what we really needed to do, if that makes it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4527)|
| 1:15:36| Well, it's certainly there's a lot of ways to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| And I agree with you, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| about probably a simple solution might be just to convene a finance committee right after a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4544)|
| 1:15:53| And then you're dealing with the I think you're satisfying what we're required to do, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| Now, the law director may jump me after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| So we'll see about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| You know, and I guess you all, you guys, sounds like you hashed out a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| But it didn't sound like that was the way the conversation was going initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| So I don't know, Mr. Chair, if you have other aspects other than this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4580)|
| 1:16:30| probably intentionally, you know, specific duties of this body as it relates to education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4590)|
| 1:16:40| and this formation of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| If so, then I think that's maybe we have a separate dialogue about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| But I did want to at least give an invitation to the superintendent to see if he had a thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| or if he wanted to weigh in on this process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner McKenzie, thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| From the perspective of the school board, obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| you all need to meet your obligations as a body as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| And certainly the school board has no particular interest in how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| But I think there is a strong interest among the members of the school board to have some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| of a joint education committee where there are members of both the accounting commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and the school board sitting together, meeting on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| talking about how we work collaboratively, talking about the budget development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| talking about investments in education, talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| how we continue to have a strong working relationship and dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| I know that that's a very strong interest on the part of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| You know, obviously, you all have to meet your obligations in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| of the statutory requirements however you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| But I know that the board is very interested in having a joint education committee of some form where that collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| and that dialogue can be structured and regular in terms of the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| and hopefully really support a level of discourse that will be productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| and collaborative for all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Well, so, you know, I remember it probably was an experiment failed, but when I was in elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| they had split classes, you know, third and fourth grade or fourth and fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| So, Mr. Chair, if you're interested in that, your classroom scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| maybe Dr. McIntyre could teach a subset of commission and a subset of school board folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| in terms of a separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| I'm certainly open to whatever you all think is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| And absolutely, I understand and appreciate the school board's desire to get with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| and increase communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| You know, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| In fact, you know, another thing that we want to talk about and think about is how we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| or how we did it in the past this year via retreats and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| If we want to do that, Ms. Carson's wanting to hear from us about those possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| So, yeah, I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| But certainly we've got to address the budget issue as a distinct and separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| And I think that's done best by commissioners alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| And then possibly we have another, you know, another committee to join with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I agree that we need to deal with the finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Well, it's our duties to handle the financial piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| You know, and I guess the last word I'll say about, you know, any committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| it's kind of what I think Commissioner Wright kept trying to beat home to us during the luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| is, you know, committee, we can do, we can form whatever committee we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| But at the end of the day, it's going to be the votes of this commission that's going to make the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| So, you know, I don't know if the school board was worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I know I've got to call it to about, you know, a big overthrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| I don't think that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| So I agree that this probably two-pronged approach is probably best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| Maybe have a superintendent come to us to discuss the financial piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| and maybe we consider a subset of us and a subset of board members to deal with education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| And I'd be willing to serve if you're so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| Okay, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| And so why don't we, we can't solve this today, but we can bring some structure, I think, in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4861)|
| 1:21:11| to address both of these issues, propose those in January, and then see if that's acceptable to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Does that sound reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Yeah, I'd like to make just a couple of comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| And first of all, you know, what I believe in is we really need to segregate the functions of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| And I think this is really almost a statutory issue, is that the school board makes policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| and we find out ways to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| What I would envision the commission's education, I sort of agree with what everyone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| and I disagree with what everyone says, is I would look at the commission's education committee as an entity that attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4908)|
| 1:21:57| to find ways to finance what the school board says they need to do for the plans to educate the kids as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4917)|
| 1:22:07| And what we have to do is to sit down with them and find out, is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| What we don't need is for the school board to submit a budget that's so pie in the sky that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4931)|
| 1:22:21| that the community and the citizens don't say we're not going to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| And the commission says because of the citizen input that we can't finance this is to have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| and it could be, you know, four and four or something, is to sit down with the school board, sit down with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| And I would like to remind everybody the superintendent doesn't make the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| He didn't even get a vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| The school board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| And that's why they need to be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| And they need to hear what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Because I really don't want to go through the same process we had last year where it may have been a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| But I think that if we would have seen the plan ahead of time and had the opportunity to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| we also got to bring the mayor in on this, too, because he's the one that the school board sends the budget to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| And then we have some of the adjustments that are made after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| But to have them sit down and say, this is the amount of money we need, this is why we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| And then we have to say, how are we going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Or can we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Do we need to shift more stuff over to the capital budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Because interest rates are so low right now, we're almost able to get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| I'm not going to say you get money for nothing, but you're not paying very much for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| But it may give us the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Why interest rates are at historical lows is to take an opportunity to do some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| and to move forward some of the capital costs we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| And we can tell, you know, we can tell the school board that maybe is there anything we can shift over to get done now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| Why interest rates are low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| It does involve borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| It does involve increasing the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| But this is a rare opportunity to get money really cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| The second thing is, is that if there's some operational expenses they need, we can look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| and talk about those with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| And what the school board can do is tell us what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| And then we can tell them, is this realistic that we can get the money for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| I mean, if we're going to have, you know, a 35-cent tax increase that we saw last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| it turned out really not to be realistic, you know, for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| But there may be ways that we can still get the school board to where to get the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| and the school board to where they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| But, you know, we need to talk to them about it because we're the ones that have to carry the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| We're the ones that are going to get hit, you know, with this when it comes to going to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| and asking for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| And that's where I would see you almost need a joint committee is where you have the school board saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| this is what we want to do and this is how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| And we're sitting here trying to find a way to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| And I think that that way the school board is making policy, they're telling us what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| and we're doing our duty by trying to find a way to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| And that's how I would envision this type of committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| And I say I agree and disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| And I do agree with what, you know, Mike said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| We may need to have a larger look at this is where we do bring in commissioners, school board people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| business leaders and all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| To me, that should be driven more by the school board because what that would do is change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| I mean, we can be part of it, but that needs to be more school board because those are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| that are going to establish policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| They can see what the community needs, what business is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| And then they need to construct programs and policies to satisfy those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| so these kids can get jobs when they get out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Those are the folks that have got skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| And those are the folks that have got some innovative ideas that wouldn't be in big business today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| But we don't change policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| It's the school board that has to change policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| But, you know, we need to be part of that process just like the school board needs to understand the financing aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| And I think what happened last year, and I don't think there's a person sitting up here right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| that wants to go through what we went through last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| I thought that was a very one of the most difficult things we've done in the last four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| But I do think that what the schools are talking about is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| But we just have to find a way that we can sell to the public on how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| And that's what we can help the school board with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| It sounds like the discussion is in favor of both of these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5184)|
| 1:26:33| one that deals with finance and then one more of a joint committee that's a policy-oriented discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| And so why don't I work on this with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| and we'll bring some proposal forward for January in terms of structure of these committees, if that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| Does that sound reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| And we all lived happily ever after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Now, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| What else do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| We have adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Do we have any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| Any public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Would anybody like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| I have some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| J.J., you want to speak, J.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| We'll let you attend class with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Have we adjourned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Happy birthday to John Mills today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| So, all right, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Have a happy holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121217?start=5263)|
