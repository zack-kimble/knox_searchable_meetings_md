| 0:04:09| And finally, I want to share some great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Tomorrow, Knoxville will be officially recognized by AARP as a member of its age-friendly communities network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=252)|
| 0:04:21| Being in the AARP age-friendly community means that local leadership, that's us, all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| has made a commitment toward making the city a great place to live for people of all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| So by investing in infrastructure that promotes walkability and transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| or by supporting affordable housing or creating fully accessible outdoor spaces in our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| we're doing our part to become a more inclusive, welcoming city that everyone can enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| We want Knoxville to be comfortable and functional for all its residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| whether it's families with children who need a place to play or young adult outdoor adventurers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| or people with disabilities or senior citizens who might need accessible homes and public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| So is Mitch Olchewski here with us? Mitch, yeah, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| So I'd like to invite Mitch Olchewski to come to the podium to tell us some more about the AARP network of age-friendly communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=311)|
| 0:05:20| Mitch serves on the AARP Tennessee Livability Council, and he's the AARP volunteer leader for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Mitch, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| And I want to add my congratulations on behalf of AARP for you being accepted into the network of age-friendly communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=329)|
| 0:05:40| This is not an automatic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| You have to fill out an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| I was discussing a little earlier with a couple of staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| This is probably the quickest I have ever seen AARP accept an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| It took literally 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| They looked at it and said, oh, my God, these people are great, and approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| So I want to echo what the mayor is saying, that your efforts have made Knoxville a very, very good place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=362)|
| 0:06:11| And just to kind of go over what the mayor said, being in the network basically says that the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Knoxville in this case, strives for livability that meets the need of all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Yes, we're AARP, but we represent all ages in this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| And just so that you know, you did establish a leadership position in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| You're the first large community to enroll in the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| Other communities saw what you were doing, and Chattanooga and Memphis have followed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| And so you have established that leadership position not only by what you're doing, but by enrolling in the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| And tomorrow we'll give the official certificate to the mayor at the luncheon meeting at the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| I believe you're all invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| So if you'd like to show up for that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| And once again, it was great working with you, Mayor, and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| Excellent people to work with, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you, Mitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| And we know that this designation doesn't mean that we have made it, that we're totally age-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| It means that we have made strides and continue to make strides to make Knoxville more livable for all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| So we've got plenty to brag about already, but we know there's a lot more we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Okay, so that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Yeah, I just want to make sure everyone is aware that the 4th District neighborhood of 4th & Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| is having their annual fundraiser and neighborhood tour this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| It's on Sunday from 1 to 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| And you can get advance tickets from their website, which is 4thandgill.org, for $12 or by the day of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| But this is an opportunity to go in and see some of the homes and visit the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| and see one of our original neighborhoods here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| And it's just a great opportunity to meet the people in the neighborhood as well and kind of see where we began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| So I invite everybody else to come out and support that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| as they raise funds for events and projects within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=514)|

| 0:08:42| but specifically those with Project RAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I know that they had their awards banquet on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| I also want to congratulate all of those students from Austin East as well as Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| For those that are in the audience and those who are watching who have actually come out to the school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| I just want to thank everyone for coming out and expressing their support for these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| But more importantly, I understand that these were some of the biggest crowds that we've seen at a public meeting downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| And I just want to especially thank everyone for being orderly and being respectful of other people when they were speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=553)|

| 0:14:19| has many projects that we pursue on our own, many grants that we give out within the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| community and then we have a special category of our contributions and that is our public-private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| partnerships with the city. And those public-private partnerships surround the Urban Wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=868)|

| 0:14:48| on a lot of public-private partnership and since I have the opportunity, I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| to thank the city staff. This is one of the best city staffs I've ever worked with. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=892)|

| 0:15:30| of very many generous donations by the Aslan Foundation. Since 2008, they have invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=930)|

| 0:15:44| in our community. What's most impressive about Aslan is not only their financial commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| but how insistent and involved they are in really getting things done. They get results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| or at the table. They don't just hand you the money and go away. They're at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=955)|

| 0:18:49| Thank you. Lincoln Lincoln, 1715 North Hills Boulevard, Zip 17. I've had a long-term interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1129)|
| 0:19:00| in trolleys, trolley transportation, efficiency, equity, etc. This project has a long history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| at least even with this body. In October, you approved, as a council, the city to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| some property on Summit Hill Drive between Locust Street and Wallet Street. The intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| purpose of this was as a result of CAT requesting to build what they termed a ramp. That slid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| through city council in a fairly rapid manner. There were very few questions. In fact, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| were no explanations of exactly what this project was. It has now come before you, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| coming before you for financing to the tune of $213,000, having spent previously $82,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1182)|
| 0:19:51| on acquiring property. This project is now named, and I quote, the CAT Summit Hill Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| Stop Project, which is kind of a long moniker. I believe that this moniker is not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| to what the purpose of this ramp is. I believe that it really should read the Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| CAT Trolley Stop Elimination Project. Again, this has a fair history. Summit Towers is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| a Section 8 building at 201 Locust Street, populated by almost 300 souls. 100% of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| are elderly. I wish the ARP guy were still here for me. The balance of, in addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1234)|
| 0:20:43| 100%, both elderly and disabled, or both. In addition, 24% of that population is minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1243)|
| 0:20:55| This building has been served since time immemorial by the trolleys at a rate that is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| half of what that route is able to provide. At the time of this change, and the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| of a ramp, Summit Towers received 42 servicings a day, that route being capable of 81 servicings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| In other words, they got half service. When the ramp was proposed, I'm sorry, before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| ramp was proposed, CAT surveyed a portion of the riding public. They came out with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1288)|
| 0:21:37| to change routes. The recommendation to change routes was pretty drastic at Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| because CAT didn't think they should serve Summit Towers at all. In other words, 81 rotations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| of the trolley, 42 to Summit Towers, to zero. No justification or reason was ever given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| by the CAT officials, even though people asked, particularly me. An outcry of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| produced a compromise. That compromise was that CAT would service Summit Towers a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| of eight times a day over seven hours. The trolleys run up to 13 hours a day. You go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| from a route capable of 81 to 42, they wanted to take it away, they compromised at eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| and they produced this ramp idea. I don't know how that accomplishes the purpose. Many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| of these people can hardly get up the ramp in the front of the building in order to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| the trolley. There are people who are in chairs, not even power chairs. There are people missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| limbs. There are people who are 90. How you could cut off or reduce service to a population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| in the city using public funds under public laws is, to me, a very difficult situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| to accept. In fact, I cannot accept it. This project needs to go on some kind of a hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| and I would request the council retain someone who knows something about transit, disabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| and elderly populations, and the government standards. I believe this project is contradictory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1393)|
| 0:23:22| and violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in regard to minorities and the Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| with Disabilities Act of 1990. I think we need to fix this. I love our trolley system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| Our trolley system should move with the times and the public. Our city, the core of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| is expanding over the river and up the Fifth Avenue, should be looked at, should be planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| for so that trolleys can service those people. So we do not end up with autos, congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| and the scar of more huge concrete parking lots in our skies. Thank you. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| you. Okay, council, because there are so many new council members since this whole situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| started, I'd like to ask Don Dissler to come up and just to briefly address what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| about. Good evening. Don Dissler, Director of Transit for the City. We're excited that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1453)|
| 0:24:25| this accessible pathway is now coming to fruition and we're finally breaking ground on it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| is a long time coming. We've been working on this for quite some time. Back about 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| months ago, we did what we called Trolleys on Tap. We went out and talked to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| We got a lot of feedback from the public about what they would like to see the trolley system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| be. So doing this, we sat down and talked to a lot of different people. We went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| They actually drew on a map, told us where they'd like to see things go. We went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| a quite extensive process. And with this process, we were able to actually expand the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| system budget neutral. We did not have to add any money to do this. We were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| extend hours as well as extend areas. We were able to bring the trolley system to run later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| at night, to run on Saturdays. One of the trolley routes, which is the green route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| still goes up to Summit Towers. It does run up to Summit Towers. We did an extensive survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| of that system and of the ridership on that system for the green route. And we found that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| the passengers getting on at Summit Towers were very low compared to the number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1548)|
| 0:25:58| the trolley was going through that area and up through Summit Towers. The trolley was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| also getting stuck up there quite often because it is very congested. So one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| we did is we did talk to a lot of the residents that were up there as well as the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| of Summit Towers. And we talked about what we could do to help that, what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| to expand the trolley service and still provide a front door service up to Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| When we did this, we found out that one of the big requests of folks at Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| was that the trolley come there on the weekends also. Now, we only run on Saturdays, not on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Sundays. But we were actually able to provide trolley service up to Summit Towers on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| as well as Monday through Friday. We continued to provide it during the hours that what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| call kind of off-peak hours, hours where there's not as much congestion, hours when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| not as much traffic for people who are going back and forth to work and school and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| like this. So one of the things that we worked with Stephanie Cook, who is the ADA coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| for the city, we spoke with her about what are the best ways to keep this accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| to make it accessible. At the bottom of, over by where this stop will be, where a shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1633)|
| 0:27:23| and a trolley stop will be, will also be a fixed route bus stop. So actually this pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| will provide an accessible pathway for wheelchairs, people with disabilities. It will be lighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| It will have handrails. It will have a retaining wall. It will have benches partially up so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| that people who, you know, with COPD and things like that who can't make a walk can stop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| rest if they need to do so or just sit down and just enjoy this because it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| be gorgeous when it's all done. It's going to be a really cool pathway. And that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| way we figured it out. We went up with engineering. We went up with Stephanie. My group went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| We looked at different ways that we could get folks down to the stop to make their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| more independent, to make it so that they can get to and from things later at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| earlier in the day, seven days a week. There is still lift service that is available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| folks at the towers if they qualify and they sign up for it. So the lift service will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| available still there. And I really think this is going to add to the, not just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| trolley service, but it's going to add to the quality of life for the people who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| at the top of this hill because this is going to make it so much easier for them to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| down, to use the regular bus service as well as the trolley service, to be able to, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| I said, lead independent lives, to get where they need to go when they want to go, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| just, you know, in advance or having to call a day or two days ahead of time or rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| friends or neighbors or whoever it is to come get them. This will actually help their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| and make them able to be more independent and I think this is really going to add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| the CAT system itself and add to the folks at Summit Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Ms. Dishler. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| So what are the limitations to being able to get lift? That's one question. And then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| second question. So if I heard you correctly, you're actually able to expand trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| service in some regards by offering weekends when you were not offering weekends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| Summit Tower, but also later and earlier times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| That's correct. So what this allows, well, first of all, let me answer your first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| question. The lift service is a service that's available to people who have disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| which prevent them from riding the regular fixed route service. So if someone can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| to that stop, if someone has a disability that keeps them from getting to the stop, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| lift service is available. It is an application that is filled out. There's usually some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1808)|

| 0:30:18| will prevent them from using the service. They get an ID card and then all they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| do is call for the service. Now the service that they're calling for, they do have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| call for it in advance. So they have to plan. They have to call at least 24 hours ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| of time to be able to use that service. When we talked about the hours for the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| system, when I said the, when we redid the entire trolley system, we were able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| budget neutral by making a lot of changes, not just Summit Towers. We made a lot of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| to the way we run the trolley system. We instituted a super stop for the trolley system which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| allows all three trolley routes to come together at intervals during the day and in the evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| so that people can transfer from one trolley to the next trolley and they can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| get around the entire downtown area as well as out to the UT campus for free because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| trolley system is free. The trolley did not go up into Summit Towers on Saturdays. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| now, it does go up there on Saturdays. It is less frequent. I mean, I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| sugar coat that. It's less frequent than what it went before we redid the trolley system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| But that frequency was not being utilized. That frequency was something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| if you have ten people get on the vehicle and they all get on pretty much at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| time or, you know, five get on here and five get on there and you're able to provide a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| service that still kind of mimics what you're doing, it is a little less frequent but people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| can adjust to that. We did have folks that came out to the KTA meetings, Mr. Lincoln| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| as well as other people from Summit Towers, and they came and talked to us and they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| thanked us for, you know, giving them service that allows them to go out on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| now to go to the grocery store or to go to things that they want to go to. They also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| we talked to the management. The management was, you know, with us. They came over. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| talked to us on a couple of different occasions. At the time, we talked to Alvin Nance when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| we first started doing this and Alvin was the KCDC head and we talked to him about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| He was supportive of the idea. It allowed us, like I said before, to run the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| trolley service later at night on Fridays and Saturdays. We were able to run that trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| service until 10 o'clock at night. We were able to do things where people had a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| direct line up to this building, the City-County building on the blue line. It allows them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| to utilize other parking decks, the parking deck down by the Civic Auditorium, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| can just jump on a trolley and shoot straight up the hill to get to work and where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| need to get to. We were able to service the Old City, which was something we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| doing before. And the Old City now has service. That service is starting to grow. It takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| a while to actually get a transit service that people know they can depend on and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| start to see it and they want to be on it. And so that service is growing also. We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| see kind of a drop in our trolley ridership at first because that happens. It goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| when you change something. Now we're starting to see that trolley service just grow. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| more people riding on the blue lines, there's more people riding on the orange line now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| and the green line is beginning to grow also. So this is what I'm talking about when I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| that there's more service as a whole throughout the city. And I just think that it's a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| better trolley service now, and this is going to just actually enhance the lives of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| people at Summit Tower so that they can use the regular service as well as the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you. Any other questions? All right, so we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| No, sir, you're not able to ask the questions. You had your five minutes. So, okay, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2067)|

| 0:34:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2093)|

| 0:35:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| We need voice vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| No, no voice vote. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I mean, you don't have to have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| No roll call needed on this one, but thank you for checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Okay, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Andrew Hurst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| to perform conservation and restoration of all oil and photographic portraits of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| mayors, including frames, as needed, in an amount not to exceed $38,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I really like that Andrew Hurst is local and that this is helping with keeping our money local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| But to me, $38,000, it feels like a self-aggrandizing expenditure of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2163)|
| 0:36:13| So those are my feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| The administration's feeling is that we've got these historic paintings of former mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2179)|
| 0:36:30| They are part of the history of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| And there's quite a few, I don't know how many, most mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| We have most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| And so this is a little bit of money that goes to restore them and restore them properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| so they can continue to be part of our history, show the history of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2203)|
| 0:36:53| Good and reasonable people disagree, as we often say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| So have we had work done to them in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Ms. Foltz, would you like to come up and talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| We just do not have to spend the money, but unfortunately some bad decisions were made in years gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, Judith Foltz, Director of Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| Yes, the paintings were all put together back during the Testerman years, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| Janet Testerman was actually one of the major components of this plan to gather up all of these paintings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2248)|
| 0:37:41| They were in attics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| They were in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| They were all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| They brought them, she brought them into City County and assembled as many as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| And they did the best they could with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| A lot of the paintings have gold leaf and they've been spray painted gold over the gold leaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| A lot of them have oil with glass over them, which is, you do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| It has become a major issue with moisture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| One of them turned totally white and we have just gotten that one repaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2295)|
| 0:38:25| and no one actually was able to save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| We thought it was totally ruined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| We had two fall off the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| These frames are very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| A lot of them are from the 1800s and they don't make frames like that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| So Dr. Hurst is actually spending a lot of time painstakingly repairing to preserve the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2320)|
| 0:38:51| So there's about 36 of them that we have to literally remove the glass from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| then restore the painting back to what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Or if we leave them alone and we don't do anything with them, they will disintegrate beyond repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| That's my fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And I feel like this is a really important thing for us to be preserving this history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| We have actually won the very first mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| He's going to be going out to be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| But it's an expensive procedure to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| We are hoping it won't cost the total amount, but we put that number in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| because of some of the major damage to the frames, which takes a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| and of course the mold and all the other damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| But that's basically what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| So it passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| So now those are all consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| So we're now on ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| 12A is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $10,000 towards sponsorship of the fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| for the memorial statue honoring Febb and Harry Byrne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180424?start=2427)|
