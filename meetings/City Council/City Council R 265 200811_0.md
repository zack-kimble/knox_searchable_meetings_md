| 0:20:25| have died from that exposure starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| in their early 40s, all from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1228)|

| 0:20:40| He is the last survivor. Each year, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| has to go to have medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| examinations to determine what that exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| has done to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Bill's mother bought this property in 1967| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1252)|

| 0:20:58| I sent a photo, which I hope all of you received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| of his mom, a white-haired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1261)|

| 0:21:10| taken, but that's a 1968 GMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1270)|

| 0:21:16| for four years. You can see in that photo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| that his mother is standing on asphalt pavement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| backyard. The boat shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| in the photo is under a carport where the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1285)|

| 0:21:37| I say, that has been there in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| for the entire period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1300)|

| 0:21:55| for unreasonable hardships. Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1315)|

| 0:22:04| will it cost to demolish apparently multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1324)|

| 0:22:16| and then re-sod it? Thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| or tens of thousands of dollars? Bill's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| daughter, to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1342)|

| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| That concludes all the people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| All right. Thank you, Mr. Cole, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| speaking and presenting that side of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| I would like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| our council, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| Frost, to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| section 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| appendix B of our code for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| hardship is based upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you, because you all have heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| before. Variances will be granted only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| where such special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| or conditions exist, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| exceptional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| narrowness, topography or siding, as fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| described in the findings of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| The aforesaid circumstances or conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| are such that the strict application of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| provisions of the code would deprive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| applicant of any reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Mere loss in value does not justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| a variance. There must be a deprivation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| the beneficial use of the land. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| variance granted under the provisions of this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| must be the minimum adjustment necessary for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| applicant to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| provide a reasonable use of the land, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| the granting of any variance is in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| with the general purpose and intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| code. It will not be injurious to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| neighborhood, detrimental to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| welfare, or in conflict with the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| As an aside, I have appreciated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| comments made by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| applicant. I have listened closely to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| what he had to say to the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| council. However, respectfully, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| while my family has had members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| serve in the military, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| service in the military is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| one of the criteria allowed to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| a variance. I don't mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| be biased. I don't mean to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| biased in terms of whether it was abroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| or whether it was in Oak Ridge. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| respectfully, that's not grounds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| granting these, what, seven or eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| variances. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| So, what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| before us and what I see from reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| the packet from the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Committee, is that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| variance specific about the land that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| created the hardship and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| inability to use the land, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| does not exist. I don't see that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| are voting to issue a demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| permit. What specifically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| application says is that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| issuing variances to enable the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| construction of additional structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| to exist. And one thing that stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| out to me in the transcript from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Board of Zoning Appeals was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| the structures are all built on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| land not owned by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| and that KUB, whose land it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| has already asked some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| offense to be removed that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| not owned by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| So, I think that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| variance specific about the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| that created the setback and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| there are safety issues, which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| they won't sell the additional land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| for the variances or for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| additional, for the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| I think it's of note the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| about the variances. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| variances are asking us to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| a setback of 1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| inches for the first one, 1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| inches for the second one, 4.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| inches for the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| The fourth one is 1.7 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| from the required, so it's from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| 15 feet to 13 and some feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Number five is over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| 240% increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and so it goes with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| eight variances. They're pretty extreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| because the structures were on different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| lands. So, I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Mr. Cole's comments, but they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| meet the standard for a variance, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| stated in the packet, which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| the Board of Zoning Appeals voted 5-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| for this. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I'm not comfortable setting the precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| of approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| based on structures that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| inherited and built without permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| to enable the purchase of property because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| that is what is presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| So, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| that basis, I would make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| disapprove the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Okay. There's a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| do you mean deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| I'm sorry, motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Motion made by Council Member Ryder to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| the appeal. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| Motion made by Council Member Ryder, seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| by Council Member Smith. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| further discussion? Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I have a question perhaps for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Mr. Frost, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| thinking of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| sequence of events, it seems odd to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| the applicant for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| variance is able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| apply for that variance before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| owning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Council Member Parker, in some circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| might make an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| generally speaking, to rezone a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| before they purchase it because they want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| whether or not they will be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| sell the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| before they actually close on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And I believe that before KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| will sell the land to Mr. Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| he must obtain the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| So, KUB is willing to sell the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Personally, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| I'm sorry, Mr. Frost, did you have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I was done. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| It was actually me, and I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| if you want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I didn't know if Council Member Ryder knew the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Yeah, on page 26 of the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| KUB, and they were one of the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| so it's in the transcript from BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| they are only willing to sell the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| before they actually close on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| So, to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| you have to have your variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| That was the need for the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| to be able to make the sale go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| The property has to be replatted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| They can't sell feet and inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| They have to sell it platted together as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| And since the structures exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I wanted to clarify something you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| They would be able to purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| that the structures currently sit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| if a variance is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| something you were saying earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| that they wouldn't be able to buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| from KUB because KUB found it to be dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| That was too close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| So, in the transcript| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| from the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I'll have to go back down through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| BZA package starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| on page 24 of our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| It's been a few hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| since I read it, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| it said something in the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2003)|
| 0:33:34| Hold on. Let me find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| There's a speaker from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Billy Joe McCarley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| This is Billy Joe McCarley with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| You asked a question about the proximity to the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| There's a tower right behind the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I'm not familiar with the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| of any type of NEC codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| In addition to that, we still have room to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| and maintain our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| There was a fence that was also installed on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| and we did ask Mr. Clark to remove that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| The fence caused NEC safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Somewhere in the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| or in, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| where the building actually sits and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Go think in the packet, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| What page is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Go to page 42 in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I guess the conversation with Daniel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and Aaron Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Last paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Aaron Tomlinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| KUB is only willing, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| to allow the building to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| underneath the garage and the carport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| and the back and, of course, the existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| all structures are existing and those would also be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| the structures on the existing lot would also need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| variances as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| So the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| is that do we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| a precedent, which is directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| someone building someone, not Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| If I bought Mr. Clark's property, I would have the same problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| multiple structures without permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| on other people's land and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| ending up in a situation where you could purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| that the items sit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| if you can get variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| for the required setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| that are safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| proximity of buildings to other structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and other people's property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| And they discuss that as a precedent-setting issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| in the transcript, which is why I'm inclined to not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| The reason why I wanted to discuss those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| and clarify your arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| and I thank you so much for taking the time to go through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| because my reading of it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| it did fit into the hardship request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| narrow definition of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| property would be allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| The fact that it has been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| for so long, I do think that it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| who the property owner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| to understand the hardship that they are experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| these late years in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Although this is not a permit for demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I believe if we do not grant the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| what we are saying is that these structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| are not allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And ultimately, the property owner will likely have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| remove the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| And so I'm glad this came back before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| because I feel that the lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| was able to help me see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| what the situation is that this is a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| You know, last time we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I wasn't sure if this is something that had been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| within the last 10 years. To me, that's a different situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| than something that was built 50 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and we're simply asking for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| so those structures can remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| but we're not saying that anything can be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| So that's why I'm inclined to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| The motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Are there any further comments or questions on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Mr. Swanson, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I just wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| that what the law is with regard to the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| of the land is it's got to be associated with the narrowness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| or topography or unusual way in which the land lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| We have not heard anything in this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| about some unusual way in which this land lies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| or that it's unusually narrow or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| So really, we have heard nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| in the appeal itself to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| a qualification for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| variance here. There's also some discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| whether this might be something like a pre-existing non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| It is not a pre-existing non-conforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| because it was illegal when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| And it doesn't matter how long it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| If it was illegal when it started, it stays illegal throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| So I just want Council to be aware of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| I have a question, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Would you not say that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| a generally accepted principle within property law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| that things are grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| over 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Not for variances, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you. This is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| If I understand this correctly, KUV hasn't said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| he has to tear this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| City codes isn't saying that it has to be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| It just says that whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| it will be a problem if he goes to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| or his estate goes to sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| because those buildings will not transfer with the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| But he should be able to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| to have the enjoyment and use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I haven't heard anybody say that they're going to make him tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I don't think that was anywhere in the record, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| if the variances aren't granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| and the sale won't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| that would remain KUV's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| And I guess as the property owner, it would be up to KUV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| But they haven't said they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| anything at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| You can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| You're not KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I'm just saying that wasn't in the transcripts anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| And I have not spoken with KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Nor should you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| I'll just say that in the transcript from BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| that KUV is not KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| So I'll take them at that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you, Council Member Fugate and Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So on that note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| and I remember asking Director Aarons, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| when this was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| if we don't overturn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and the city then pursue a demolition permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| or request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| And I felt like I heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| when this was before us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| I mean, I'm struggling with this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| given the longevity that these structures have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| There hasn't been any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| from the neighbors or surrounding landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| KUV has seemed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| be wanting to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| So my concern would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| would the city pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| this property owner, Mr. Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| to demolish the current structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I don't think we can answer that question at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Because at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| there's been no complaint filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| about the existence of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| There's just been the request for these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| We don't have enough enforcement capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| to go out and enforce these types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| without a complaint as a general rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| And so it doesn't come to our attention and we don't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| In this situation, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| there's been no complaint filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| But if a complaint should be filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| I don't think that we can say that we won't require the structure to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| I think the law would require if somebody complains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| and we come in and they ask us to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| We're not going to tell you in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| that we're not going to enforce the law in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Would the only complainant potentially be KUV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| They're certainly a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| They're the bordering property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| They would be the logical complainant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| We don't limit complaints to just a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you, Mr. Swann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Did you have more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| No, I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So in the event that Mr. Clark needed to sell his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| to provide for his care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| would he be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| I don't know who has the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| I don't have an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| That would be a title lawyer question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| I've never been a title lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| I might try that in my next career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I mean, based on what's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| I would gather that it would be an issue to a certain degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| I don't know who has the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| I don't know who has this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| It appears to me at some juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| So I think that's a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| If that would come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and the ability for him to be able to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| his property in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Just to clarify, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| is it possible for someone to purchase this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| without the variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| I think that's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| to purchase the land without the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Whether a purchaser is going to be willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Because there may be some problem with title insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| when you're encroaching upon someone else's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| I would defer that to someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| who has more expertise than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| But along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Mr. Clark was able to purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| with these structures already on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| if they preceded him, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| I didn't really understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Mr. Clark was able to purchase the land with these structures already on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| if they preceded him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| I think maybe those structures got created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| when his mother owned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| I was calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I think actually this could create good precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| property disputes to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| and find the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| And they're relying on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| to kind of acknowledge that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| You know, KUV has asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| that if they're going to keep those structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| well, I can't say it in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| but has asked that the property be purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| that the structures are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| And they did not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| that they were building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| on someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| And that's hard to verify 50 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| But it seems also in our processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| we should have some sort of grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| for those who might have made mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| and are now working to remedy those mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| have worked with the other parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I don't think that this encourages folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| to just build property illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| on other people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| but perhaps encourages, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| the parties involved to find those resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and then seek tools within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| to help them resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Mr. Cole is seeking recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| to address or call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Council, would you like to hear from Mr. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| He's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Mr. Cole, would you unmute him please, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Mayor, I was going to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| to some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| that many of the representatives had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| However, I believe they have all been properly answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| as to sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| For what that's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| I was involved in a state some years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| that was trying to sell an old gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| that had an environmental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| because the tanks leaked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| and we couldn't give the property away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| And I imagine until all of these variance items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| are corrected or taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| for that to be sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| because of residential disclosures and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| the purchaser would know that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| purchasing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| that was going to be a financial headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Is Mr. Ahrens on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| and we could ask him a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| or I could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| is there anything you could add to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| when we have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| or how often do we see a situation where things are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| illegally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| I'm not pointing a finger at anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I don't know who built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| They predate the current title holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| But they're built illegally and they don't meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| of the current title holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| And I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| if you have heard of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| seeking forgiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and it's like a created hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| and isn't that something that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| ends up at the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Yes, ma'am, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| It is a created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| It is a created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| It's something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| found every once in a while in BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| and when you're seeking forgiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| that would mean asking for the variance after you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| created the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| And so historically and consistent with how this BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| works, it is a created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| I have a point of clarification, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Was it not stated earlier that Mr. Clark inherited this land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| So even though it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| something that was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| inappropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| it was not necessarily something that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| It was not something that he was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| It was not something that he was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| It sounds like unknowingly, I'm sure it sounds like maybe his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| family members might not have been aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Is that a true statement that he inherited the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| and inherited this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Are you asking Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Clark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| I can just say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| property assessor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| has Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Bill Clark purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| And so if you look at KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| and the historical aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| many of these structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| appeared after that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| So I don't know exactly if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| he inherited all of them or what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| So based on KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| and the historical aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| the title of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| was able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| the title of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| was possible for the title to change names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| What I can say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| I've been speaking to council as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| non-council member and been a council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| with an understanding of what a hardship is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| And what I am making my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| vote on is not how I feel about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| applicant, who they are, where they came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| I have to look at it and apply it evenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| as I would apply it to any person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| I hear and I think everybody brings up great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I don't think it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| demolished and that wasn't mentioned in any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| It's the next person and the next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| and the next person across our city are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| depending on us to interpret the laws we have on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| books evenly and the same and consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| And that's why my motion is based as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| ≫ Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3171)|

| 0:52:57| on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Context matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| when we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| make what we think is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| good law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| understand the full context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And maybe we even apply our own context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| to their context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| And so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| In this situation, I did have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| and another question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3222)|

| 0:53:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| the created hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| is that just a blanket definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Is there any context there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Like in terms of if the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| have been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| I'm curious about how it's been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| And if there have been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3258)|

| 0:54:36| the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| The answer would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| They have not recognized the longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| of an illegal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3285)|

| 0:55:03| ≫ Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| their definition of a self-created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| hardship, it's simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| if the structure exists before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| variance is created, then it's self-created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| ≫ They would look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I would word it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| If I were to go and build something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| and I recognize that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| sinkhole in my backyard and I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| to move this structure closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| property line to stay away from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| sinkhole, they have absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I can remember a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| where there was a structure that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| seeking a side yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| The structure just showed up without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| We got a complaint about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| We followed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| They went to the board and they provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| They said we have a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| We had to shift the structure to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| So it seems like this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| actually doesn't fit into the self-created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| hardship definition because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| applicant did not build the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| ≫ Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| ≫ Maybe Mr. Swanson has a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3405)|

| 0:56:54| definition of hardship, what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| law requires is that the hardship be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| related to the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3420)|

| 0:57:18| natural condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| definition that's been around for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3444)|

| 0:57:48| ≫ Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Testament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| ≫ Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| So I'm a little confused now just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| based on what Director Aaron said and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| I'm looking for some chronology here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| So we've heard 50 years and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| the title transferred in 1981 and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| those structures were then built post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| So that timeline isn't, so did Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Clark build those structures or were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| they already existing when he assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| the title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| ≫ Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| Bader, do you have an answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| ≫ No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| ≫ Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Carl, about the timeline question from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| Councilmember Testament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| ≫ Well, it appears from looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| KGIS aerials, the historical aerials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| that if you look at 2007, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| difference and a structure added in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| And then you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| 2007 aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| structures were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| So my question to relate to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| Clark purchased this property or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| became titled in his name in 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| So based on what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| looking at, it's pretty straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| to deduce that these structures were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| built by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Clark or someone came and built them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| his land, maybe someone else paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| them, but based on the records that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| have, there were no permits for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| And we're being asked to grant a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| variance for the amount of coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| So that's my question to relate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| KGIS aerial 2003 to 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| ≫ Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| ≫ Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3615)|

| 1:00:21| It seems like if we deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| variances, the structures are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3624)|

| 1:02:01| And making it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| some sort of no-fault claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| within there that allows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3733)|

| 1:02:28| be for this body to be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Is there a state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| ≫ I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| I didn't mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I guess technically the process would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| be to create an amended ordinance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| a limited ability to depart from state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| law with regard to what may be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| as an appropriate variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| So we would have to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| investigating and some legal research as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| to whether we could bring an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| that is an ordinance, as you suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| that provides some level of forgiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| either after a period of time or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So we would have to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| I hope we're not going to pass an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| ordinance that permits illegal uses no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3802)|

| 1:04:04| has to keep those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=3844)|

| 1:18:40| Board, and I hope you will support this resolution. Any questions or comments? Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| I just wanted to say just kind of in reading this, and I know this is one of the first pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| that Council has received, especially new Council. My understanding is that Council over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4735)|
| 1:19:04| or at least these Council Members, have never really done a workshop on pilots and TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| and so I was going to ask Vice Mayor McKenzie and propose to see if we could consider doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| workshop on pilots and TIFs to better understand as they come our way, because they can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| be complicated issues, but I just wanted to propose that while we're discussing. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Testerman and Vice Mayor McKenzie. Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Yeah, I was wondering if Deputy Director Welch or if Ms. Foster was on the call and could maybe give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| us a little bit of detail about this pilot is a little different than anything that's been before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| Council while I've been on Council, and specifically of interest to me is the callback schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| which is also different, so if they could speak to that for us, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| Ms. Welch, could you address this question from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Ryder. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| Great. Thanks. So, thank you for the question, Councilwoman Ryder, and also, I know that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| had an opportunity to go out and visit the site, so thanks for your engagement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| So, this is a little bit different from the development-style pilots that this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| has seen before. This is a jobs pilot or an economic development pilot. This company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| as the Mayor indicated, already has a presence in our community. They've been working with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| Chamber for the last little bit of time, and I'm thankful Doug Lawyer is on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| as is Todd Napier and Mr. White from Fraley and Schilling. They were interested in this expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| not just of their facility, but I think what's of greatest interest to us is that they are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| interested in adding over 100 really high-quality jobs, and that doesn't only benefit those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4864)|
| 1:21:12| individuals who are, you know, who get those jobs, but that's a big benefit to our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4872)|
| 1:21:20| So, there's a return on investment to the individual and to the overall community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| So, those are some of the factors that we looked at as a city in working with the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| and with the City IDB in evaluating this. As you indicated, Councilman Ryder, there is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| an accountability factor here that I think is really important. So, as the City IDB moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4899)|
| 1:21:48| with the agreement with Fraley and Schilling, there will be a clawback provision that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| not only the number of jobs, and if they don't hit the mark on the number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| then the tax abatement is scaled back, but also on the wages. So, again, it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| to us. I know it is to you on Council and to Fraley and Schilling that these are high-quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| jobs and that that average salary and wage is not just competitive, but that it actually exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4932)|
| 1:22:20| both the median household income and per capita income in our community, which I think says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4940)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Ms. Welch. Any further questions or comments? And just as a side note, of course, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| eager to help, you know, whatever you all want on a workshop on pilots and TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| as Councilmember Testerman was suggesting. I think that's a great idea. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Vice Mayor McKenzie and I can work on finding a time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| finding a time that works for Council to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Councilmember Singh. Thank you. Deputy Mayor Welch, would you mind repeating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| you had said it's not just a benefit to the people getting the jobs, but also to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| Could you repeat that part, what it's doing there? Sure. I mean, as we have new high-quality jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| come into our community, yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Singh. I mean, that is an infusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| of dollars into our community with these, you know, really quality wages, in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5000)|
| 1:23:29| capital commitment that they're making through building out their facility, which will generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| additional tax revenue for the City of Knoxville and for Knox County. So, we see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| a couple of different things. And then I'll just add that I'm really grateful for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| the Chamber leading the way with a strategy. You've heard about Path to Prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| which is focused on strengthening and growing our economic ecosystem. So, by retaining and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| expanding their business, it is an investment in our community, and it builds on the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| strength that we have around mobility and transportation logistics. So, we see it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| a community win and as a win to the individuals who will be gaining some really good employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5054)|
| 1:24:21| And then there were also some differences on the pilot. It's not a 100 percent. It was 60-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5061)|
| 1:24:30| Could you talk about that? Correct. And yes, you know, thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| Good question. And I'll lean on Todd Napier here as well, who helped us run that through a formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5075)|
| 1:24:43| so that we, you know, really understand the, you know, the best ratio to use with that pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| So, unlike previous pilots that you've seen on Council, which are focused, again, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| building and development, which typically are at a 100 percent tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| we were able to look at this through, you know, a 60 percent tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| which basically means that as soon as the property is reassessed, the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| both will begin receiving a higher number of tax dollars on this property. They will pay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| 40 percent of the reassessed new tax amount that will be due on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5123)|
| 1:25:32| I think this is the first pilot that we've had on Council this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| And I do appreciate the negotiations that were put into it. I do want to make a request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| the next pilots or TIFs that come up, I'd like, I know for myself, and I'm sure other Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| members would like to see it as soon as possible so that it can be something that's discussed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| the neighbors in the community as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| Heard that, and we'll try to follow up and get it to you sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| Councilor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Yes, a question for the Chamber. Just want to ensure that all avenues will be exhausted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| make sure that this, that the job opportunities are listed, the organizations that will meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| the needs and especially touch minority, the minority community. So if you could maybe confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| that or just talk a little bit about what that strategy is, if you have that already plotted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| Sure thing. And this is Doug Lawyer with the Knoxville Chamber. Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Okay. Yeah. So typically what we do with any, whether it's a retention expansion project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| like we're talking here, or a new business attraction project, we will work closely with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| Fraley and Schilling to make sure that they register all of these available jobs with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| with the State's Department of Labor, the American Job Center is, is a strong partner of ours. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| will also help to push that information out to various groups such as the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| Centro Hispano, whichever, all these partner agencies that the Chamber works with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| And then to help get that word out. Another point about this project that's really exciting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5235)|
| 1:27:25| Fraley and Schilling already has partnerships with the University of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| logistics school. The Tennessee College of Applied Technology also is doing truck driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| training. So that's, that's another connection that we will work to establish and strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| with this expansion here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Thank you, Mr. Lawyer. Any, Mr. Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Yeah. Obviously, we need to scrutinize each pilot as they come before us. One thing that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| impresses me about this one is there's not 100% abatement from the get go. I mean, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| get a 40% increase on taxes from that property immediately, and then a promise of greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| returns later. So I'm particularly impressed with the way this one is structured. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas. Councilmember Roger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| I was just wondering, I believe, is there someone on the call from Fraley and Schilling that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| give us a little bit of information about your business, who you are? And I know I had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5303)|
| 1:28:32| opportunity to meet with you. This is out on Straw Flames in the 4th District. But others might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| like to hear a little bit about you guys and also the different types of jobs that are there at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| location and to be added. Okay, thank you. I think someone's on the line from the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| from Fraley and Schilling. I'm not sure who to recognize, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| They could raise their hand. Andy White is the CFO with Fraley and Schilling. This is Doug with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| the Chamber, but I believe Andy is on the phone. Mr. White, Andy White, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5345)|
| 1:29:15| Okay. Mayor, I'll enable him to speak. He needs to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Hello. Yes, can you? Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| You can just start by stating your name and address just so we all know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| I'm Andy White, and I'm the CFO. I'm located at 1920 South State Road 3 in Rushfield, Indiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5365)|
| 1:29:34| at our headquarters currently. Give you a little bit of a background about Fraley and Schilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| It was started in 1955. It had mainly a presence across I-70 for the first 25, 30 years. But in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5380)|
| 1:29:51| 1990, it started a program of innovation and sustainability leadership in the carrier industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5391)|
| 1:30:01| We have developed, by working with tractor manufacturers and trailer manufacturers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| the ability to make lighter, safer, and more ergonomic equipment that is safer and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| fuel-efficient and hauls. Everybody has an 80,000-pound limit without permits, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| we can haul substantially more than our competitors in all kinds of trailers that we are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| We also use 10 tires instead of 18 tires, a little different design on them, so there's less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| tire manufacturing. But we've brought that sustainability and innovation leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| And after 2008 and 2009, it really expanded, which is where we started doing business in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| We bought a piece of property in Alcoa, and we started with two employees, and we grew to about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5454)|

| 1:33:04| at our saddle rack location now, so we do need to expand. And, you know, the economy, the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5584)|
| 1:33:13| we work with, the ability to hire high quality individuals has been something that is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| attractive to us in the Knoxville area. Any other questions? I'm glad to answer them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5599)|
| 1:33:28| I just one last thing I wanted you to note, Mr. White, my understanding this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5608)|

| 1:33:40| but family-owned. Yeah, it certainly started as just, you know, Robert Schilling, who lives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5620)|

| 1:35:48| able to get this out sooner so we could have co-sponsors. This is one where we had to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| with a lot of different groups in order to get this in front of us. And the idea was we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| to get it in front of Council as quickly as we could. And it is on emergency, so we'll only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| to handle it once. Basically, what we have is there's temporary permits right now that allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5765)|
| 1:36:13| a restaurant to expand its table service space outside of the regular confines of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| establishment. They have to get a permit for that first. We've got two of them, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| just one of them came today that is allowing that in Market Square. This would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| for restaurants anywhere, but they have to get that temporary permit first. What we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| allowing in this amendment is allowing those same spaces to then serve beer. And hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| by doing that, we're taking some proactive measures to help our small businesses, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| restaurants, and, you know, keep them operating. And then also keeping their employees employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| during these difficult times. So I hope you can forgive the not getting this on the agenda as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| quickly as we could have for co-sponsorship, but I hope you can join in supporting this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5821)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you, Council Member Roberto. And thank you for working on this. I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| great idea. Any further comments or questions? Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5836)|

| 1:37:33| Being on emergency, we won't have to have two readings of it. So we'll have it done in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| for us to vote on the next beer board meeting to have the forms ready for people to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| So the idea is to get this option out to as many restaurants as possible as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5865)|
| 1:37:56| Thank you, Mr. Roberto. Mr. Thomas? Yeah, I just had a question for clarification. Does this apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| only to restaurants that I believe have to serve up to 50% of their income from food? Or does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5882)|
| 1:38:10| apply to bars as well where they can do outside seating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Really good question. This is only applying to restaurants. And it only applies temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| during the emergency declaration. So after the emergency declaration is no longer in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| neither would this. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| Okay. Any further questions or comments? This requires six votes to pass to be read on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=5917)|

| 1:41:27| the moratorium several times, even before this Council. I think we instituted it. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6087)|

| 1:41:57| the agenda right now and what purpose it serves. Yeah, absolutely. To Council Member Ryder's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6117)|
| 1:42:06| back in February of this year, Council voted to approve to extend the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| on shared mobility vehicles, which, for all intents and purposes, right now are electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| scooters. That was extended through September 2nd of this year, and with that coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6137)|
| 1:42:25| we are looking to extend that moratorium again until June 30th. The ultimate goal of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6145)|
| 1:42:32| is not just to keep renewing and extending moratoriums, but to come up with a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| policy or set of policies to bring before Council for you all to possibly approve that would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6158)|

| 1:52:29| much greater densities under the previous zoning ordinance. So based on planning staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| and as recommended by the Planning Commission, the development is considered appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6755)|

| 1:53:26| a soft or moderate-density residential in these neighborhoods that are typically characterized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6806)|
| 1:53:33| by the one- and two-family homes because it does not allow the large-scale multifamily units found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| in R and 4 and R and 5 and above. So the triplex-style dwellings may be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6819)|
| 1:53:46| They do require a special use approval, and they do include dimensional standards that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| compatible with other districts such as the R and 1 and R and 2 that are found in low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| districts. So these include restrictions on height, building coverage, and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| And to answer your second question, Councilmember Smith, so the reason for the sector plan in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| year plan amendment is that the Laney's classification table was changed by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| back in April of this year. So I'm moving that R and 3 district from low-density residential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6853)|
| 1:54:23| what is called medium-density residential. And prior to that change, the R and 3 would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| been included in low-density residential and wouldn't have required these plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| So the rezoning would have still required the three publicly noticed meetings, just as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| now, but there would just be one agenda item at each of these meetings. So there would only be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| rezoning. So with the change of that Laney's classification table, the rezoning now requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| these two plan amendments, and the property can't be rezoned without these changes. And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| if the administration wants to weigh in regarding Laney's classification table and maybe some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| broader implications of those changes that were made earlier this year. I would defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you, Ms. Brooks. I had a question. I just wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| clarify that item I, J, and K. I know we're talking about just I now. They're all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| They're all related, I, J, and K. And would this development be something that contributes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6918)|
| 1:55:27| so-called missing middle of housing? That's a triplex, you said. The missing middle is what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| lot of housing advocates call it. Is that a fair characterization? I think that's a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6934)|
| 1:55:41| characterization. In particular, that RN3 and RN4, that was the intent behind introducing those zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| into the new zoning ordinance was to allow those different types of housing. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| Stephanie Welch, did you have anything you wanted to add to clarify if you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| Yes. Thank you, Mayor. And I'll just make this really quick because I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| you know, I know Council wants to kind of stick to the issue on the table. But I think what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| Brooks just outlined flags for us that the Land Use Classification Table is something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6970)|
| 1:56:17| will be bringing back to Council to revisit. I think that Planning Commission has that on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6977)|

| 1:56:32| Council at a later date. That is not the question tonight. We feel like this is a legal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| appropriate use of the land. It's compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| we are, from an administration standpoint, very supportive of Planning's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7003)|

| 2:03:11| Councilmember Singh, seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| Is Mr. Loven here today? Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| Mr. Loven, if you'd like to speak to that, because it is, it's interesting and unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| Okay. Mr. Loven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| could you start just by stating your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| My name is Wade Loven with MBI Companies at 299 Northwest Garber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7415)|
| 2:03:44| Okay. Go ahead and tell us a little bit about this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| Okay. The ultimate goal at the end of this is to build a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7428)|
| 2:03:57| And so that's typically a pretty controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| item. And the owners and my clients are asking to put this in the middle of a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7441)|
| 2:04:09| And to me, it makes perfect sense. And so what we did was we subdivided the property to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7449)|
| 2:04:18| conformity with the zoning. We asked for a rezoning to be able to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7458)|
| 2:04:29| The distances from the property lines are greater than double the required distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7469)|
| 2:04:37| And so we feel like it's a perfect location for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| Thank you, Mr. Loven. Any questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200811?start=7482)|
