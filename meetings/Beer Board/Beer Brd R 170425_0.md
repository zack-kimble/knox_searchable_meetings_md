| 0:01:56| Ernie Brooks, 967 Irwin Street is the club address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Okay, and you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| My name is Kristen Bridgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| At the Pinnacle at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Would you like our address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| 11251 Parkside Drive, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Sergeant Coward, is the record check complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| We're missing fingerprints, background check, and task class requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| So, my plan was to attend that last Thursday, and we had, everyone from our office was gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| so I had to stay and cover our office details, so my plan is to complete that this Thursday before our event takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| Well, that's a nice plan, but the rules of the beer board are that you must have the records check complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=162)|
| 0:02:51| or we cannot approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| So, because you have not completed the records check, background check, by this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| I think your events will be over before we have another meeting on May the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| So, typically what people do when they find themselves in this situation is that they get a caterer who is licensed by TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| and they can handle the beer pouring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| That's what we did last year. We were trying to not pay those fees to them, but we can do that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Okay, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And let me suggest that next year, when you even think about having this kind of an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| that you go ahead and get that done so that you don't get caught at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Sure, I completely understand. We were a little pressed for time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| I do have one question for you before we wrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| This event is one event, but it takes place over the course of four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| So, there was a little confusion whether this permit would cover those four weeks or only the first three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| since it's one total event. Can you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Well, you asked for the Sounds of Spring Concerts May the 4th, 11th, and 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| Those were the dates that you put on the application. What's the fourth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| The 25th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Okay. That's not on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| It was on the application, and when I went in to speak with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| it was removed because they said it would not be able to be granted, and I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| Okay. Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| With the size of the agenda and not having my book open to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| maybe you could call me tomorrow at my office so we can get back to those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you, Mr. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| So let me get this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| You're going to hire a caterer who has a beer permit to handle the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| We are actually working with Calhoun's on this, and they said if we needed, we could use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| So do I have a motion to approve pending use of a permitted caterer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| You won't need a permit, I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We didn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| We really did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| You just went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Next is Breeze and Go on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Breeze and Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Damien Lamb, 5708 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Sergeant Coward, is the record check complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Yes, no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| And the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Just make a note that there was a previous permit that was revoked from this location on April 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| We always like people who have everything in and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| I'm sorry, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| So say that again about the revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| Yes, there was a revocation April 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| The previous owner's permit was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Not this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Not this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| It was somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| But doesn't the revocation follow the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Just the operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| It does follow the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| It does for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| All right. So now what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| The Veer Board has it in its discretion to waive that, and it's done on occasion in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=381)|
| 0:06:30| Was the revocation for what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| If I recall correctly, the previous owner closed and didn't turn in their Veer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| All right. That happens frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Would it be the pleasure of the Veer Board to go ahead and allow this person to have the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Are you a totally separate entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Okay. So this person that had it before is not part of your team or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| All right. I would move that we go ahead and allow the permitting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| Okay. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| All right. Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Just as a note, next month there will be about four or five of these revocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| because of people going out of business and not thinking they need to turn in a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Well, I mean, I hate to split hairs here, but wouldn't we, Ms. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| have to remove the prohibition on the property and then in a separate action approve the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| Well, I would submit that, you know, the Veer Board has knowledge of the one-year issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| and has voted to approve the next person, so it's almost a de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Okay. No problem. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Next is Central Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=472)|
| 0:08:04| Statement of address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Wendell Hall, 7045 Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I'm counsel for Central Depot, Dan Weld, LLC, which will be doing business at Central Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| Okay. Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| We need the fire prevention building inspection and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Okay. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Move to approve, append and file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| All right. Can you just, in 30 seconds, tell us what Central Depot is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Basically a restaurant bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Three seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Good food and good drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Okay. Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| As soon as those inspections are done, you can pick up the permit at the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| I want 10 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| All right. Next is the Clarion Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=527)|

| 0:23:32| Some of the climbs, you may want to have a beer before you do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1416)|

| 0:24:06| We need building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1446)|

| 0:24:09| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Do we know what this was before it became Why Knot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| It was Toot's Little Honky Tonk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Okay, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Several of us have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Visited there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Yes. Were you with Toot's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| No, I wasn't with her, but Why Knot's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| That's good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| We have one more item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And this is a resolution to approve updates to the beer permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| and then we'll come back and do the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| And those updates are basically Mr. Frost, do you want to fill us in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| From our beer board workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| it sounded like there was the clear desire of counsel for irregular on-premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| those types of permits that the people have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| the applicants have to submit their plan for server compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| like people have to do for special event permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| So that's one addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| And the second addition is contingent upon counsel passing on second reading tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| the self-serve beer ordinance to add that to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| It didn't make much sense, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| to wait until the ordinance got approved for second reading tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| to be back here in 30 days to approve a slightly modified permit form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| So we're going to get it all done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Does this happen at council or here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Actually, the ordinances say the changes to the beer permit are taken care of by a resolution at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| So we've had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| And I believe that we're ready to go with those changes, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| We are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| We have two businesses that have been with us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| and one of them since December 6th, the Cedar Lane Sitco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| and they wanted a 30-day extension to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Is the Cedar Lane Sitco here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1587)|

| 0:26:52| So we're basically just waiting for the inspections and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I'm really sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| We have a contractor with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| They would explain how long it would still take, but hopefully just a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170425?start=1627)|
