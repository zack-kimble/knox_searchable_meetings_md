| 0:05:06| Also, Mr. Chairman, if it would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| I'd like to add to our agenda today that we recommend to the full commission that we add Mr. Wright to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| The 8th District needs to be represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And since we will not have a representative until the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| I just feel that we need to make that recommendation to the full commission that Mr. Wright be added to the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| if that is acceptable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| That would be acceptable to me until someone is elected and installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| But I would roll off the beer board in favor of whoever is elected because I am on CZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| So if we could do that for the next month or so to have him as a recommendation to the full commission and have them vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| So I'd like to add that to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Mr. Law Director, do you see a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| We need to take a vote on that and pass it as a recommendation from the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| That would be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=359)|

| 0:14:02| So you're saying then that the lack of posting was not the fault of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| but essentially you found there was no appropriate place to post?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Well, there's not even a building up there, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| It's a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| The house has got to be tore down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I'm figuring they're probably not even going to start for how many, Ken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| If I may, we have another piece of land that this is going to adjoin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| The land that we're purchasing is going to adjoin this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| and so the other partial land that has been there is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| The fact that it's within proximity of a church is not a legal basis for denying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| It's simply because our code reads as to on-premises only, not off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| And I'm not, nor is this Board, I think, in any possession of any information that there's been a valid objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=891)|
| 0:14:59| This being the case, members of the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| I don't see where there is an issue regarding posting as to that can be imparted to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=902)|
| 0:15:12| Anything further, Mr. Minot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Sending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Any of the Board members have any questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| I'll make a motion that we go ahead and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Yes, I ask Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Codes, did you have a chance to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| There's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I'd like to second, but also I'd like to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| we could use something similar to an MPC sign in the future if it's a vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| or that there's going to be a posting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I think it would be more efficient to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Do we have anything like that, UK, that we could use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| All the clerk's office gives me and I put them on the doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| The glass is the agenda that are coming before the Veer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| We could do something like what MPC does and make it out of black so nobody will steal it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| and do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| It's been first and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=969)|

| 0:18:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| This application you're making, is it for on premises, on and off premises, or off premises sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| Premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1109)|

| 0:18:40| Juan Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1120)|

| 0:18:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| So at this point you're purchasing this property, you're in the process of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Where are we in the purchase situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| How far along is this purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Closing next week, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| My concern, Mr. Chairman, is he's making an application for a piece of property he doesn't currently own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| We might need to postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I would suggest that, sir, because quite frankly it would be subject to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| It would both expose the board and the applicant to make application for that which he doesn't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| It's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Do you understand what I'm saying, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| By continuing this, is this going to cause you any undue hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| What was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| By continuing this to another date, is that going to in any way interfere with your business plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| We're actually thinking about closing next week, and we've got all the paperwork and everything ready for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| But, Mr. Chairman, I'm thinking that if he doesn't currently own the property, if that's exposing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| then I think that even though it's only a couple more weeks, if you're going to be closing in the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| so I would make a motion that we defer this until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Is there a second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1209)|

| 0:20:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Sir, if you'll just come back next month, let's make sure that you actually own the piece of property and it shouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1222)|

| 0:22:39| No problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| We have some problems with this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| We have had numerous calls for service at that location from stolen vehicles to public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:58| I've got an officer here to testify that Ms. Beatty was present when we confiscated some video poker machines at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:07| I'll let him speak to Officer Sergeant Alan May speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| Sergeant, if you would speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| Alan Wolfie May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| October 3rd, 2007, we confiscated three video poker machines, a couple stamp machines at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:36| It was called Booze and Tunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| These are illegal gambling machines that are illegal to possess in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Ms. Beatty came to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Her son actually ran the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| He was not present, but she came to the scene and she advised me that the machines had been grandfathered in and that they were perfectly legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| And if I took them, I would have to deal with her attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| We had had several complaints from the community about the illegal machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| And like I said, we confiscated three video pokers and two stamp machines on October of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:24| I'll defer to Lieutenant Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| And on July 14th, 08, he can tell you a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| Lieutenant Henderson with Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| On July 14th, we did a controlled buy out of Booze and Tunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| Ms. Beatty was present then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Controlled buy of what? Drugs, alcohol, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| Cocaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| And then again, on July 14th of 08, we bought more cocaine out of that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:03| And on July 18th, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And she was present there at all times when we bought those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| What was the last date you gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| July 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| July 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| You bought more cocaine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Lieutenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Do we have any indictments in that, or where were we at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| We executed a search warrant off of those buys, and her son was arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| And that's when he gave up his license that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| That's still in the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| He has not been charged with the buys that we bought from him as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| But all of those buys were recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| And you may not be able to offer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Was it at the bar in the establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Yes, sir, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| While somebody else was serving alcohol, they were also facilitating this buy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Mr. Chairman, a question, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| You mentioned booze and tunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| How is this related to Pee Wee's and Redline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| It's the same bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So they just changed names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| They just changed the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion we deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Is it the same individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Well, the son previously held the beer permit, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1597)|

| 0:29:21| I pray that you will have contributions to that selection and whoever it may be, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| that will look for you for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1766)|

| 0:29:37| a better place to live because in your name we do pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1780)|

| 0:30:16| If there are no objections, I would like to move 113 up to the beginning where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| go ahead and do the nomination for Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Seeing no objections, that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| Before we get started, I'd like for the clerk to read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:48| Dear Commissioner Strickland, please accept this letter as my notice of withdrawal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| consideration of appointment of the General Sessions Judge Division III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| At the end of last week, I talked with other members of my law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| I always knew that leaving a demanding practice on such short notice for a two-year appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| as judge would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| In the end, it was not entirely fair for my firm or clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| I want to sincerely express appreciation to all the members of the County Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| conducting a thorough public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I trust that those commissioners who express support for me will closely examine other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| candidates and make a wise choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| It's an important decision to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Sincerely, Chad B. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| Commissioner Strickland, my name is Patty Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| I live at 3037 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I would like to say two important things first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Mr. McKenzie has a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Paul Pinkston has a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I put a copy on Mr. Briggs' chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| These are pages that were taken out of context from a hearing in Chancellor Weaver's court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| This was when John Owens was on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| These are just some of the reasons why he should not be in any public office, much less a judge yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| These things are going to be passed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| You can see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| They just jump out at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I hope that if anybody is considering voting for him, that they will read that before they do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| The other thing I'd like to say to the public that's watching on TV, I only found this out this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| This is something that I would think that Mike Harmon would have taken the opportunity to, since he's in the position that he's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:45| like every Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday, whatever morning, write immediately following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Welcome to this brand new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| This day's never been lived before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| It's a blank canvas, if you will it so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| It can be your masterpiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| And then, immediately, he ought to go into, and you can see any, on ctv.org, click on the old meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:12| And you can see any commission meeting that you want to see from whenever for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| People can do this from their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So many people don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| And I'm sure that it was run on Channel 10 at least one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, Patty, but, Mr. Chairman, I don't believe that that's Mike Kamen's duty to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:39| It's not his duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| He can make his decisions in his private life of what he thinks is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| And, you know, if he feels like that's appropriate, then I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| If he doesn't feel that's appropriate, then I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I think those are his private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| That's his private decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| And I don't think that's, I don't, ma'am, I don't think that this is the place to discuss that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| If you think that you would like to discuss with him privately, then you're welcome to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Mr. Lupo, I am not discussing anything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Ma'am, we're not going to have a discussion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I'm simply telling people that are watching on TV that they can go to ctv.org slash old meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| and see how their county commissioners have voted in the past and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| I need your name and address for the record, too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Patty, P-A-T-T-I, Walker, W-A-L-K-E-R, 3037 Tipton Station Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2078)|

| 0:35:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| We'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| In the process to the ones that are new, everyone or anyone can nominate someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| We'll take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| The least amount of votes will drop off and then we'll continue on until we have ten votes for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| It takes ten to get the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2168)|

| 0:36:14| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Well, I'm sure it's no secret everyone's looking at me that I'm going to nominate one of my best friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| but that's not the reason I'm nominating him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I'm nominating him because he has the temperament to be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| His fellow city council people thought he was the best choice three times in nominating him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| and made him their vice mayor unanimously three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| He is the most qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| He's practiced 15 years in all sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| He's served as a special judge in all general sessions criminal and civil division courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| and he's served as a hearing officer for the civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| merit board, and on the hearing panels with the board of professional responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| and the board of medical examiners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| This is why I'm supporting Mark Brown, and I put his name into nomination for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2239)|

| 0:38:07| I'd like to nominate Glenna Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Mr. Chairman, would it be appropriate to comment on a previous nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Being involved in law enforcement for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I kind of know a little bit about general sessions court and the importance that it holds in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| and every county that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| We have a lot of qualified candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| and we have a lot of people that know a lot about a lot of the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| But there's, in my opinion, only one person that has public defender, district attorney, private practice, civil, and criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:59| And that's why I support Patricia Long for this nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| because I know that she has worked hard in all of her facets of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| And I think that having that, I feel that she's the only one that has all the credentials, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| with public defender, district attorney, and private practice, and civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| The criminal docket makes up 80% to 85% of general sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| and she has that well in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| And also the previous civil practice that she has taken on will give her learning curve much shorter time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:36| And that's why I'm nominating Ms. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Yeah, I just want to say a couple of words about Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| I have watched him for a number of years on the city council, and I think he has done a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| I think his experience speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| He has by far the most diverse experience, having been in private practice, both in criminal and civil issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:08| His experience on city council and his experience as a sitting special judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| I think make him overwhelmingly the most qualified person for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| And I just hope that folks will vote their conscience and vote for the best man for the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| and not let things like race and partisan politics get in the way from their voting for by far the most qualified person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| And that person is Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2441)|

| 0:40:50| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We have four nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Is there anyone from the audience who would like to nominate someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| Make a motion to nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Make a motion to nominate and cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2466)|

| 0:41:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Would the commission want to hear from the candidates again or do you want to be ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I think everyone is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2479)|

| 0:41:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Randall Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Before I vote, I'd like to say that this has probably been one of the hardest challenges that I've had on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Got a lot of friends on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| I think we've got a lot of good qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| But I hope that people, when you make the decision, that you look from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And when you vote, you do make the decision from your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And that's not necessarily because it's somebody that you like or dislike, but I'm going to vote for Tricia Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:07| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2531)|

| 0:42:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I want to make a comment right now also, and I want to echo what Commissioner Harmon just said about it being a very difficult decision that I considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| And I told all the candidates, I believe I talked to each of them individually except for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| and I told them I wanted to keep as many names out there as possible as we went through the rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| But just like Commissioner Harmon said, is that you have to really go back and try to put everything aside as far as politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| You have to really look at the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| And I think there's one individual that does stand out against an excellent field, and that's Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| And so I'm casting my vote for Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=2586)|

| 0:51:22| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add to the agenda. I didn't see it and perhaps I overlooked it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| but the school superintendent is making a request for additional funds for security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| and I did not see that on the agenda, but I'd like to have that added. And also I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| like to ask that Resolution 901 and the ordinance that refers to that as well. Pardon me, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| says it's Resolution 806, so it's already on there. I apologize for missing that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| I'd like to ask that Resolution 901 and that the ordinance be deferred for 30 days. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| are several counties that are looking at this litigation fee and a question has arisen as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| to how the money can be spent. The law director is looking at it. CTAS attorneys are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| at it. We want to make sure that what we pass is correct. And as I said, several counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| are looking at this and we should have a clarification of it with the state law and the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| intent by next meeting. So I would ask that this be deferred to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| Resolution 901 and ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3141)|

| 0:53:23| Mr. Luthold would like to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| 102? You want to take it off of consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3206)|

| 0:54:07| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to pull off 701 off consent. Also, I'd like to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| everything that's to be added, withdraw everything that is to be withdrawn, and also withdraw 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3255)|

| 0:54:55| Question, Mr. Chair. Question, Mr. Chair. On 904, if we withdraw it, I guess maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:04| question to the Law Director, can people, entities, potentially bring that back in 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| days? And then if that answer is yes, then if we deny it, can we make it go away forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:24| You can't make it go away forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Oh, and I thought that's what you were going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| But if it's withdrawn, it can be brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| If we deny it, then what? Can they bring it back next month, then, theoretically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| Not next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| It's 90 days. Any item that we've considered, took consideration on, it's 90 days. Only by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3340)|

| 1:02:54| In approving these on consent, particularly the 804 on the South High property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| does that mean we're accepting the conditions that were given to us today on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| But not that addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| No, not not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| That was a handout, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Not what the gentleman asked for, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3794)|

| 1:03:37| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| On election appointments 110, there were two people nominated there in finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| Kenneth Gresham, and his name has been left off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:57| What was the guy's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Kenneth Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Would you like to come up and speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Mr. Commissioner, I believe the reason this resolution is worded as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| is Mr. Gresham was appointed in 07, so his term is still running and unexpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:25| State your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| My name is Nick Arning, 1205 Walnut Branch Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| I'm the Chairman of the Historic Zoning Commission for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| We have now split into Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Mr. Gresham is the Chairman of the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| And yes, sir, you are right, he was approved for reappointment back in 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| It was March 1st, I believe, 2007 that his prior term expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:54| And we were under the impression he was reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| And it was only last week when I found out that he was not appointed or reappointed by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| And so that's why he was on the agenda for the subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| And that's why I spoke last time in requesting that since it was a year ago that he be reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| and Mr. Cottom as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| So if he doesn't need to be reappointed because he's on there as of 2007, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| That serves the same purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| He was reappointed in 07 by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| In March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| That's Resolution 111, 7311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you, Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| It just came back up and I was concerned that somehow it slipped through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| We do not need to vote on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Now you realize that we've appointed people here that have been helped more than twice on these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| You're going to bring us different names the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I've already spoken as of last Thursday with our commissioners to explain that new procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=3972)|

| 1:07:17| I thought what we approved was that going forward there was a two-term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4037)|

| 1:07:35| they have two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| So if Mr. Cobham is on his maybe third term, he still will have another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| So I just want to make sure that that's how we understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| 1-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| appointing to the Knox County Audit Committee for years' terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| 10-0 to approve the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Commissioner Hamlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| As you know, the commission voted to expand the audit committee with the oversight of Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and Mr. Walls is all in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| And so the state comptroller's office had set up the design for this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| As you know, two outside people are to be appointed to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Mr. Walls has been in contact with two professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| One of those professional organizations recommended three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| The finance committee looked at the resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Joseph Carcello, I'm not familiar with any of these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| He had quite an impressive resume, and the fact he's willing to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| we felt that he should be given the appointment from this one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I believe, Mr. Walls, you're waiting on names from the second organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| But we also need to pick three commissioners to be on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| I'm just going to throw out a recommendation for your consideration that our finance chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| Mr. Pinkston, be on this committee, also Commissioner Shouse and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:07| I'd like to withdraw my name from that and put the vice chair, Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| And I would also like to withdraw mine and enter the name Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| Why don't you withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| What have you got against Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| And who are the names again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| I said it would be Commissioners Wright, Commissioner Shouse, Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| I can definitely go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| So I will make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Okay, what about the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| I would add Carcello to that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| and we will await Mr. Walls getting the names from the other professional organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| and we'll have that hopefully next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| We'll take care of it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Everyone clear on the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| I'd be honored to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| We'll be pretty heavy from the fourth district there, but I'd be honored to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| So I guess y'all are kind of heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Y'all are both numbers men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| So are we clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Do you have something, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Mr. Chairman, could we move as quick as we could for the Teague family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| They've just had a very bad week last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| If everyone is clear, we can start right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Read 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Memorializing Ralph Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| This is resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Mr. Chairman, if you would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4239)|
| 1:11:05| Mr. Luthold, who served with Mr. Teague, would like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| It was a privilege to have known Ralph Teague for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| and to serve with him his entire tenure on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| He was a good commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| He was a loyal commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| He was a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| And he often spoke about his family, his wife, his son, his brother, his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| They were all very close to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| And so it was an honor and it's very sad of his untimely death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| and extend to the family the condolences of myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| and former commissioners who served with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| because he was a distinguished commissioner for this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| and he served as chairman of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4313)|
| 1:12:03| When I was elected to public office the first time in 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| one of the first commissioners I met was Ralph Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| And he went far and away beyond what he had to do to welcome me to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| to help me become acclimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| He was a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| He was a good friend of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| He truly, truly cared about this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| and he cared deeply about his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| As Commissioner Leuthold mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| he spoke often about his wife and his son and the pride he had for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| It was an honor for me to serve with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| and I can tell you without question that Knox County is a much finer place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| because of his presence in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| and his service on the body of which you now sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| So I want to extend on behalf of Knox County's 400,000 citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| our condolences to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| and thank you for the sacrifices that you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| while your dad was up here serving with us on county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| and representing his community so very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| Mr. Chairman, we have two copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| one for his son, Judd, who lives in Kingsport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| so he can take one home with him and one for his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I'd like to make a motion we pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:55| I'll go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:07| Clerk will read 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Yeah, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| approving the amount designated to close fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| Resolution 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| It's on page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| On a vote, 7-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| You're making that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I'll make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you, and thank you for the opportunity to be here before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I'm the superintendent of schools here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| And as all of you know, on August 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| we had a tragic incident in our community when a student at Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| Ryan McDonald, was fatally shot in the cafeteria just prior to school opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| School shootings are very rare events, not just here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| And all of us have been quite disturbed by this horrific event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| The incident does raise a larger issue of school safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| And since then, obviously, we've been reviewing, carefully analyzing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| all of our safety protocols, procedures, and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| And we do believe that we have a fairly robust safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| and security infrastructure in the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| but we have identified several additional enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| and initiatives that we believe will help us to ensure that we're doing everything that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| to make sure that our kids are safe in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And so before you is a slate of initiatives and potential reforms that will help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| I think, in the short term and in the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| to make sure our schools are even safer than they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| And I can walk you very quickly through just the categories of items that are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| And first and foremost on the list is three additional security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| We would deploy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| We have already deployed an officer in the short term to Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| but we'd like to make that a permanent position for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| And then two other officers, one potentially at Holston Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| and the third that would be a district-wide position that we could use to deploy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| in a variety of different ways, including potentially to allow us to do some random searches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| and things of that nature that will help, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| enhance the safety and security of our students in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| The second through third items on the list are some physical security tools, metal detectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| walk-through metal detectors, video monitoring systems that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| we believe can be useful tools in conjunction with a whole host of other enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| and tools to make sure that our kids are safe and our schools are secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| There's an information incentive program on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and this is one of just many ways that we want to make sure that students are part of the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| in terms of school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And I've talked a lot about the relationships that we believe are important in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| for a variety of reasons, making sure that students are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| making sure that students are engaged in the life of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| and making sure that students are engaged in high-level work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| that's going to make sure that they're successful over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| But also having those relationships is really important to school safety and security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| making sure that there are trusting relationships between kids and adults in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| so that students feel comfortable sharing information or concerns that they might have about school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| And the incentive program is really about, I think, reinforcing that notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| and making sure that students know that they should be doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| and that they'll be rewarded for doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| There's some professional development dollars in this package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| and that's to build on some of the things that we've done already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| in terms of building capacity with our staff around early intervention and around threat assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| so that we can take some of the practices that we have been successful with in some of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| and hopefully extend them out to all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| There's some overtime dollars for a home visit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| We currently do some home visits in conjunction with the security department here in our Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| but also with the Knox County Sheriff's Department and the Knoxville PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| But we really only do it at a crisis stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| We really only do it when it gets to be an extreme situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| And what we'd like to do is to extend that program and enhance that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| so that we can begin to use that as a preventative tool, as an intervention and prevention tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| rather than a response to crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| So that's one of the items that's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| By the way, I also would like to commend our law enforcement partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| Our partnership with both the Knoxville PD and the Sheriff's Office has been outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| Their response to this crisis, but also to the greater concerns and questions and interest in tightening up our security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:15| I think has been outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| And I value that partnership, and it's been a terrific working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| And then finally, there is on the docket, on the proposal, a comprehensive security review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| And I want to emphasize that this would both be an internal and external review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| So it would leverage some of the internal capacity and expertise that we have, which, by the way, is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| We have folks both in our security department and in Knoxville PD and in the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| who have substantial expertise and knowledge about school safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Sergeant Chaney on the Knoxville Police Department actually does some teaching nationally at conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| and things of that nature on school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| So we have some great internal expertise, but I think it's also always useful to bring in some external expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| to give a fresh set of eyes, to provide some additional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| And so there's some dollars in here to allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| And that's really, again, I think an additional starting point for the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| This isn't the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| This isn't the panacea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| This is really the beginning of an additional conversation, the beginning of a further conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| and an ongoing conversation about how we make sure all of our students are safe and all of our schools are secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| So I appreciate the opportunity to be here before you to talk about the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| and I urge your passage and I look forward to working with the commission in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| I don't think there's any question that we need to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| and we appreciate your bringing these initiatives forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I'm going to vote for it, and I'm sure my colleagues are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| I guess the only question I have is where is the money going to come from, John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| so that we can be clear as to how these funds are going to be brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| What this mirrors is a resolution last month to designate and appropriate funds from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| from the fiscal 2008 budget into the new year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| We wanted to keep the current year as clean as we could, and this way it does facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| and gives this commission an opportunity to honor the school board's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| That was the same question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Commissioner Hammond, where are the monies coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Dr. McIntyre, thank you for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| It's been a rocky start, but you've handled everything really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| I have the utmost respect for you, and you're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I also want to commend Steve Griffin over there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Steve, good job with security and Roy Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| So we're real impressed with what you're doing, and if we can help you, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Schauff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Dr. McIntyre, will you elaborate briefly on the home visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| I see 300 home visits, and I just wondered what with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| and administrators and sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| So the unit of analysis is 300, and that would be 300 essentially overtime hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| and that might be some of the items that are on here require some additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| I think, ability for us to think about the implementation of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| and how exactly it plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| But the concept is that we would have additional overtime hours in order to do some home visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| in conjunction not just with our school security, but also I think they're very powerful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| when you have someone like a school administrator or a teacher that might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| probably not a teacher, but more a school administrator, someone from the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| or the Knoxville PD, perhaps someone from the clergy who can all go together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| and have a conversation with parents and with the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| My experience is the worst case scenario is you learn more about the student's background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| where the student's coming from, the home situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| and gather additional information about the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| The best case scenario is sometimes the parents are learning about the behaviors that are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| for the first time in those conversations and pledge to make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| and a change in how the student interacts in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| So the 300 units would be 300 additional hours rather than 300 additional visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:25| So it could be three hours of overtime a night to do one or two home visits on a Thursday night, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| You have a criteria which would suggest a home visit by clergy or by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| I'm not asking you to go into that in detail, but there's a criteria established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| where that works its way through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| This is a conceptual model at the moment, but we are working with Mr. Griffin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:55| we're going to work with Knoxville PD and with the Sheriff's Office to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| and with our administrators, quite frankly, to decide where these visits might be most effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| I think, again, the shift is really from crisis management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| We do some of these now where a kid's really in crisis and they've done something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| they've exhibited some violent behavior or something of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| and we do it on the back end, and what we'd like to do is do more of it on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| A student gets himself in trouble, he's probably not in that crisis situation yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| he's not down that path yet, but he's exhibited a behavior that we find disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| and we're going to go into the home and have that visit, talk with the parents about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| and make sure that we are on the prevention and intervention mode rather than on the crisis management mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| I've mentioned to you before personally that I really appreciate how you've addressed this board, this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| and how you've reached out to us to try to obviously repair some of the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| between the commission and the school system that have been troublesome in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| And I am indeed sorry that your superintendency has been somewhat marked with these very difficult issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:12| and you have addressed them, and I think we're very pleased with your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| I want to throw you a little bit of a fastball, though, in terms of this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| having been a classroom teacher and experiencing some of the difficulties with students that have real serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:33| behavioral problems, and you partially addressed that just then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| Is there a way that or what personnel in the school system, which personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:48| would it be appropriate to have knowledge of previous criminal background or a pattern of criminal behavior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:59| Is it appropriate for staff or for teachers to have access for information like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:09| And I say that because being in the classroom, I have been exposed myself to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| that had a very dangerous background, unbeknownst to me, until the explosive event occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| And so I think that's an issue that you might address in the future, and it might be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:33| I don't know whether you have any response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Sure, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Part of the response is this is a continuing dialogue and an ongoing conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| and I appreciate the commission's willingness to take some of the short-term measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| and I hope adopt the short-term measures that we hope will put us in good stead in the short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| and hopefully in the long term as well, but there's some additional longer-term measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| that we need to be talking more about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| One of them I mentioned, which is relationships between and among adults and kids in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| and making sure that we have for every student at least one caring adult relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| that manifests itself in that school so that students, the research shows that those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| who have at least one of those types of relationships with the teacher is more engaged in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| more engaged in the life of the school, more successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And by the way, I think the schools are probably safer because of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Alternative education is another area that I think we're going to have to have a longer-term conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and what that looks like and do we have adequate capacity for alternative educational settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| I think that's certainly one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| And I think this is an issue that we'll have to have more discussion about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| What level of information is appropriate for an administrator or a classroom teacher to have about a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| And there's a balance to be struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| There's a balance to be struck between the teacher having appropriate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| and the kid who's maybe engaged in a minor offense having a second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| And there is a state law now that requires the courts and other certain actors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| to provide information to the school, read the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| if serious offenses have been adjudicated for youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| So if a student has been engaged in or convicted of some fairly serious offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| that information is required to be submitted to the school so that the school is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| And there is a lot of discussion about precisely how that information is used in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| The idea is to provide that information to the teachers who come in direct contact with that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| so they're aware of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| So there is some state law that requires that information to be given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| And I think we have to have a lot more discussion about what's the appropriate use of some of that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| and or additional information that may come to us in terms of a student's criminal and or disciplinary record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:59| Well, I appreciate that you are very concerned at doing the best that you all can do with safeguarding students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:10| And I just want to give you, emphasize again, the perspective of an old teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| And it's a tough, tough place, as you well know, in that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| And anything that we can do to ensure those teachers that we are indeed looking out for them as well as the safety of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:31| would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| And as a former teacher myself at an alternative high school in East St. Louis, I appreciate the sentiments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5380)|

| 1:29:52| I need to go back to 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| It brought to my attention that we left off the amount of years for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| You want to say two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5404)|

| 1:30:10| Well, for the commissioners, the term that they remain on commission is until August 31, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:21| Now, if we want to make the non-commissioners a different amount, I think we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| I think two years is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| If you make that a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5428)|

| 1:35:06| I move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Doug Purtell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| I guess this is partly my fault because when we talked at Intergovernmental, we just talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| about taking back over control of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| And then as I read, getting here that we're approving the bylaws, is that the old committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:34| I guess, is set up kindly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| It's got 13 members plus ex-officio members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| And I see here where that committee would be abolished in January of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| The appointments that have been to the Greens committee approved by resolutions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:56| commission, they've been appointments by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| And in the bylaws that you all have, that I guess you've written or somebody wrote them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| has the mayor making these appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| The mayor would make a recommendation to commission, commission would approve those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| then, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Also, how much is at Three Ridges right now on the county side, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| I heard the number could be $600,000 they have in reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| It's close to that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Under this, what happens to that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| It stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| One of the things we'd be doing with that amount of money that has been built up over the years is look at purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| replacement equipment, still doing capital improvements to the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| Well, if I read the bylaws correctly, and I may not be, it seems to me that that money could be used other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| than Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| If you're reading that, then it's certainly something we want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| That wasn't the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Well, I didn't mark it, but let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| Of course, I understand, too, that, you know, the golf operation is under Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| and that committee is an advisory committee, not a policy-making or decision-making committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| so it operates very similar to what our park board does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And that's where I have a concern, because I think the golf committee at Three Ridges have been very frugal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| but they have done a great job in keeping that golf course in the-not a big golfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:34| but keeping the greens and keeping the golf course manicured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| and I think it was just listed as one of the top 100 golf courses to play at by some magazine just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| So I think these members have been very frugal, but also they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| And it concerns me a little bit about having that kind of money out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| that if I read this correctly, that the money could be used other places other than Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| Again, that certainly was not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| So it's certainly something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| And I think also, you know, we want to come back as soon as possible with that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| certainly carrying over existing members as well as probably adding a few new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| You know, if we need to defer this until next month just in terms of the bylaws for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and make sure we've got them right, that certainly would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| Well, if you look under section two of the front page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| it says these bylaws have been adopted by the Knox County Golf Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| And there's not even a golf board that exists that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| So how have the bylaws already been approved before we're approving anything today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| Which number is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Section two on the front page of the article one of the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5926)|
| 1:39:01| I'd say you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| I'd say you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| We probably need to change some wording there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| The other thing that I seen was that you will serve as the chairman of the golf board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| I mean, I'm all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| I voted that way in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I'm all in favor of the county taking this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| How I was thinking it was going to happen is we would leave the committee that's already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| and let them finish out their terms, and we can call them whatever we need to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| But I think they need to have some authority, too, other than just advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| I mean, those guys have been the ones that set this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| I think it is a different model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| And, again, if we need to defer this for 30 days to look more into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| that certainly would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| But I think the thing to remember, too, is it's a really different model now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| This is a model for a management team because, again, that operation is under me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| I will be responsible for its success or failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| So I think that was one of the thoughts in terms of I would be the chair of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| I, frankly, have got no problem either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| But do remember it is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| If we make a board that makes decisions about that, it's a much different business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| because then you're really giving that board the authority to run the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| You know, right now what that board does, along with the director of parks, is oversee a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| We're not really running the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| I thought there were a certain amount of monies every year that this board put back into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| And they have direct, I guess, the control of that money to do the upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| and where that money needed to go at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Just for capital improvements in the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| It's not the day-to-day operation of it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| So it is a much different model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| And not to say that, you know, there's a lot of different ways we can run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| But do understand if we change it, I think, and give the committee that authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| then it's really no longer under Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| It's going to be under that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| So it would be a much different business model than what I've got set up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| And ex officio members have, I guess, come back to this commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| And under section three that the senior director can appoint representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| from Knox County Departments as well as any other people that could, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| contribute to management of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| I mean, I think there are several things in there that I'd like to see changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| and this is just my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| because I think that golf course is being run excellent in terms of keeping the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:45| and being frugal with the money that's coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| And I'm concerned if we, you know, nothing with your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| but your department could always be cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| or this money could be used at the two other golf courses that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Do we have two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| We have two par three courses, but, again, those are leased out to a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| Do we do any capital stuff for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| We've helped that group from time to time, just as we've helped any other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| baseball, softball, park, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| And we do help them on maintenance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| But, again, the operation of those is a leased out operation to a separate non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| Knox Area Junior Golf First Tee of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| Do you see the money staying whatever's taken in out there to stay at Three Ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Because if you look at our budget, too, we've allocated out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| that excess revenue, those profits at the end of the year to go right back in the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| for replacement of equipment, for improvements to the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and essentially to pay off any insurance at the end of the day if we do have a problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:54| What about excess if we run over this amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| I think that's something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| John Troyer and I had a lot of conversation about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| and I said my theory is let's run it for a year and sit back down and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| and see if it really is running that kind of excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| If it is that excess, then I think we need to talk about what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| But, again, as the budget we've got set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| my hope is that it's a totally self-sufficient golf course, that the money goes back into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| that it replaces all the equipment, it replaces any capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| so we don't have to come back to the county for any assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| That's my goal with it, that it's totally self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Okay, see under Article 2, Number 3 and 4 and 5, at the end of the paragraphs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:44| it says Knox County owned golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| So that leads me to believe that there's some wiggle room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| that monies could be spent other than at three ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| Well, I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| I think we borrowed this from another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| so there may be some language there that we need to tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| that we missed the first couple go-rounds on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| Well, those are some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| So, I mean, I'd like to see some of them worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| especially with the board not being dissolved and start with a new board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| when we're getting ready to take over control of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| that some of these people have been there for quite a while, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| and have ran that golf course, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Yeah, and some of these things we're talking about, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| are pretty minor compared to courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Obviously, that's just some language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| But I do think, you know, if you give the authority for setting policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| and decision-making to the board, then it is truly a board-run operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| It's not Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| So I think, you know, again, it's a totally different business model there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Well, I'd like to defer it 30 days and see if we can get with the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| I'd like to talk to the Greens Committee, too, to see their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| as well as talk to you to see your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| to see where we can kind of merge these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| because it seems like to me that we're starting a brand-new chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| at the Three Ridges Golf Course, but we're getting rid of a lot of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| but bringing Parks and Rec in to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| And, again, my intent is not to get rid of that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| but just to bring along a lot of those current committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| and probably supplement with a few new ones, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| And then with some – I'd like to chat with you about these other things that's in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| about some awarding, because I think it's pretty significant what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| Just it may not be your intent, but certainly after we pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| then we seem to get into things, well, the contract you all approved says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| My only concern would be if we defer the whole package for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| I'm going to have a real hard problem getting everything done that we need to by January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| We wanted to wait and bring this to the new commission with all the new commissioners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| but I do have concern if the whole package is deferred as opposed to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| if we approve the budget and work out the bylaws later, that could certainly work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| We can start moving forward with hiring and contracts and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| If we wait another 30 days, that is really going to put us in crunch time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| Okay, let me see if I can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Make a substitute motion to approve a resolution of commission approving Knox County's operation of Three Ridges Golf Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| making the appropriation $1,162,697 for its operation for the 08-09,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:31| and defer the establishments and the bylaws of the golf board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| Commissioner Lugar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| Doug, I share a few of the same concerns that Commissioner Moore brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| I sort of see your role in it as running this course as more of an executive director versus being the chairman of a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6414)|
| 1:47:04| So, you know, some of these – I think they're details, but sometimes details end up – you know, can be the fly in the ointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:14| So I think we need to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Let the commission work with you and your staff and figure out which exactly business model we want to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| But, you know, I do share some of those same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| Yes, Mr. Patel, I think Mr. Moore brings up some good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| and that is that we do have to be assured that all of the funds, which this is a money-making effort for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:48| This is on the asset side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| And so we've got to make sure those funds are plowed back into that golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| That's the only way it will be sustainable in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| We can't start propping up other golf courses and helping them out financially, I think, on the back of Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| It is a jewel for Knox County, and it can be a lot better than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| In fact, I think under this present contract, it has actually deteriorated in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| And so you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| A lot of people are aware of that, especially the golfing community is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| And so I'd like to make sure that as this contract goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| that it achieves the position that it did back when the professional tournament was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| And it can be a much better golf venue than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| And then the same thing Scott brought up about the transition from the Greens Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| there are certainly some people on there that are helpful, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| So I'm sure you'll make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| Commissioner Moore, on your 52 motion, how long do you want to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| Just until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| I'd like to talk to Doug, and maybe we can talk to anybody else that wants to talk to him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| But I'd like to get some comments from the Greens Committee, their thoughts as well as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| And I had a workshop with the Greens Committee probably three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| So we've had a lot of discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Like I say, some of the details certainly we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| Are we out on Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Does this motion have the word in it, defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| So, Doug, this doesn't come, you know, at just kind of a flight of fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| You've kind of dug into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| You've researched the business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| You've evaluated other entities, and it's your expert opinion that having a board-run facility is not the way Knott's County did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:07| So you're committed to making this Greens, this golf committee, however it's constituted, an advisory, becoming an advisory in nature instead of primary operations, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| And just looking at how to run it as a business, I think it's the best model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| And not to say there's not another model out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| Probably two things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Right now we do not have bylaws for the Greens Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| So that needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Whatever direction we go, we definitely need to have good bylaws that identifies how we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| And that was just never done, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| And I think that you've got two models here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Again, if we have a board that makes decisions, I, of course, work for the mayor, so I could not work for that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:52| I could certainly be a member of it, but we'd have to figure out how that model would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| Because if that board is making decisions about all the policies of that, then that board is responsible for the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| Frankly, this model sets me up as the chair because it's more of a corporate model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| And, frankly, it's my rear end if it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| And you're going to hold me accountable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| I'm going to be very interested in making sure it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| I would have to go back and probably do a little research to see if there's a model where you assign this out to a board for its operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:24| There are parks departments where you have a board that really runs parks and recreation, and the director then actually works for that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| But I don't think we could do that here because I first worked for the mayor, so I don't think I could also work for a board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| I don't believe legally we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| I guess that's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| We'll have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| I don't know if we could blend those two or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Well, I just ask that because what I guess I don't want is you all to go away in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| This looks substantially different from what it looks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I think this is a good model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| I think this potentially can generate revenue and create a better facility and a better golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| So I just don't want you all to come back with a totally different rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Given that, I'm just wondering why do we even need a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| We have a mayor, and ultimately everything comes back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| It's underneath Knox County as far as the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| So no disrespect to Doug or whoever may be the director of parks and recs in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:36| They answer to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| And obviously then this body will decide whether or not funds will be spent and how to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| So I'm not even sure if we even need a board at all other than maybe possibly an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| It ultimately falls on the mayor's shoulders to make sure it's ran and he can hire who he wants to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| And then we get to decide how funds are to be appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| I'm not sure we need to go too much further than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| but I do think we need another 30 days here to try to figure those questions out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:20| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| I'm probably making a big mistake here, but I'm going to try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| You know, with a private golf club where it's membership-based, the board of directors is the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| And the membership is there constantly keeping an eye on the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| If there's anything wrong, the members of the club will call and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| I think to a certain extent we can depend on the public to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:55| But when the public is playing at a public course, I would imagine I don't play golf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| that they don't have the same sense of ownership of this is my course like they do when they're a member of a club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| And so with that, the reason why I'm saying this is that I don't think it would be a bad idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:13| to have sets of eyes of an advisory committee on that property taking a look at it every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:21| And I'm saying this because I'm not a golfer and you will never see me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| But I don't think it would be a bad idea to consider the golfing members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| part of that advisory board and allow them to go out and use the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| so that they'll be keeping an eye on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| And again, I want to emphasize I am not a golfer and I will never be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| So I'm not just trying to get free golf for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| But I believe that if we had some commissioners here that if they were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| the golfing members of this body made periodic visits to keep an eye on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| like the private membership of a golf club would, I think that that would probably be a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| and then make the golfing members of this board, this commission, make them the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| And especially since most of us have a very good relationship with Mr. Patel anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| you know, I've never called and given Mr. Patel advice on a park that it hasn't been welcomed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| And so I think something informal like that might work just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Oh, go ahead. I didn't see you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Some really good points have been made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| Commissioner Moore brought up some things I think we do need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| And here are just several thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| When we come back with you next month, we'll also present to you names that would be on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| And I do think you probably need a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| We have a committee at our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| We have a committee at our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| And the public input, Commissioner Uthoff is right, ultimately the decision falls with me and you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| But the public input has been incredibly helpful with those two operations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| I can assure you of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| It is our intent that the money will be rolled back into three ridges golf course only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| That's a valid concern and one that we need to address right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| If we don't, a golf course is sort of like maintaining our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| As you know, in our school buildings, we fell way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Over the past three years, we've spent $15 million in doing physical plant upgrades with your vote and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| So you may have to do the same thing with a golf course, or pretty soon what you'll have is a golf course that's run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| And, Mr. Lambert, I thought you made some good points with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| This mayor golfs, and I've golfed with most of the golfing members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| I'm not sure the skill level of myself or that group would qualify any of us to serve on a committee like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| But it's a nice gesture on your part to think that we might have that type of talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| You can make sure the grass is cut right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| That may be the only thing we'd be qualified to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| But when we come back next month, we'll tighten the loopholes, we'll give you some names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| and ensure that the monies which are generated will go back into supporting what is a real nice community golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Doug, the wording of the resolution as Mr. Moore just worded it, that still allows you to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| I think that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| We've obviously got a lot of work to do before the end of the year to kick this thing off if we're going this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| But you can proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| I think that allows us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Fix the bylaws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| And I would like to add one thing, too, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Something just occurred to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| I think when I was looking at these, I did have the thought in my long term that if we ever did want to add our other little par three courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| writing the bylaws as such and saying courses would allow us to do that if commission ever wanted to pull those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| So that was a little bit of a thought there that that would give us that flexibility in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Maybe that's not defined clear enough, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| We need to make sure that's there, that it's not there now, but it could be added in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| If we wanted to add Beverly and Concord Park under this umbrella, it may make sense someday to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| One other question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Would the county run the concessions or would you lease that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| Right now our thought is to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| It is a good profit center, so I think we'd want to keep that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| So I guess would the county apply for the beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| Quite frankly, that is the first issue I'd like this golf board to tackle, to say, is that the direction we want to go as a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| And certainly that's one of my thoughts in having a board like this for issues like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| that the group as a whole weighs in and says, do we want to do that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| Mr. Chairman, that was my concern a moment ago about the 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| If Mr. Battelle is asking that this be deferred for 30 days, then I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:47| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Just a quick word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I enjoy the PAR 3 courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| I'm not concerned that the money from this go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| But just a word that those two are done well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| and they're providing an excellent service to young people, especially learning golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| And Levi and I have played both those courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Wright, did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| I think everyone is clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7154)|

| 1:59:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:29| Page 19, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| declaring the State Street property a surplus and determining the method of disposal of said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Seven-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Ten-oh to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| But I believe the amendment was to put that minimum bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| $3,221,000, but since then I've come up with more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| that I'm passing around for everyone here to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| We approved it with amendment 10-oh, but I'd like to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| To fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| To fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| Could I ask for clarification of what the information is that we're getting ready to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| Commissioner, if you would tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| The expenses, it's broke down there for you when you get your copy around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| what we actually have invested in that property, the price of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| and all the expenses, replication fees, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question of our purchasing folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| Is there a purchasing folk here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7249)|
| 2:01:00| Hugh Whitt talked about selling this property at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| I think that was a discussion in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| Given the economic situation right now, given the financial market, the credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| some people would call it crisis that we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| selling it at auction right now, is that a good thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| I mean, could we, if we wait and think about what we could do with it later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| I mean, I'm just thinking of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| you pick up the Wall Street Journal and you see all of these headlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| and you just hear about the turmoil in the financial markets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Is this a good time to try to do anything with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| In your opinion, would we be better off to hold it for six months or eight months or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:51| I've spoken with Furrow Auction Company about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Of course, they're very knowledgeable about the real estate market in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| and the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| But I guess what draws this to the light right now is that we have three prospective buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:11| who are very interested in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| And I don't know six, eight months, a year, two years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| whether this opportunity will have passed us by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| You know, they, if we decide that we don't want to sell it, which is your prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| then we will hold the property and I would say that these investors would move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:37| And that is basically the gist of the conversation that I've had with Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| Is this the last piece of property in that area there that could be taken and something built on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| So if it's the last piece, and I understand the notion that, you know, once we develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| we're going to be getting tax revenues and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| But I'm just saying that from a situation of, you know, selling it now versus selling it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| given what's going on in the markets and with the credit crunch and so forth, I guess that was the question I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| But your feeling is that it really wouldn't matter if we waited as opposed to selling it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| Yes. I'll tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Rob Strickland, who is, he works for Sam Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| He told me that even though as bad as the housing market is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| Donald Trump sold a house just recently for $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| So there's people out there with money, and there's people in this area with money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| when some of us we don't have any money, so others do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| But at this particular juncture, you know, this decision is up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| I have mixed emotions on this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| There seemed to be some consensus a week ago at the finance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| The only debate was over how to spend or, I think, finally, how to not spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| We didn't want to spend it on anything if it could be put into the market and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| I agree with, I think, the position Mr. Hammond was trying to extract here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| that it is without question a poor climate for real estate sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| I think Knoxville is not quite as bad nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| I don't profess to be an expert, but I don't think we're as bad nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| And I think within the CBID, which is where this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| is even not as bad as it is in West Knoxville or South Knoxville or North Knoxville possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| I know there's a debate out there that we need this should be more or less land banked for a potential escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:52| Escape is not the proper word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| But to put, since this overcrowding mandate we're under with the jail situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| and I would just, we're not debating that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| but I would just think that that is a very, would not be a good use of that property right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:09| or almost in the middle of the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| I know all the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent monthly probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:19| but yearly for sure driving prisoners back and forth halfway to Morristown out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| and the money we could save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| But I think that when we come to resolving that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| and I may not be one of the people sitting here resolving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| but whenever the commission does, we look at an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| and I apologize to Commissioners Broil and Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| and I'm not saying that there, but it's like the Sears locate a closer in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| but out of the CBID for that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| So I think I would, I wouldn't, I'd take that off the table as far as a location for the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| to resolve the jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| And I wonder if we should be in the, and you see what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| I'm just speaking hypothetically, not in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| I don't think you need to speak hypothetically in someone else's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Okay, hypothetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| I wonder if the county should be in the land banking or land speculation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:20| If this is a valuable piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| and I thank Commissioner Pinkston for his numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| I read them on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| He put them up a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| I think that's basically what you gave us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| which runs this property at well over $6 million that the county has in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| We were thinking three the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Mr. Tory and I more or less agreed on about $1.3 million in interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| in debt service, for 10 or 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| So I said, well, four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| But now we're over six without even looking at debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| It's architectural fees, $1.4 million in this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| and cleaning it up and relocating somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| So it would be a miracle if we get, I think, six plus million dollars out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| But I still would be in favor of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| pursuing letting the market look at this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| to put it back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| And I sort of step back from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| I don't want to put it back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| and then some guy come in here and get a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| and it stays at that low rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| That's probably, again, another hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| I know there's a price for the TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| but I hope the TIF's not one for this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| And what Mr. Holt just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| the people out there with money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| but I think this is going to require somebody with money and with a lot of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Not just money, but I think he's going to need a lot of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| But I'm leaning towards supporting putting this out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:46| I don't know if 3.2 is the right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| I think that's a low number, and I doubt the support's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| But I would lean towards putting it back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| to see what the market will do with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| to help our downtown continue to thrive and be rejuvenated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:02| and see if there's some development possibilities for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| You know, I think we have an incredible opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| As Mr. Shouse just alluded to, the downtown is actually fairly healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| If you'll recall, last week there was a sale of a condominium for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| The real estate market here seems, and the downtown specifically, seems pretty vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| I think this piece of property really could contribute to enhancing that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| By us continuing to land bank this, we certainly continue the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| If we were to sell it, at least we recoup, if not maybe all, but certainly a good portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| and we can put that money to work somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| and we pick up immediately tax revenue from the sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| If we think back, and I know we all have a letter from the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| to the discussion regarding this piece of property several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| I remember there was no sentiment in this community to put a justice center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| I concur with that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| And I would think we should very seriously consider letting this property go on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| let's see what we can get for it, and then make a decision on whether to accept that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:29| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| If somebody could grab Sheriff before he gets too far down the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:39| We had a discussion about this the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| and we're talking about the original purpose for which this property was bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| It was to be a total justice system, which would move some of the courts out of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| and the jail down there into a facility that would hold it, and looking toward the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7794)|
| 2:10:03| We get the reports from the inmate report each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| They're pushing the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| They're letting them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| If there's any chance that they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| because they don't want us to be in violation of the law of overcrowding our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:23| I would like to know from the sheriff what his feelings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| Maybe we need to check with the police chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| see what the expert law enforcement people feel like is going to be our needs in the next five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:39| We sell this piece of property today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| If we needed it in two years, where are you going to find it downtown that's close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| that's going to save all this money in transportation costs and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| that this could save by using this particular piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| We mentioned the other day, a bunch of the officers are going to have to be moved out of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| and also the Andrew Johnson Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| This is going to have to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| We're running out of space in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| So this stuff has to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| We have to have room to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| And by giving away or, well, in this case, based on what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| if these figures are correct and we've got 6.4 in it and we're going to sell it for three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| to me that's giving it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| So where are you going to be able to put this much property together again if you started looking tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:34| So I'd like to ask the sheriff if he could tell us what his feelings are about the future needs for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:49| Sorry to put you on the spot, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:56| What do you need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| Jimmy Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| My question was, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| 12 Winfield Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| We're discussing the sale of the State Street property that was originally purchased for the Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:12| We've talked about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| We've got a lot more money than we can get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| But you're pushing the limit with what you can, the number of inmates that you can house at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7936)|
| 2:12:23| And some of the judges are letting them go early because there's no place to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| We don't want to be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| What's your projection as far as our needs for facilities within the next five, 10, 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| The thing that we're working on now, and we've already had several talks with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| talking about the planning stage of building a downtown intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| That's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| My idea where that downtown intake center should be is on the green space adjacent to the walkway across out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| Not a huge building, two stories, one below ground, one above ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| which would the small assembly would open up out onto a green space area on top of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| That's where, if I had my preference, I would want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| Would this facility have rooms for courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| See, this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Like we talked the other day, this building is getting full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| and they need to move some of the courts out of here if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| which typically you would have in a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| That's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| We're talking about a facility that typically holds prisoners for a 72-hour period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| the ones that we know are going to come in and be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Right now what's happening is as they're being arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| we are transporting them, as Commissioner South said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| halfway to Moorestown at $3.50 a gallon for gas and $4.50 a gallon for diesel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:58| somewhere around $800,000 to $1 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| just to transport people back and forth from this facility to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| This intake center would serve as a place to hold these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| and not have to be transported back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| where they can be taken to court through an underground tunnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| into this building to court, and then be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Sheriff, may I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| The people voted against this justice center at an uprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| They didn't vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| But they were given some bad press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| This was classified, according to the press, as a $90 million or more jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| The jail part was only going to cost $37 to $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| That was the whole complex with offices and courts and many other things besides the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Now, we spent $14 million here just a few years ago on another pod out there, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| Approximately $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| About 10 years ago, we had to build another pod because we didn't build this justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| How much was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| It was a little bit cheaper than what we spent the last time, probably $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Well, you're talking about we spent $25 million already in pods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| We're still in the same shape we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| We spent $800 million a year in transportation charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| So that's more money than even what the jail would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| Now, another thing, does that transportation charges, that doesn't include the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| That's what Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| You know, the city pays taxes, too, so it's costing them money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| And I'll just tell you right now, the numbers say that we should have two pods come online when we built this last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:43| So we're one pod down right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Now, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| Is the Knox County Sheriff's Department writing citations for people that are committing crimes like shoplifting and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:59| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| I know the city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Now, the city started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| They don't have a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| But, now, I have had people in business tell me that you come out, you write a citation to somebody, that's a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:15| You let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| You get another call a few hours later and they're caught somewhere else shoplifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| That has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| It's called a citation in lieu of arrest, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| But it does happen where you write them a ticket here for shoplifting, three hours later they're caught again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| These people need to be taken off of the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| We have to have a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| We're up here to make hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| And we've already, not this commission, I don't think there's anybody from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| but they've already probably wasted $20 million, with my rough estimate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| by not building that jail or that justice center years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| We've wasted $30 million, not counting $800,000, a million dollars in transportation costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| which is going to do nothing but go up with the price of this gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| And that doesn't even include the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| So a $90 million jail and justice center that we were talking about building in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:15| we've probably already spent that kind of money and we're right back where we were at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| if you include the city's transportation charges in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| I just think this needs to be denied, and if it isn't denied, I think with our amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:29| I've heard these commissioners, I've heard the developers, I've heard purchasing come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| and they talk about how valuable this land is on Gay Street and in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| Well, why has our property not gone up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| It should be up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| So it needs to bring more than the $3,221,000, with the first information that I got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| that we gave for it, which is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| We've got $6.4 million, $515,000 in it, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| So we need to get that for it, because for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| and whatever you want to say, if everybody else's property has gone up, ours has had to go up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| And this would be good money, and I know I'm going to get a lot of flak from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Well, you're spending money we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| If it don't sell, we don't spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| But this money should go towards a justice center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| or some of the things I proposed instead of going into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| where it will be given away at $15,000, $40,000, $50,000 of things that we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:36| This is a pressing need right now, a very pressing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| So is our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| Our debt is $613 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| We're talking about spending $40 million more this year, paying $26 million on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| It's going up to $627 million, if my estimates are correct, which I've got the figures here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| not my estimate I got from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| Our debt has gone up about 51% in the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| And that's something we really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| But we don't need to be selling our assets if we at least can't get the money out of it that we've got in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| I, you know, I said in committee, and I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| I don't think this is a good time to be selling property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Now, you know, I heard what the purchasing director just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| He talked to the auctioneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| The auctioneer that's going to make a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| Now, I'm a car salesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| If you ask me whether you should buy a car, you should buy a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| If you ask an auctioneer, should I auction off my property, guess what they're going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| Because they're going to make a commission on the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| The purchasing director has also talked to the three interested parties that want to buy this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8390)|
| 2:19:58| Now, if I'm interested in buying a piece of property, do I want the owner to sell it during a soft market when financing is tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:07| and I'm going to have, oh, only two other folks to bid against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| Or am I going to tell the person, no, I think you should hold on to your property a couple of more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| and then when the money improves and the financing is easier, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| then there will be five or six people, maybe, or maybe ten bidding on it, and the price will go higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| If I'm a potential buyer, am I going to tell you, you need to hold on to it for a couple more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| until the market comes back so I'll have more competition trying to buy this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| They're going to say, sell it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| Sell it now while money is tight, and I'm one of the few people that can even place a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| because I'm one of the few people that can even get financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| Guys, I said it in financing and I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| I think anybody that sells property now that has the ability to wait until the market comes back is foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8452)|
| 2:21:02| And I don't think Knox County is foolish, and I don't think we're desperate to where we have to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| and I think we need to, if we do sell this property, we need to wait just a little bit longer until the market comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| These three developers, do they think that their property is worth $6.4 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:32| They haven't said, but I would like to address Commissioner Lambert's comments in defense of Sam Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| There's been several times that Mr. Furrow has told us to sell our properties by RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| or not to sell them in his defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| In regard to the three developers, I have not talked to the developers personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| We've just been in contact with their representatives, just saying that they are interested in purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8514)|
