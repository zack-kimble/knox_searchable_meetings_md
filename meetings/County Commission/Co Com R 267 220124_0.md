| 0:02:20| Would all those of you that are in the audience that will be testifying today on either of these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| please stand and raise your right hand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=145)|

| 0:02:40| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| I would also point out that under our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| any person lying to or intentionally misleading this Knox County Commission and this beer committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=166)|
| 0:02:55| shall be guilty of the offense of civil perjury, just to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you, Director Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Before we turn it over to the clerk, I want to make a quick announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| that our representative from the Health Department could not be here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| but he has emailed us already, and he said that there are no issues with either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| and that will be submitted into the record, the email, per law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| So now I'm going to turn it over to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Okay. We have Easy Stop, Full Mark, 33-3216 Johnson Road, Knoxville, 37931,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| off-premises, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Good afternoon. I'm Tommy Hunt with Easy Stop, Full Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| I was hoping to be able to come to you today and tell you that we had gotten approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| and we're preparing to close on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| We got approval from MPC, but we've got an appeal to the BZA from a citizen that lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| out in the eastern part of the county, so we've got a BZA meeting Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| and so our contract is subject to the BZA approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| We're asking for approval of our permit subject to, obviously, closing on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| and then the approval of plans and CO from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you. At this time, we'll turn it over to Director Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| I'd start off. Kathy has told me that you still need to get a Knox County business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Okay, so anything that they do today will be subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I've got to ask you a series of questions as required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| You've already given your name. Are you a resident of the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Is the information on the application current and accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Do you understand that you shall make no beer sales to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| No. It's vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| So there is no outstanding license. That's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Is this an application for on-premises, on-and-off, or off-premises sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| Off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| We hope to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| Does anyone else have an interest in your business greater than five percent other than you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| My wife and I own the business together, and this is my daughter and her son-in-law here with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| and they'll be getting interest shortly as we visit with our state attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| Okay. So it's just a family business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| We've been in business since 1957 as Callaway Oil Company and since 1984 as Easy Stop Food Marts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| and we operate in ten counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| We're a family business. We take our privilege license responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| We have made errors, but we try to make sure those errors are corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| and the employees that made those are no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| With regard to this business that the application is for, who will operate this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| We will. Easy Stop Food Marts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| We are and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Our manager will once we get everything picked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Okay. Reports, the health department, we've already got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| Sheriffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| No concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| The codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Pending certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Turn it back over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Thank you, Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| I'm going to be looking for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| I have a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Okay, we'll test that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Do you want her to make the motion first or do you have a question before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I have a question, but do you have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| A motion and then a second and then a discussion after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| Motion to approve this application pending the business license, owner of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| approval from the health department, any other pending requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Commissioner Stuebmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Once you purchase the property, what is the timeline before you will actually be open for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| That's going to depend, we think, on Charles Blalock and company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Once they finish the extension of the road, we're debating now whether we go ahead and open prior to Blalock finishing the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| on to Middlebrook or if there will be enough traffic with school and everything being there to go ahead and open now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| And a lot of that, we've got a location in Maryville we're working on this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| and as soon as we can get the plans for it done, then we'd like to start on this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| So we're thinking probably late fall start and early spring or summer opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| subject to availability of construction materials, contractors, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=509)|

| 0:08:37| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Commissioner Bussler with the quick line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=525)|

| 0:13:34| Everybody bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I'm not great with reading in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| But this is a verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| It's Ephesians 610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| And every day when I was in Afghanistan, I read this every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| This was the part of the Bible I read every day just to remind me what I'm doing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So, very dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Just wanted to share it with all of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=833)|

| 0:13:58| And it's a little bit like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers against the authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| Therefore, put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=866)|
| 0:14:36| you may be able to stand your ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=876)|

| 0:23:23| That's the volunteer spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| And it's so much more than providing food, shelter, equipment, and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| It's the quiet victories you're in this community every single day, providing jobs, making charitable donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1409)|

| 0:24:38| And so many times we get to hear the complaints and we, as elected officials, talk about the stuff that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1478)|

| 0:24:53| going above and beyond to literally save lives, I think that's vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1493)|

| 0:25:47| This is true because public servants like you bring their time, talents, and ability to the job every day, giving 100% to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1547)|
| 0:25:56| And it's so much more than just driving big trucks or operating heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| It's the quiet victories you earn in this community every single day, improving roads, securing bridges, ensuring safe construction practices, mitigating flooding, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1560)|
| 0:26:12| I know all the entities who worked to overcome the trench collapse and the individuals who were saved are grateful you showed up in such a meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1572)|

| 0:27:36| I think we all saw it in the fires in Gatlinburg and multiple times since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| This community steps up when we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| So, this is just a great place, and that's part of what makes us so exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1664)|

| 0:28:00| This is a presentation of rural metro monthly report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| Welcome, Captain Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Jeff Bagwell, Rural Metro Fire 160 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| Our monthly report for the month of December 2021 goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| 824 medical first responder calls, 33 car crashes, 32 residential structure fires, 70 false alarms, 23 hazardous condition incidents, 187 lift assist or smoke investigations, and 249 car fires, brush fires, or rubbish fires for a total of 1,418 for the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1706)|
| 0:28:40| We responded to properties valued at $1.469 million and had a property loss of $976,000, which means we saved an average of about 40% of the valued property with an average response time of just under six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1720)|
| 0:29:11| 71% of the reported fires were contained to the room of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Station 30 in Halls continues to be the busiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| However, the Farragut Station is catching up closely, only behind by four runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| And the North Battalion continues to be the busiest with 510 emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| The busiest time for emergencies in Knox County this month was between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Through our partnership with Knox County, we added two new educational videos to the YouTube library and had 24,000 views for the month, representing about 2,100 hours of program time and logging 274,836 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1775)|
| 0:29:51| We also added 48 new subscribers to the YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| We had seven in-person events that had approximately 450 contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| So, total contacts via all the conduits was 24,639.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Our membership totals for 2021 grew by 2,000 new members, and if they would stop building homes in Knox County, we could catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| But we just can't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We're at 47.4% for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| Because of the growth over previous years, our parent corporation, Global Medical Response, has invested $1.7 million in new equipment for 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1822)|
| 0:30:32| Some of you were out there when Commissioner Daley blew the air horn and scared everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Sorry, Commissioner Buster made me bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| This will come in the form of a ladder truck to the tune of about $1 million of that for Station 36 in Powell and a new pumper for the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1842)|
| 0:30:52| This continued investment only further solidifies Rural Metro Fire and GMR's commitment to serving Knox County and its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| And once again, it's because of our supporters here in Knox County that we can even make those investments possible for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| As always, know that we're here for you at any time should you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| And I'll entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Mr. Daley, who's all these people behind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| These are all of the wonderful firefighters and rescue personnel that we have from our fire department in Knox County Rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| and I don't think we have anybody from Knoxville Fire here, that participated in the trench rescue a couple of Thursday nights ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| So we brought them to let them show your appreciation to them for the almost nine hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| and then if you add the Friday work where we had to go back to the incident and they had to actually pick all that equipment up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| clean it hours and hours, if you can imagine, with the mud of cleanup that they had to do on the shoring and the wood that they used in that trench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1907)|
| 0:31:57| So that's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Can they stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1920)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell. Thank you, Commissioner Daley, for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| Commissioners, we have had a request from Knoxville Education Foundation to postpone Item 31, the presentation, until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| Is there any objection to hearing that presentation next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| We will now move into the first segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| And at the beginning of that, I would like to recognize Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1964)|
| 0:32:53| We have an exodus of rescue workers going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1973)|
| 0:33:08| Sheriff Spangler is making his way. Welcome, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| I won't take as much time as the paperwork I have in this folder here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| It's just for my notes, just to make sure that I cover a few things that I want to cover with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Give you a little bit of history of what's happened with the Sheriff's Office over the past year, at least of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| First of all, let me say I've got to brag on the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office, the men and women of the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| I give them all the credit of everything that goes on with the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Those men and women have not taken a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| And when I say that, during the pandemic, when it first started, those men and women continued doing the job that needed to be job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| The support staff did the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| And I'm very proud of the men and women of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| And I think Knox County residents would be as well, especially when I give you some of the numbers that that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| And just to kind of give you an idea of what we have done over the past year and what I will start doing from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| And my apologies for not doing it before, but you're going to start getting some handouts from me so you can see exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| And if you have any questions about it, those numbers will come from dispatch and the numbers that we put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| So there won't be any question about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And you need to know our community needs to know what the Sheriff's Office is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| So I promise to get those to you just to kind of give you an idea of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| We generated over 27,000 reports, 27,000 reports over a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2086)|
| 0:34:55| Total calls for service, 149,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| That includes anything from officers initiating a call, whether that be a traffic stop or to help a citizen on the side of the road or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| But kind of give you an idea of some of the calls that we answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Just last year, we answered over 8,900 alarm calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| That's just alarms either at businesses or residents or anything such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Another statistic, our mental transports, over 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| That's a number I hope with what's going to open up here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| We'll put those numbers down a little bit or at least take those numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| Another one of our numbers, which I thought was very high, our disturbance calls, over 7,000 of disturbance calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2141)|
| 0:35:52| Along with that, over 5,900 domestic calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| So it kind of gives you an idea just a little bit, and this is just touching the very, just scratching the surface, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| just the calls of things that are going on within the Noss County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And that's on the law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| But what I do want to say to you as far as our corrections side, those men and women again have dealt with our shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| our manpower shortage, and we're continuing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| Those men and women are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| I initiated an overtime for those men and women to make sure that we cover things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| And does everybody in here know what, within our corrections side, what PREA, what that stands for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| It's our Prison Rape Elimination Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| That's something that the state has enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| And those numbers, obviously, we have to maintain a certain number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| If we go below that, then that goes into effect, and we are essentially deemed, if you will, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| And so we make sure that we don't go below that number, but there has been times that we have because of our shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| But with that overtime, we've been able to keep those numbers very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| One number I want to give you all within our corrections side is our medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| Just to kind of give you an idea of what we spent last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| And it was $444,000 in medication within our corrections side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2243)|
| 0:37:34| Kind of gives you an idea, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Yes, our budget is huge, obviously, and there's obviously some things we just can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| The population of our inmates coming in, we had over 19,000 people come through our doors at our hotel, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2262)|
| 0:37:52| 19,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| So those men and women doing the things that they do, again, I want to commend them and say thank you to them in front of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| and let them know how much I and everybody else appreciates them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Real quick, I was hoping to come to you all and give you some more numbers with the salary survey that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| but we are still talking with Evergreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| What Evergreen has given me so far, we have a total of eight steps that they're to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| We have been billed with two of those so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| With that being said, this is what we have gotten so far, this two-page breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| This is what we are waiting on so that you will know this is the whole packet that they will be sending us with the whole breakdown on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| So as soon as that comes in and we get that, then you're going to get a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| I'm going to make sure that you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| There's some more things, some more comparisons that they are doing, comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| and not trying to put people like O or NL, but the plants over there, of course, we can't compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2341)|
| 0:39:10| But anyway, I just wanted to give you all just a little bit of an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| and to say that more things are coming to you all and the handouts that you're going to start getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| hopefully will give you an idea and help you with what's going on with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| And if you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Any questions for Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Sheriff Spangler, in the salary survey, does it also have cost of living in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I would imagine it would, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| It should have something to do with that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I was just wondering, I don't know when it's been or how long it's been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| but to see the cost of living rate and how much it's gone up since the previous thing has to be astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| It's grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| I think those that were at a meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and they talked about the housing market and how it has skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| And that's another issue, too, and I think it's an issue for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| is the fact that bringing in new employees, they can't find a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| And that's an issue that we're finding right now with those people that we have recruited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| who want to take the job but can't find a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| And so we are trying to work not only with some realtors but also with some apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| to see if we can't make that happen to at least help us in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| And we're looking at if there's something that we can help establish with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| to give them a little bit more extra, whatever it may be, to help pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| at least for the first two months or something, that's what we're looking at doing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I would be interested in seeing the previous survey just to show that exact market increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Seeing no more lives, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Lee Muller is our first member of the public that has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| Sir, if you would state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and you have five minutes to address county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| My name is Lee Muller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| I live in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And I'm representing Knoxville Planning Alliance, Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| We've been, over the last few years, we've been doing sort of a deep dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| into trying to figure out what the cost of new development is for each house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| and what it costs in terms of infrastructure, schools, police, fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| And we've done a detailed one in some neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| but I wanted to go ahead and give a preliminary of where we're at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| from data that I've obtained from talking to some of the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| and finance people from historical data and from looking at public data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| I'm a consultant engineer and economist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I was brought here by TVA to help build their new control system for flood control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| and management of all their water stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| And I've got about 40 years' experience designing and building robotic factories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| site selection, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And so I'm more of a manufacturing-type person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| I'm more into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| I'm here today because my research of development patterns in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| leads me to the conclusion that the county is guided by false assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| which put it on a dangerous path to financial ruin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| The big mistake is promoting residential construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| in hopes of generating property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| The planning commission looks at each new product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| without consideration of other projects already in the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| or the total cost of roads, sidewalks, electric power, gas, water, sewer, police, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| and emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| So I've been trying to analyze this on an incremental basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| When you hit a certain number of houses, you have to have new this, new that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| I've gathered data from public sources and directly from the county departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| It's incomplete and it's ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| so if anyone in the county can provide more data, I welcome their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| In 2020, more than 900 apartment units were added in Knox County and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| In the city, the multifamily dwellings outnumber the single by three to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| In the county, single family outnumbers multiple by three to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| More than 35 new homes were built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| but only $7 million in new property taxes were generated by the new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| 2021 ended with 4,499 homes under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| just completed or planned for construction in that whole pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| So with the average population for each new stand-alone dwelling being three persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| that's 13,500 people moving in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Even if only half those people are new residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| all the new housing on the perimeter of developed areas has to have new infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| roadways, sewer, water, electric power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| and they've all got to have new police, fire, and ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| Many of these homes are being built by out-of-state firms and foreign investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| because of the attention given to them by Knox County politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| They're receiving zoning waivers, sector plan exemptions, and many other favors and subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| They're squeezing out the small local developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| and then they're going to another city, leaving Knox County taxpayers with debt for bond service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| These homes are not coming close to paying their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Each dwelling unit in new construction only generates $1,540 in new property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| The average cost of the schools for the new construction is $5,690 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| Every new 10,500 people requires a new sheriff's patrolman and patrol car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| The average cost of that is $450 per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Every new 10,500 people requires a new fire station at a cost of between $3 million and $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| The average cost of that is $1,270 per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| A new ambulance with advanced life-saving equipment is $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| It's hard to figure how many of those there are because there are eight ambulance services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and not all of it is public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| But generally, somebody's got to provide an ambulance for about every 10,000 new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| That doesn't include the cost of roads and utilities I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Those cost the loaners $5,000 more than the property taxes being generated for each dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| Knox County has a $29 million budget for roads and roadways and sidewalks this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| They've got a $200 million backlog, $140 million in Hardin Valley alone on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| New home construction does not produce revenue, and by subsidizing scattered, unplanned home construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| in violation of the growth plan, the sector plans, the zoning laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| it's making the county unattractive to high-paying manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| which could generate the necessary revenues by bringing in the kind of jobs that Knoxville could attract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| which would pay about 60 percent more than the median income in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| The top considerations of business executives in relocating are natural beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| opportunities for recreation, and fiscal responsibility of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| I think we're falling down on all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| The county is putting the taxpayers deeper in debt and pushing property tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| onto the next set of officeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| They're making Knox County a bedroom community for Anderson County and Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| and they're heading Knox County towards bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Anybody have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Any questions for Mr. Mueller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| In your research, did you analyze anything besides property tax, the sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| the economic impact of having a dwelling unit that has spending power, the jobs that creates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| Yeah, the sales taxes, I didn't include that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| The sales taxes don't come close to even covering the cost of the police and fire and EMS service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| much less the roadways and the utilities and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| KUB and First Utility continually tell Knox County that they can't provide the sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| and water at the rate the county is expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| So somewhere along the line, somebody's got to pay for the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| You've got to pay your way you should go, or you've got to borrow the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and have bond service that future taxpayers have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| But you'll have more revenue by bringing manufacturing, small, high-paying manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| than you will by building a house that has people who have a household income of $60,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| if you'll bring high-tech manufacturing that pays $120,000 a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| because that will generate the retail sales and things like that that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| I mean, that is our goal is to bring in these high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| We've tried our best as a commission and development corps to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| But we've lost several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| I'm working with a company from Europe right now brought here to look at this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| about locating a job, locating a pharmaceutical plant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| Average pay is over $130,000 a year because they're research scientists and engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| But they're looking at all kinds of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| One more, Mr. Mueller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you, Mr. Mueller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Mr. Mueller, Commissioner Hill has one more question, if you don't mind, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| While you're working on your numbers, a number I would be very interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| that would help each of us is how long it takes when a new home is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| and it generates X dollars of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| How many years is it before that additional property tax that is generated on that one home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| even covers the cost of, at that point in time, the things that need to occur to support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2978)|
| 0:49:47| Well, it's not because the costs I gave you are annualized costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| So you're saying it never covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| No, it never catches it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| You're $5,000 short on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| You're falling $5,000 per year behind on every new home that's built on the perimeter of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| where you have to expand services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| So when you scrape new dirt and build out like in Hardin Valley and Carnes and places like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| you're falling $5,000 behind per year per house the way you're doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| rather than infill development on existing utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Mueller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I just have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| You might want to hang out for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| There could be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Just a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| So your recommendation is higher density residential like high-rise apartments and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| Or to stop building altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And follow the sector plans and the growth plans rather than everybody coming there to get an exemption from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| because as you build in spots, you're having to run water, sewer, and roads out to these spots you're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| rather than a planned growth that expands, you know, just like your body building new capillaries to your muscles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3057)|
| 0:51:06| And what you've got to do is you may have to just put a halt to some of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| until you can catch up with the infrastructure and the fire and the police and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| so that you're not having to pay overtime and run multiple trucks from multiple, you know, far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| and run up your cost of servicing a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| So just stop all growth in the other room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Well, and also when you build in a spotty area like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| if you chew up 10 acres over here and 20 acres over here and 30 acres over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| then you don't have any big piece of land to locate a manufacturing plant like Smith & Wesson or Amazon or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3099)|
| 0:51:48| I mean, all you have to do is spot one subdivision on several hundred acres of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| and ruin it for that kind of factory or distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| Mr. Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| You keep mentioning fire, cost of fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| We do not pay for any fire protection out of taxpayers' dollars out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| But somebody has to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Only 40 percent of the subscription service and only 40 percent of the homes have subscriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| I understand that, but that would be part of the thing that you were talking about, the cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| But also when you build a new house, you know that affects about 2,000 other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| the material that they use to put in that house for jobs all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And without growth, without any growth at all, we have nothing to offer manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| When they come in here, if they want people to work, they have to bring people in with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| educating and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| And we've got the University of Tennessee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| We've got ORML and all these other places that bring people in, and they're looking for places to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| And they've got to have some place to stay for us to continue on that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| So there's kind of a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Well, I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| It's kind of one of those things where you pass it back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| And I was a member of the Home Builders Association for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| and was a charter member at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And we studied all these things of how much home building does affect the community in a positive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| and not in a negative way, like what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| And what they're doing, like in Nashville right now, in Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| if you have a house that's on an acre of piece of property, they buy that house in that acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| they destroy the house and put three or four houses on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| What we have here is we don't really use our density in the way we should be using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| And that's the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| And you were talking about the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| I was on that in the 90s when the growth plan was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| and we never revisited that growth plan like it should have been every three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| And so we just kind of got ourselves in a situation where if we quit building, we quit growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| If we quit growing, the expenses still go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| So what do we do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Well, I've been a builder, you know, and I've done large construction, like industrial things like seaports and factories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| They cost hundreds of millions of dollars, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| But I've also worked in places like Europe, like Switzerland, where there is no population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| They just continually increase the standard of living and the per capita income of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| The population stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| They don't have any growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| The people just get richer and richer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| And so I think that's a model to follow rather than just the model of just increasing population growth is something left over from 200 years ago when the pioneers came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3290)|
| 0:55:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Sir, I have a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| In your figures, you include water and sewer and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| The county is not responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| That's up to the utility districts to do it, and it's much like the fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| It's passed on to a prescription base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| You counted that in your figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Yeah, but the – as you know, you're receiving letters from them telling you that they can't keep up with the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3327)|
| 0:55:38| Large projects are approved without any facility for the sewer and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| They approve the project first and then try to let the utilities follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| That's – to me, that's just backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| And you did hear our sheriff just tell us that part of his problem with recruitment is the housing shortage in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| That's right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| The policemen starting salary is only $39,500, and housing price went up 17% last year in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| So – and I'm not trying to be sarcastic here, but I heard you say we need to save our large farms for manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| So in East Knox County and Hardin Valley, that's where we should put our manufacturing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| Well, I think you – right now you need to go for smaller manufacturing and infill some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3386)|
| 0:56:34| Take some of your, you know, underused or abandoned industrial areas and repurpose them because they're small companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3394)|
| 0:56:46| This is a high-tech area with Oak Ridge and UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| They're all kind of small companies you could bring in from other places that are expensive that they want to get out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| like California and New York, and bring those companies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| And they don't need a big footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| They don't need an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| They don't need – but just a few acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| They need an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Repurpose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Like the company I've talked to in Europe, I've had them talking to a company that's got 20 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| and does the same sort of chemistry that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| And so we're trying to work on partnering to let them build on their site with a long-term lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| and let that company make the core product for their pharmaceutical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| That's the big selling point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| We're trying to bring them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3461)|

| 1:00:27| This takes us to the second segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| And we have two speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| First, we have Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Welcome, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| You know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| And you have five minutes to address the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Kevin Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3647)|
| 1:00:58| That's what it's like for a citizen when they address land use issues at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| They get a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| They research and they ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| They submit comments, prepare a statement, sign up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| They speak and they bring up the points that they think are worth discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| But then the applicant goes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| And the Planning Commission always engages in a lot of back and forth with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| But the residents that have taken the time to prepare and come up and they've given questions for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| they hardly ever, ever get asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| I do want to say, County Commission, you all are a lot better about that, and I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| But I can't tell you what it's like to sit in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| You've made some points and questions, and it just seems like it gets ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| And I think that's worth bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| That's something I want you to know, because every month I hear from citizen neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| who they kind of feel like they've been run over when it comes to land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| These groups, they contact KCPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| They ask us how does the process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| We tell them, get engaged, sign up and speak, submit comments, and they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| And then they leave the meeting and they come back to us and they say, wow, I don't feel like I even was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| I feel like it was kind of preordained what was going to happen, the decision that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| So what I want to let you know is that you as a body, your appointments to the Planning Commission matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| The mayors, they make their nominations, and you then make those appointments based off those nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| The Planning Commission, they make recommendations to you on the zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| but they also make final decisions on use-on-reviews and concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| And it's really important that the commissioners that are appointed dig into their agenda items and ask good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| And that's a lot of what I wanted to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| Particularly, the use-on-reviews are really important from Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| During zoning meetings, we hear from Planning Commissioners in this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| we hear a lot of, you know, it's simply determined like the zoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And the Planning Commission always says, well, we'll get that plan back and we'll be able to take a good, close look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| But then the plan comes back on a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| And there's a lot of times if it's a planned residential subdivision, there's not a lot that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Last month, the community asked on one item, they asked, well, could we get a small playground on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| I think a lot of you were at the Legacy Parks luncheon where we were told that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| a child that has a playground within a half a mile of them is five times more likely to be a healthy weight as they grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| So the community, they asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| And they were told, and I quote by one of the Planning Commissioners, well, these are all good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| but this applicant, they've spent a lot of money generating a concept plan that was turned in a month and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And it gets to a meeting and they're told that they need to have a park now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Now, is that fair to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| And so the citizens, they're told, well, you know, we'll get a chance, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| and we'll take a good look at the plan, but then nothing happens when that plan comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| I know later on your agenda tonight there's a discussion about planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| You know, that's a zone that it encourages green space and amenities and it has a lot of different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| but it doesn't require that, and that's something that we run into all the time at use-on-review plan hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| And last month, thankfully, in December, we heard Planning Commission ask, you know, they're like, well, we need some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| And so we're glad that that planned residential process is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| But, you know, I just want to let you know that, you know, right now it's really frustrating for your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| you know, the people in Knox County that try and, you know, engage and participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| So my ask for you tonight is that maybe, you know, before the next round of planning, you know, nominations come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| I think in June, you know, take time to attend a Planning Commission meeting if you haven't been to one, you know, and go for the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| I'll tell you, like, tonight I'm wearing one of my dad's ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| He was an attorney that represented clients that were applying for Social Security Disability benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| That's what he did for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| You know, when he passed away last year, he didn't have a lot that I wanted, but he had a really good tie collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| So I'm wearing that tie, and it reminded me that I didn't understand his job and what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| until he invited me to come to court with him one day and actually attend one of those hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| and meet his clients and his judge and learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| I want to just add, that's my ask for you is, you know, you've got some commission nominations that will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| Please go to that Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Stay through the whole thing and see how it is that they're being impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| My other just small ask is to exploit the knowledge of the residents that come up here that share their knowledge and opinions with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3935)|
| 1:05:44| You know, they have a lot of knowledge, especially right in that little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| Just please ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| They will appreciate it so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Mr. Murphy, have you made your thoughts known to both our mayors directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| Because the nominations start with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| They don't start with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| I have not to them, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Have you made your thoughts known to the chair of MPC of how frustrating it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| I'm positive they have opportunities to get on their agenda, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| MPC doesn't have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| I would encourage you to, well ahead of it, go sit down with your mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| They drive the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Hey, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| How are you doing, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| MPC commission works off staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| I don't have the exact figure, but I thought you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| How many times does MPC's decision contradict staff's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| Some, but I don't have the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Planning Commission, they don't publish their case study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| That's actually open data I'd love to have, but I don't have access to that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| It's in a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| You can go look it up one by one, but I don't have the exact figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| On ours, and that's what's available to the public on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| there is the staff recommendation and then MPC's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| I'd have to spend a lot of time parsing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| I'm a computer scientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| If I could get access to the actual data in the back end, that would be a lot more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Is Mallory McCroskey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| I don't believe Ms. McCroskey is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| I believe that is the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Is there any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| I will recognize Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I would like to introduce the public and this body to the addition to the law director's office, Mr. Mike Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4081)|
| 1:08:09| He's sitting down there at the end of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| I sent a memo out to you when we brought him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| He is highly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| He's just recently retired from 15 years on the bench of Knox County Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| Prior to that, he was six years sitting in this very seat as the duly elected law director for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| And prior to that, 10 or maybe 12 years, he was a deputy law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| This man has done every conceivable suit in federal and state court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| The thing he told me, and I remember well because I've known him for so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| that he loves and it's his passion is land use planning and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| He is going to be sitting in this seat for all of your zoning meetings henceforth as long as he wants to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| So I introduce to you Mike Moyers here, and you will see him at the 7 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4143)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Director Buch, and welcome, Mr. Moyers, Chancellor Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| Commissioner Bussler, your line is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| I've been a member of the Rules Committee, and we've talked about a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| And one of the things we talked about some time ago was having some of our committees that certain people get to serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| that other people don't get to serve on get reports from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| And we mentioned that, and we said, well, yeah, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| But some of you get to sit on the Chamber's boards or be in those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| And also we had an audit meeting that I sit in sometimes and listen to to get reports on and see what's behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| There were some interesting things that came out of the audit committee this time that I thought was really unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| But we don't, all the rest of us don't have the opportunity to really get there and sit there and listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| And some of those meetings, though, in the audit report is a good time to take a nap because it is boring sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| But I would like to hear those meetings, reports back from the committees and things that you all sit on that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| the rest of us, don't get to sit on to give us a report of what's going on, what's happening, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| And I just thought I'd bring that back up because we tried that for a little bit and then kind of got away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| And, Mr. Chair, I thought we made some sort of rule that we were going to report on at least once a year or twice a year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| But when you have these multiple meetings like you do at the audit report and some of these others, I think we should hear more often from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I believe we do still have the rule that the chair of each committee is to submit a report to the commission office and the chairman annually of the work of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| We don't talk about it at our meetings, but that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Any other business to come before the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Motion to second. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Zoning meeting will begin at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| I call to order this zoning meeting of the Knox County Commission for January 24, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4297)|

| 1:22:25| I was able to pull some preliminary numbers that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| What they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| So the five-year population growth is an additional approximately 19,000 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| The projected household size is 2.29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| So the estimated number of new housing units needed over the next five years is 8,473.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| And that is from CBER, the Center for Business and Economic Research from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| In this instance, Safe Harbor has asked for three units per acre and MPC gave them two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4973)|
| 1:23:06| What they are asking for is consistent with both the sector plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| I think that the law department and most folks I talk to have some questions on the viability of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=4994)|
| 1:23:26| But what we're asking in this case to do would be consistent with both the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| and the growth policy plan to the extent that it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| We're asking for PR, which is one of the dictates of the zoning ordinance for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| We're going to provide sanitary sewers and water for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| We are connected to a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And the traffic impact analysis shows that it won't unnecessarily impair traffic flow along Couchmill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5036)|
| 1:24:07| Safe Harbor has agreed, and I think Mr. Snowden is here and he can talk to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| to working with Knox County Engineering to improve the intersection at Couchmill, Sam Lee, and Steel Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5054)|
| 1:24:23| which I think is a major problem for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| They've also agreed to build sidewalks from the property to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| And they're going to widen Couchmill Road from the entranceway of this project to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| I think Jim Snowden is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| If you would, Mr. Snowden, would you address what all Safe Harbors agreed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| Yes, John, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| Because of the request for three dwelling units an acre in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| were required to do a traffic impact letter, which they completed at our direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| As part of that letter, they found that the existing road from their development to Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| or pardon me, Steel Road, is approximately 19 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| They're adding roughly about 3,500 trips to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| So that puts that road at a threshold that it does need to be widened to about 21 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| We have a matrix that we use that kind of identifies road width versus ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| So their traffic engineer did identify the need for the road widening to 21 feet along their frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5135)|
| 1:25:44| and about a quarter of a mile beyond their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| They've also identified the need, due to our sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| to install a sidewalk along their frontage as well as the approximately quarter mile that they don't control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| but it would be in the right-of-way of Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And then, to Mr. Valiant's point, we have received complaints over the two-way stop control intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5161)|
| 1:26:09| at Steel Road at Sam Lee, and the developer has proposed a partnership with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5169)|
| 1:26:19| that would involve the installation of a roundabout there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| which would allow for a lot safer conditions as well as improved capacity conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| My point in all this is, you know, in a lot of these cases, you have developers come in that are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| you know, they want you to give them something so they can develop property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| In this case, we've got a developer who's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| They're willing to give back to the county, help the community, and correct some problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| that are in that particular area with regard to roads, sidewalks, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| Now, Hardin Valley has seen three new schools, an elementary school, a middle school, a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5213)|
| 1:27:05| And I don't think the net effect of this development going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| I said something like there would be 168 different students, but that's not taking into account the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| that there are going to be students graduating and people moving out of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| And also, West Knox Utility has put in about $100 million worth of infrastructure out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| including a sewer treatment plant and I think 8,000 feet of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| And my time's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| We'll probably have you back up in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| We have four individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| We have Gary Latham, Penny Wilkinson, Annabelle Hanks, and Mark Ritchie who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5263)|
| 1:27:51| If Mr. Latham, it's really however you guys would like to go is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| but Mr. Latham, if you want to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| And we'll have the timekeeper please set the clock to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Now, this doesn't mean you get a minute and ten seconds each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| It just means that, sorry, Mr. Schoonmaker, you looked like you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| So, did the four individuals sign up prior to the deadline on Friday to speak at basically public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5294)|
| 1:28:23| but because they're going to have a zoning issue, it was transferred to the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| My understanding is that is correct, and thank you for that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| I wanted to say at the beginning of the meeting that those who sign up to speak at public forum for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| we ask normally to speak when their item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| So, yes, they did sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| So, are they entitled to the full five minutes per individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| That is not the way our rules work for zoning, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| But they signed up to speak at public forum, did they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| Or did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| How did they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| See, they signed up for public forum, but we've flipped them over to the zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| I'll look to the Rules Committee to, does that sound like a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5348)|
| 1:29:16| I would have to look it up, but I would think that if we could go 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| if we could get them 15 minutes, give Mr. Bailey 10 minutes to rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| but I wouldn't advise to go over 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| So they need to watch their, that's three minutes per person, that's three and a half minutes per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| that's quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| But if you want to look, I'll look at the rules right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Well, under our rules, it's not always five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| But we're not going to cut anybody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| We're going to hear all sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| So we'll have the timekeeper set the clock at five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| and we'll make sure everybody's remarks are heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| and the applicant has ample opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| So, sir, if you'd state your name and county of residence, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| and we can begin addressing commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| My name is Gary Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| I live at 2640 Windjammer Lane, and thank you for your assistance in letting us all speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| We're very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Again, my name is Gary Latham, and I live at 2640 Windjammer Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| which is in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| And I've lived in Knox County for the past 51 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| and lived in Hardin Valley for the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| In 2020, my family and I moved into, actually moved into a newer neighborhood in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| And as you are aware, if you want to move into a different home in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| it's going to be new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| And I know some of you get tired of hearing citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| especially those of us who reside in Hardin Valley, coming here to discuss development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| I often hear you talk about how Knoxville is growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| all the while fully acknowledging District 6 as the fastest growing sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Over the last several years, I've watched numerous county commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| and like many, I did not have a clear understanding of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| It took me a long time to realize that developers are not necessarily at fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| with all the growth my community has been subjected to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| I also know that homes are needed, but should you not also prioritize citizens like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| who have actually lived in Knox County for 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Let me emphasize to you that the issue is not growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| The problem and ongoing concern is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| The growth you are allowing has been done with a lack of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| It has been careless, reckless, and thoughtless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Growth is great when it's done wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I'm not going to repeat statistics this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| I'm sure you've all heard those many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| What I am here to emphasize is that your choices do have consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| I repeatedly see this commission make decisions without full knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| or regard of the impact you are having on a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| You know District 6 is the fastest growing sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| yet you are not reinvesting within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| There have been minimal property tax revenue gains in years of unprecedented growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| You cannot possibly say that development pays for the infrastructure improvements that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| We are seeing how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| We know that you are heavily influenced by applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| and time and time again we see you are more influenced by developers than your actual voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| At the very least, I will say that you give the appearance of impropriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| Your decisions have an impact on our students, you, not the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| Not only do you approve zonings with the knowledge that our schools are overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| you do it with such complacency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Yes, a new elementary school is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| We are appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| This is a Band-Aid on a big picture problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| You approve zonings in PRZ zones without knowledge that a sidewalk cannot be installed because of sewage lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| Again, your decisions just became the problem of a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| or a county worker who cannot adhere to a sidewalk plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| I would really like to know why the exceptions are the new normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| These applicants do not even try to follow the land use and zoning determined in the collaborative plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| Why are the utilities companies asking the county for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| to pay for infrastructure improvements that they can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| because they have already increased the customer rates and are still not capturing enough revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| Let me be clear when I say that I understand people have the right to sell their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| They can do whatever they want with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I'm not asking you to stop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I'm asking you to do what was promised and what is right by your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| As frustrating as it is for me to be here before you discussing the same issues over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| we have been dealing with this problem for way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| It is my hope that you will listen just as we listened to you as you ran for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| and told citizens you would work for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| Carelessly approving nearly every applicant wanting to build in District 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| repeatedly shows where your allegiances lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Where does the accountability lie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I'm asking you to stop deflecting and actually listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Thank you, Mr. Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Next we have Penny Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Dutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Our rules state that the matter to be introduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| opposition may agree to any offer of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| neither should exceed a 15-minute time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| We agreed 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| That's what the rules say, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Mr. Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| You're Mr. Ritchie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| If you'll just state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| My name is Mark Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| I'm a resident of 12141 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| I've been living in Hardin Valley for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| and my property is across the street from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| What I'd quickly like to address is that this has been recommended for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| based on the Northwest County Sector Plan and the Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| The Growth Policy Plan is a 20-year plan that is now in its 22nd year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| Probably that plan was developed against data that was three years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| so this is a growth plan that this is being ranked against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| It's 25 years of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| We know there's been massive changes in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| The Northwest County Sector Plan, the boundary for development is bounded by Steel Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5711)|
| 1:35:21| is east of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And if you look at all the requests for variances on the zoning for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| there's been about 10 in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| So what we're doing right now is by segmentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| We're looking at traffic at small chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| We're looking at all this at small chunks against the big picture of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| So what we need to do is have this development and the others against a new standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5744)|
| 1:35:53| There's a plan that's being developed right now to probably two years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| We need a plan in the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| We need a bridging plan for these developments that get us to the new growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| So taking into consideration a lot of the things that this community has been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| So when do we draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| When do we draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| That's what I'm asking you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Got to draw it sometime, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| There's a development here that they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| There's another piece of property right below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| They're going to be asking for that property next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| It was recommended that they get two per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| They're going to ask for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| That's what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I'm asking you, we need a bridging plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Where do we draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| I say we draw the line right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Let's come up with a plan that bridges us with this and any other developments in the short horizon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| that gives us guidance for selecting these requests and let's start using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5802)|
| 1:36:52| So I say draw the line now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Let's figure out how to get to the next plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Let's get the sector plan aligned with the growth plan and use that as the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| So I'm asking you to ask for a plan maybe by your professionals on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| to come up with a bridging plan to get this and other requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| so we get out of this loop we are of segmentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| Because this is considered illegal in a lot of areas, segmentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| I know it may not be in this, but that's exactly what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| And that's really not acceptable in government, segmentation for the advantage of certain individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you, Mr. Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Would the applicant like to respond before the next two speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| or wait until the next two speakers have spoken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| Mr. Baggett, would you like to make any remarks now in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| or would you like to wait until the other two speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I'd rather wait until everybody's completed their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Next, I believe, on the list is we have Penny Wilkinson and Annabelle Hanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5876)|
| 1:38:04| I believe we have Ms. Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| Ma'am, if you'll state your name and your county of residence and you may address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| My name is Penny Wilkinson, and I live on Couch Mill in Hardin Valley in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5893)|
| 1:38:22| It seems by the time the rezoning request gets to you, you are heavily relying on the planning staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| But I am here tonight to ask you to look for yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| to see if approving the rezoning request in Hardin Valley makes sense at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| It seems that the Northwest Sector Growth Plan should be the most heavily weighted document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| used when making these rezoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| For one, the plan is not that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| Secondly, it has comprehensive recommendations and goals that have been assembled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| not only by community members but by builders, commissioners, and even planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| Yet the recommendations are being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| It occurred to me at the December meeting, December planning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| when I was listening to the decisions being made about the Couch Mill agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| that all parties are reading the same plans yet coming up with different interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| A Hardin Valley resident sees the Couch Mill property is not in the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| and the proposed subdivision staffs do not meet guidelines in either the sector plan or even the mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| Yet the planning staff are recommending two dwelling units per acre as consistent with the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| and then the buyer's council thinks that three dwelling units per acre is consistent with the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| There is a definite disconnect going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| The sector plan also recommends conservation subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| The plan reads, recommended to allow for development to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| while maintaining the real character of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| The Couch Mill concept plan does not comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Building homes largely consist of a minimum of one acre as this is the rural area of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| Even the existing subdivision right next to this subject property on Caspian Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| has larger, approximately one acre lots per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| In this concept plan, over 100 of the proposed homes are condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| which are certainly not maintaining the real character of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| You know what would allow for development while maintaining the real character of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| Building homes on one acre lots per the existing zoning of one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| So in addition, this proposed subdivision doesn't even come close to satisfying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| most of the performance metrics outlined in the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| of which Safe Harbor was a stakeholder and a collaborator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| I'm going to highlight a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Increased road safety, actually it does the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Couch Mill is already a dangerous road with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour that is rarely observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| Adding in hundreds of additional cars is only going to exacerbate that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| There are two roads that flank this property, Couch Mill to the east as it turns north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| and Dusty Way to the west. Neither have great sight distance as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| regardless of what traffic analysis shows on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| According to the traffic impact letter, based on Knox County policy requiring 10 feet of sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| per one mile per hour of speed, the required sight distance is 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| That would be great if people actually drove 30 miles down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| but in real life that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Also, this project causes the intersection of Steele and Sam Lee to exceed the county standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| for the number of maximum allowable daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| From the transportation impact letter, it states that based on the road width of 19 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| the Knox County standard, the maximum allowable ADC would be 3,000 vehicles per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| and this one has almost 3,700 according to that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| Waiting 8, 10, or who knows how many years to bring the roads up to an acceptable standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| with a roundabout or whatever it is that you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| a standard of safety is irresponsible to wait that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| The other performance metrics in that plan have to do with the preservation of rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| With almost 400 homes and over 100 of them being condos, that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| Increased opportunities to walk and bike, it actually decreases those opportunities in the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| Other metrics in the mobility plan are development options that require less driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| homes on large lots, access to jobs, shopping in schools, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| Is this project comply with any of these to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| When are we going to put greater responsibility on the developers that desire to build in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| to at least attempt to comply with the plans set forth for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| You have an opportunity and a responsibility to do what is best for the communities in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| not for the developer, the planning commissioners, the seller of the property, the buyer's council, or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| You also have a huge opportunity to be an example of a thoughtful, conscientious leader for our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| many of which are here today. How many Hardin Valleys do we have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| And they're watching you to see how you handle the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| These kids have a front row seat to the concerns this community has outlined today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Please do not let them down. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6158)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you, Ms. Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| Ms. Annabelle Hanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| Hello, commissioners. My name is Annabelle Hanks, and I am eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| I live at 11915 East Turpin Lane. I don't like what is happening around my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6177)|
| 1:43:07| They are tearing down too many houses and putting up too many houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| It is hard for the animals to live now without the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| There is too much traffic already, and more houses would make the problem worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| It takes too much time to get to the places we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| Do you plan to build a park for all the children in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| I would like a park for lots of children to come where they could run and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6215)|
| 1:43:44| There are already too many kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| I have a friend named Noah who has to learn in a portable because there is no room for him in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| Please stop building too many houses and take time to think about these problems I have shared with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you, Annabelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6249)|
| 1:44:24| Mr. Valiant, were there any of the concerns that you would like to respond to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6264)|
| 1:44:32| I am going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| We all know that Knox County has been one of the last counties in the southeast actually to start developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| Right now we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| We have got an opportunity here to watch Knox County grow and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| I understand the ladies and gentlemen in this audience what they are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| It seems that they are basically against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| There is nothing that I can say or that I have heard that is critical of what Safe Harbor is trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6304)|
| 1:45:15| They have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| They are developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| They are going to contribute to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| They are going to try to help with some of the issues that exist in that area in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6320)|
| 1:45:28| How many developers do you really find or that come before you that do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| There is just not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| I know of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6334)|
| 1:45:41| The plans that I think that the homeowners are hoping for is a plan that is going to start maybe restricting development more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6341)|
| 1:45:53| From what I am understanding, plans are going to start calling for more density because they want to use less land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6353)|
| 1:46:04| The denser you allow these homes to be built in, the less overall property that you are going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| That is not to say that at some point 50 years down the road from now all of Knox County is going to be developed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| But I can say that if you look at a satellite view of Hardin Valley, it is probably one of the least developed sections of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6379)|
| 1:46:28| How I know, I have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| There is a lot of farmland out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| I am sure people want to leave the farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| But the truth of the matter is this is a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| It is being developed by good people, and they are people who are going to contribute to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| And we are asking that in order to make this a viable project that we be increased to three units per acre, which is not that dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6404)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| At this time I will look to my colleagues for any questions or comments of the applicant or the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| You mentioned that the developer has offered to widen the road, include sidewalks, and build a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6433)|
| 1:47:24| What was the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Is that Sam Lee and Couch Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| It is kind of an odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| Sam Lee is north and south, and then Couch Mill runs east and west, and then Swafford goes north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6451)|
| 1:47:40| There are four different roads in there off the same location, but it is that four-way intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6465)|
| 1:47:52| So Couch Mill Road turns into Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| And this property is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Is that the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| What is the total price estimate of investment in those three public entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| I mean, the roundabout probably is, it is a smaller roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| You are probably looking somewhere in the neighborhood of $500,000 to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| The sidewalks would probably be, put me on the spot doing math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6505)|
| 1:48:33| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| Sidewalk would probably be another $100,000 to $150,000, and then the road would probably be somewhere in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| I mean, they are widening three feet on one side, so it would probably be another $100,000 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| So I would anticipate somewhere around three-quarters of a million dollars at a minimum to make those three combination improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6533)|
| 1:49:01| How does that work when you come into an agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| I mean, do you actually create an agreement in advance about what the improvements are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| Yes, we use the but-for standard that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| The sidewalks and the road width would be, we would necessarily be making those improvements, would it not, for their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6559)|
| 1:49:28| So they would carry the burden on all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| The roundabout, obviously there is traffic in that intersection today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| So there is background traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| There is traffic that is something that we would need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| And what we would do, much like we have done on similar projects, is take their traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| and make it equitable based on the generated traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| So the background traffic is X, their generated traffic is Y,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| and we would kind of percentage-wise the project out based on the background traffic versus the proposed traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| And is there any current Knox County plan to do anything in that area right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| No, sir, not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| This development would, much like some of the others have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| would change the cost benefit for us to where that percentage would give us more flexibility to make an improvement in a quicker fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6619)|
| 1:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Is Ms. Criswell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Becca Criswell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Okay, my apologies, Ms. Criswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| You had signed up to speak actually on another item and this item as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I had put both on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| I didn't know where they wanted me, but they told me I would be on the later item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Is that okay with you or would you like, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Thanks for checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Director Brooks, the planning commissioners voted unanimously for two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6655)|
| 1:51:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| And then I'm looking at a Hardin Valley quick reference guide that was distributed and it says your agency participated in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6669)|
| 1:51:19| so this is where the data came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Commissioner, what exactly are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| Well, it's building permits, approved lots, approved zoning, pending lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6688)|
| 1:51:35| It's actually a six-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| We do collect that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Okay, it's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| And then just quickly looking at this, it says that in the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| there's actually 2,252 approved lots but no building permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6712)|
| 1:52:01| Does that sound about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| I mean, I haven't actually taken this and verified it with our staff, but I know that Mr. Murphy did request data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| so I'm assuming that it would be correct, but I haven't checked it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6735)|
| 1:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| And then it looks like there's an additional 1,069 lots that are up for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| but no concept plan has been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| And then, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Director Snowden, on the information that you provided for Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6761)|
| 1:52:52| is that agreement in writing or is that based on if they get approval to do this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6772)|
| 1:53:02| how is that stipulated that Safe Harbor would pay for those improvements to Coward Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6782)|
| 1:53:10| It all depends on the number of lots because, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| the traffic study is what we use to establish that equitable cost share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| So, really, with not knowing the density and the total number of trips being generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| we really can't draft that agreement until such time that that density is codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| and we know the number of trips to codify the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| But you already have the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Yes, but it's predicated on three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| And then on the roundabout, do you think it will be a 60-40, 70-30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| They would pay probably over half of it because, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| they're bringing a lot of traffic to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I don't know the exact specifics, but they would be paying a sizable portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| No more other questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Mr. Snowden, I assume that at two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| the only thing they would be responsible for, the developer, would be the sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| That matrix, I think 3,000 trips is the next point where it trips over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| So, yeah, there's a possibility that a reduction in density would create less public transportation improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| So that means at two units an acre, no roundabout, probably no road widening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| there's no intersection realignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| It's a possibility, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| In your engineering mind, at three units an acre versus two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| that's 131 additional houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| What is the tradeoff there as far as safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| That's about 1,300 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| You know, a single-family home generates about 10 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| The width of the road is not too concerning with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6917)|
| 1:55:25| I mean, it's 19 feet wide now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| so that's better than a lot of the roads we have in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| A lot of them are 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| I do think the intersection, you know, it's one of those ones we don't have on our radar now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6936)|
| 1:55:45| just due to the low traffic volumes in the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| but that would be one that I think would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| it would change the dynamic, or to my point with Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| of the cost-benefit analysis that we may or may not be able to assist in the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| without that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| Ms. Brooks, when the MPC Commission considered this at two or three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| did they have the information on the improvements that would be made to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| the sidewalks, and the roundabout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| Those improvements were discussed during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Probably not quite as in-depth as Mr. Snowden has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| in terms of answering the questions that you all had this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| And there was reference to plans and growth in some of the speeches tonight so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| Could you discuss, I mean, a lot of people think this commission has done nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| that we haven't seen the problem that our growth plan is 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| But this commission, before most of you all were on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| took on the growth plan and tried to update these plans, and we weren't able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Could you give us, you know, it's almost made people think that commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| hasn't addressed this and that planning staff hasn't addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| Could you talk a little bit about that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| About the update to the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| Yes, we started about four years ago, and if we'd actually been able to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| we'd probably be operating under something a little bit more modern right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| I mean, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| The mayor's office did try to move forward with some amendments to the growth policy plan in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7053)|
| 1:57:42| Additionally, I would point out that, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| and it was mentioned this evening that we are in the midst of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| and just recently kicked off an update, actually not even an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| a brand new land use and transportation plan that you all have supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| which is a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| It is a huge opportunity for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| and the intent is that it will result in a new map that will address many of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| that are before you this evening and that have been before you over the last five, six, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| The sector plan for this area was updated in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| and as the data shows, this area has been under tremendous development pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| But there is an updated plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| I don't know if that answers your question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| I'll ask Commissioner Daley this because I know he was in the joint education meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| and as I think you were, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| The new Northwest Middle School, I'm trying to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| did they tell us it would be ready to be open in 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7131)|
| 1:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Commissioner Durett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Mr. Valiant, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| Ms. Hanks, in her very well-spoken speech, thank you for doing that, by the way, Ms. Hanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| she asked a very important question, so I will pose that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| Do you plan on building a park in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| It's my understanding, and this gentleman here might be able to address it better than I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| what I understand is they're going to have walking trails and a lot of open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| which will include a park within this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| He knows more about the development than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| Yes, I'm David Harbin, engineer for the project with the Patson & Himes 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I was on it beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Yes, I've been engaged by Safe Harbor Development to prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| and we have done a concept plan that has been submitted but not acted on yet by planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| In that, there's a lot of challenges in this area, so we ended up with almost about 33 acres of open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| and in that open space will allow us to have a rather large network of walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| There will be multiple parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| There will be a dog park, other types of parks throughout the neighborhoods if we're permitted to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| So there will be quite a bit of an investment right there for what Safe Harbor wants to do for their residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| and for residents of everybody in Hardin Valley at that point then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| And there will be two different price points right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| There will be some attached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| And the good thing about the attached houses is they're basically marketed to either single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| or a single-person family or to empty nesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| So typically their impact on the area is not nearly as great as a single-family house with a growing family right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7253)|
| 2:01:02| So if you allow us to have the attached units right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| they really don't have as much impact as all single family would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| So I think there are some advantages, if approved, for the people of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| that we could have with the walking trails and the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Director Snowden, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| The Hardin Valley Church of Christ, have we reached out to them yet to talk about the continuation of the sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| It looks like if this development is implemented that that's the only section that will not have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| Right there in front of Food City has them and the development right on the way to Food City has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| Has anyone reached out to them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| We're in the process of doing that, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| The subdivision there, forgive me, I'm trying to recall the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7317)|
| 2:02:08| This one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| It's the Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Yeah, the Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| They were required to install a sidewalk along their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| So you're right, there's a missing gap between there and kind of towards the Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| and an even missing sidewalk along the west side of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| So we're actually in conversation with the design engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| and hopefully going to bring a capital project for your all's consideration in the fiscal 23 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7355)|
| 2:02:42| to make that connection so that the folks that live in the Brook can navigate a sidewalk along Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7362)|
| 2:02:51| and then even install some new sidewalk along the west side of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| There's sidewalk on the east side of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| There's not sidewalk on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| So we're hopeful to get that installed sometime next calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| Where would the crosswalk be placed for them to go to the west east side of Steel Road in front of the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| It would be there in the school zone itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| That would be the most safest place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Obviously, you'd still be able to cross there at the traffic signal, which is a very safe location also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| But there would be a mid-block there, which I think the school resource officer could control and allow for safe passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7401)|
| 2:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| I want to start out by saying how much I appreciate the community involvement in this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7427)|
| 2:03:54| that I lost count at about 100 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7434)|
| 2:04:01| And I told one of you out there that I took pride in answering my emails, and he said, oh, you answered mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7441)|
| 2:04:10| I didn't answer everybody's, and I apologize because literally as I was answering them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| they were coming in faster than I could get them answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| But please know that I did read every one of them, and I did hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| I do have several questions and comments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| Ms. Brooks, did you say that the units needed over the next five years was roughly 8,700?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7470)|
| 2:04:45| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| That's one projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| That's from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| It's approximately 8,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| Does that number take into account the already disputably between 3,000 and 4,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| that have already been approved in Hardin Valley in the next five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| So that right there, I think, is a very valid consideration that we need to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7508)|
| 2:05:18| if we're being told that we need roughly 8,400 homes and already somewhere between 3,000 or 4,000 of those are already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7518)|
| 2:05:29| or in the queue in Hardin Valley already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| Already Hardin Valley is taking roughly by this number a third of the burden of the whole county for housing needs coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7532)|
| 2:05:45| That's before we even talk about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| So I'd like to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7548)|
| 2:05:57| I'd just like to point that out that Hardin Valley is already doing their fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7557)|
| 2:06:07| This is 131 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| If this is approved at three per acre, that's roughly 262 homes that could be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7572)|
| 2:06:26| Is that actually how many in the concept plan that are being proposed, Mr. Harbin, Mr. Valiant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7586)|
| 2:06:41| Actually, it's a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| Three times 131 is like 393, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| So it will be in that neighborhood right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| My math was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| So how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| 393 in that neighborhood right there, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| I'm looking at, I appreciate what you said about 33 acres that will be undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7620)|
| 2:07:09| Is it fair to say it's probably because it basically can't be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7629)|
| 2:07:19| And that's why we asked for three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| If this was a good area that didn't have these challenges, we would be asking for four and five units an acre right there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| So we were able to cluster the areas in the more developable portions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| And, you know, that gives us the flexibility to really add some value to the community right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| to put in the parks and to put in the walking trails, to put in the playgrounds that will benefit for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| Gallery, please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| That would be open for the residents, obviously for the residents that we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| But, you know, if somebody else would like to walk over there and to use those, you know, they'd be open for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7674)|
| 2:08:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| I'm not going to be exclusive to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| I'm looking at the, which I know this is just recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| but the slope analysis that is included in the evaluation that the Planning Commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7688)|
| 2:08:18| I noticed that its recommendation for that piece of property is 116 units, which is roughly about one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7698)|
| 2:08:31| Can you address how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| I mean, if, again, I know it's only a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| and I know that we can do a lot of things with property these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| but that's almost three times more than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| Could I address that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| The slope analysis that we get from staff a lot of times, I think, is that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7734)|
| 2:09:05| it's not based on any sort of a scientific study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| In this particular slope analysis, if you look at the topography of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7750)|
| 2:09:19| 71.4% of this property is non-hillable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| 81.88% is less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| So it's a great piece of property to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| So it's got a very small amount of steep terrain on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7775)|
| 2:09:44| If you're talking about the two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| it could have easily been put in three units per acre, 3.5 or whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| I've looked at these in every development I've come down here on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| and the numbers that they use just seem to come out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| I can't figure out where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7806)|
| 2:10:15| I want to say that the community may or may not know that myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| and several others sat down actually with Mr. Harbin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7822)|
| 2:10:30| and Mr. Mullins representing the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and did try to talk about what might work best for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| as opposed to what the developer wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| and we were not able to come to a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| although I very much appreciate you being willing to come to the table in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7849)|
| 2:10:59| And just one more point for the steep areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| Most of the steep areas are in the common areas right there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| that we weren't planning on developing in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| So the areas that we show development in are in that 15% or less range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7868)|
| 2:11:15| and so that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| And once again, remember that we're also a good portion, a third of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| will be age-targeted to either the empty nesters or the single person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| which will have much less impact on the road system and on the school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| This is tough for me, I have to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| because personally I am a property rights person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| and I really do believe that people should have a right to develop their properties they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7902)|
| 2:11:51| I do understand that this sale is not final, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7911)|
| 2:11:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| So the people that currently own this, clearly it was a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7922)|
| 2:12:13| I think Mr. Ritchie put it best when he said, where do we draw a line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7933)|
| 2:12:23| When do we draw a line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| I will tell you, Hardin Valley is really on the brink right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| and it can go one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| It can continue just being development after development after development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| without especially the roads that need so much attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7960)|
| 2:12:50| or we can sit back and begin to be a little more thoughtful about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| I have full confidence when this development plan, this new comprehensive plan is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| that that is exactly the type of thing that it's going to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| and it's just unfortunate that it's probably going to be another year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| or two years before this plan will be completed and we can actually point to something more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7990)|
| 2:13:18| I do hate that because it really is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| But in the meantime, I do believe we need to be very thoughtful about a plan that does bridge us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8005)|
| 2:13:35| I think, Mr. Ritchie, I think that you put that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| What really hears me about this area is that it is an area that so far is pretty much very rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8021)|
| 2:13:51| The one development that is within view of this property is, in fact, over one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8031)|
| 2:14:02| and it's been there for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| But it is not a fair statement to say that it's consistent with other development that surrounds it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8046)|
| 2:14:14| because it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| It is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Everything around this is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| This is actually one of the areas of Hardin Valley that hasn't quite been invaded yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| and I have got to listen to the people of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| They have made it very clear on this particular development in this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8073)|
| 2:14:47| No one is saying never, but they're saying now is not the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| And I do have to support that, and I do support it as difficult as, I will tell you, as difficult as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8092)|
| 2:15:01| because I do really, I like smart growth and development, and I think Safe Harbor has done a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8101)|
| 2:15:09| This is not at all personally directed at them, because I do agree they are one of the good ones in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8109)|
| 2:15:20| They do a good job when they do build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| I just don't think that there's any justification to warrant an amendment to this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| It's located in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| It's surrounded by agriculture, and I would, quite frankly, like to see it stay the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8137)|
| 2:15:48| understanding that's probably not realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| I'd like to make a motion to approve one per acre as it's currently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8152)|
| 2:16:03| I have a motion from Commissioner Hill to approve this rezoning at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| There's a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| Second is by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Commissioner Jay, you're recognized, and then Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| Whoever is representing, whoever wants to speak on the engineer, Mr. Valiant, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| I just want to make sure, if I'm in Mr. Snowden, feel free to weigh in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| The developer is asking for three units an acre and saying if they're approved at three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8200)|
| 2:16:50| then they will invest approximately $750,000 into public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| including sidewalks, roundabouts, and widening the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| But if they're not approved at three units an acre, then whatever they're approved for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| they will essentially follow the rules and do the bare minimum that is required by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8226)|
| 2:17:12| but not invest in any other of the public infrastructure that's in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| That might be a little harsh way to put it, but if we get the three units per acre, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| we're going to work with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| And I don't know exactly what the dollar amount is, but if it's $750,000, it's $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| I think that what Mr. Snowden was talking about, that if you start coming in lower than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| then there's some formula that they use for the amount of money that they would be asking us to participate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| And so if it's two units or one unit as the motion is on the floor, then it may be virtually nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| And the development may not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| I just want to make sure I'm clear with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| I mean, I think this is the first of a bunch of discussions that we're going to have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| Obviously, the conversation continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| The e-mails continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| And, look, we all hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| We all read and we all discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| This is at least the three and a half years I've been on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Land use continues to be the hardest thing in a growing county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| Everybody wants to be the last one to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| Everyone wants to pull the drawbridge up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| Everybody wants to wait until infrastructure catches up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| And I feel like we're in Groundhog's Day continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| But we're also in a county that has decided for close to 30 years to never raise taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| and have the revenue necessary to be able to do public infrastructure, to never get ahead of it proactively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| and to use development and growth as our way of building a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| So we have decided as a community to rely on private development in order to push infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8338)|
| 2:19:06| to build it and hope they will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| It's not part of anybody's conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| It's when they build it, we'll catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| And so that is a community-wide decision that started long before anybody that's sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| We're going to have this discussion in every part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| I mean, 30 years ago, Cedar Bluff looked exactly like Garden Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| And so it was developed, and as it was developed, then infrastructure was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| and it was backfilled with more infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| And so it's chicken and egg all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| I don't think there's a right or wrong answer in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| But at the same time, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| the very first gentleman who spoke, and I've read your e-mail and I've seen you spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| you live in a neighborhood that was four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| The stones grow from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| It seems like every time we go through this, we end up in the same discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| I live in a neighborhood, I love it, but I don't want anything else to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| And we're growing so fast, there's only a couple of knobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| If you don't have inventory, then the prices will rise, and everybody will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| well, we can't afford to live here anymore because houses are going off the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| If you have more inventory, then the prices come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| but people don't want the development and the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| I mean, it's not a yes or no answer, and so it's a balancing act all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| But, you know, we're going to do this over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| At some point, we have to decide as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| do we want to rely on development to build out our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| Do we want to rely on private development to fund what is necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| Or do we want to fund it ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| Or do we want to just go round and round and round and continue this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| So I don't know if there's an answer in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| Essentially, if this is approved as it came out of the county planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8462)|
| 2:21:12| or as proposed on the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| then you're going to still end up with a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| but you're not going to end up with any infrastructure to support that development, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| And if it's not this developer, it will be the next developer and the next developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| I mean, every one of these areas, yes, this is a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| but it's also within half a mile or a mile of a brand-new set of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| I mean, we're having the same conversation in Gibbs, in Commissioner Buehler's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| which is when you have asked for new schools and you get new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| and new infrastructure in your education, people move to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| That's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| It's an attractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| So I would guess that looking forward two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| the growth plan will say this is a higher growth area, this whole section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| because you're right next to the school and that's where people congregate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| but we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| I did want to just clarify, you know, what comes with it or what doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| But I do think, I do warn the community that the idea that it's time to stop completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8534)|
| 2:22:23| which everybody says we're not against development but don't develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| it is going to have other adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| And this community is also fully not prepared to ask this mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| and this commission to raise taxes to build $100 million worth of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| It's clear it has not happened for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| I mean, I did one small calculation with our engineering department recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| just to look at widening Hickory Creek Road at the intersection of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8568)|
| 2:22:56| all the way to Rot Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| If that's going to be another corridor, how do we do four lanes of highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| or four lanes of the turn lane and sidewalks and just go ahead and get ahead of it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| It's $31 million and it would take five years if you had the money today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| Our entire capital budget for the entire county was $18 million last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| There's not a chance that a third of that is going to go to one project in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| And it's not a chance that this commission is going to approve a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| to raise another $31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| That's just for one road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| So what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| Do you wait for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Do you get ahead of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| Do you raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| I don't know the answer, but this problem is not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| It's not going to go away anytime soon, and we have to decide where we go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| But right now, this community, a society of private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| has to drive growth and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| I think this is the first development that I can remember since I've been on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| that they're offering to widen an entire road a quarter mile, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| and a roundabout, and add sidewalks, and add parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| I mean, as a commissioner, this is what we always ask for when developers come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| is to do these things for us, and this developer is actually offering to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| for our community that we have no plans to help this community out in that way currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| So I'm going to make a substitute motion for three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| given that we have an agreement that they will help out with infrastructure improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| as they stated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| I have a substitute motion from Commissioner Ward to approve this rezoning at three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| I have a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Commissioner, I'm sorry, Commissioner Lundy, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| All those in favor of the substitute motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8705)|

| 2:27:24| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve RA Low Density Residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| because it is a minor extension inconsistent with the sector plan by a vote of 14-0 consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=8848)|

| 2:39:02| We'll revisit one more time Item 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| The applicant is Roy Trenton-Primm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| Mr. Primm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9555)|
| 2:39:23| Seeing how this is not a zoning per se issue, it's a name change, our rules highly recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9563)|
| 2:39:32| somebody be present, but I'm not sure if they require them to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9572)|
| 2:39:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| Mr. Daly, is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| I'm pretty sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| I think that, especially when Daniel was our law director, he said for safety purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| that person needs to be here because if we make a decision they're not here as representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9591)|
| 2:39:57| we could end up with lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| Especially on zoning where somebody has land rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| This is just a name change of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| Oh, I would, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| We can suspend the rules and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| That's a man sitting right up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Mr. Law Director, I'll look to you for advice on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| You can suspend your rules and allow this to go forward without anybody being represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| if that's what you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Commissioner Smith, would you like to offer a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| Yes, I offer a motion that we approve number 36, road changing name, as recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9626)|
| 2:40:38| I think the law director has recommended that we suspend the rules to allow us to hear this matter without the applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9638)|
| 2:40:46| Can I make a motion to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith and a second by Commissioner Ward to suspend the rules and allow this item to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| Commissioner Skinnecker, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| Director Brooks, how did we get this opportunity to have it come through your office first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| Commissioner, I have to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| This is the first one that I have seen come through during my time with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9670)|
| 2:41:17| My understanding is that, well, we have the addressing staff within our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| and they have to review and approve all street name changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| So, we don't review right-of-way closures for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| but my understanding is that they still have to approve street name changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| Okay, because this is the first item I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| It's fairly rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Commissioners, we need to vote on the motion to suspend the rules before we move forward with any discussion of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| All in favor of suspending the rules, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Let the record reflect the vote was unanimous to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| Actually, Commissioner Biggs is not in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| There he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9719)|
| 2:42:00| He is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| Commissioner Smith, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| I wanted to ask Director Brooks about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| From what I could see, this is a very short piece of road with no actual addresses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9730)|
| 2:42:22| Yes, my understanding on this one is, and it states this in the Commission recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| is that there is confusion related to the intersection of the street with two other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9747)|
| 2:42:35| It's a very short section, and I guess whenever there's emergency calls at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| it has been causing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| But there are no actual mailbox addresses on that section of that road, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| I make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| The motion is by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| Madam Clerk, would you read item 36 into the record again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9777)|

| 2:43:25| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| Any discussion of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| We have a proper motion and a second to approve per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| Is that correct, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9817)|

| 2:43:53| Madam Clerk, we'll move on to item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| Mr. Chairman, we're back in regular rules, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9838)|

| 2:46:28| MPC unanimously voted to give them three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9988)|
| 2:46:34| And in order for this project to be viable, they have to have actually 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=9994)|
| 2:46:45| This land is largely flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| Once again, I'm going to the staff's slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| 68.4% of this is non-hillable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| 95.2% of this has a 15% slope or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10019)|
| 2:47:06| So it is a developable piece of property where the homes will lie flat for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10026)|
| 2:47:14| There is going to be large portions of this property that won't be developed, plus the part that they are giving to Knox County to straighten out Gallaher Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10034)|
| 2:47:26| which is one of the reasons why we also need a little more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| As I've said before and for this record, we're going to have to make a decision whether we want to lose less land with more density or more land with less density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10051)|
| 2:47:45| And what I would hope to see is using less land, putting a little more density on it, so that we won't eat up the entirety of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10065)|
| 2:47:56| which, you know, is coming within the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| If anybody has any questions about this development, I have Mr. Ryan Hickey here that can answer any questions that you may have about this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10079)|
| 2:48:07| or what they're going to do to help Knox County out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| I will remind my fellow commissioners we are hearing the item that has to do with the second plan amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10093)|
| 2:48:20| We will not be voting on density until the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| I do want to give the opposition a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| Mr. Green and Ms. Criswell, whichever would like to go first is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10109)|
| 2:48:37| I believe I have Mr. Green before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| Sir, if you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| I'm Daniel Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| I live at 2541 Timber Highlands Lane, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10124)|
| 2:48:51| I was going to read something that I wrote last night regarding this, but after listening to everybody, I feel more inclined to talk from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10131)|
| 2:48:59| I work in financial markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| I work in mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| This is not slowing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| Even with the next effort to combat inflation, see higher rates, the demand for houses are not going to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10146)|
| 2:49:13| And even I live in a Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| And I actually think very well of the company, Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| But this area where Ball Homes is wanting to place development, it's a challenging area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| Even with the proposed improvements to the roads, it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| My mother lives a mile, I believe, east out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10170)|
| 2:49:34| I don't even let her leave in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| The challenges we face in this area is the school congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| It's taking people 20 to 30 minutes to get over to Pellissippi, over by the Robinson Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| It's a strong liability, even for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10189)|
| 2:49:54| There have been several court cases over in recent history which show lawsuits by the citizens towards the county governments for lack of future planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10194)|
| 2:50:06| And I commend Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| I commend these other companies for wanting to make an investment into the community and developing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| But I believe more needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| And Commissioner Jay, I hear you, I understand you, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| But I'm just hoping that my comment today, what we're trying to do, places in your minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10223)|
| 2:50:30| That we need to be more proactive in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| It's a give or take, but we need to find that new medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| Commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| Ms. Criswell, if you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| Becca Criswell, Club Car Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| I just wanted to first start out by thanking those of you who voted in favor of the citizens on the last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| That will not be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| It does feel very disheartening to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| It really makes me feel like my voice is not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| What's the point of even reading my speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| But I'm going to go for it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| My name is Becca Criswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| My husband has lived in Hardin Valley for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| And we're now raising our three young children here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| I'm asking that you would please pause on the building of more homes in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| We have many other issues that need attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| For example, currently we are in the parent, my neighborhood is in the parent responsibility zone for getting children to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| And our neighborhood does not have sidewalk access to the schools for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| And this was actually brought up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| And they said this would hopefully happen in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10297)|
| 2:51:40| This neighborhood has been here since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| So the only way for my kids to walk to school is alongside Hardin Valley Road, which we all know is completely unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| And so you may be wondering why I might not just drive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| Well, it takes me 30 minutes to make it through the car line, even though the school is less than half a mile from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| This is because our school is overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| I'm not allowed to come eat lunch with my kids due to the school being overcapacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| I think a lot of us can remember how special that was as a kid to have your parents come do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10325)|
| 2:52:10| My kindergartner sits in a classroom all day every day that doesn't have any windows because it was a teacher's workroom that was converted into a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10330)|
| 2:52:20| The COO of Knox County Schools said in a recent board meeting that if he had access to extra portables, he would send them to Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10340)|
| 2:52:29| There are over 90 schools in Knox County, yet he would send multiple portables to the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10349)|
| 2:52:35| I think we all know that there will be children zoned for a Hardin Valley school and the majority of the homes being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10355)|
| 2:52:41| I understand that the school board has the power to rezone schools, but they are not responsible for approving land rezoning and sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10361)|
| 2:52:49| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Everybody plays a role in this problem and you have power to make decisions that can help alleviate this significant problem now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10370)|
| 2:52:58| There are parks in essentially every community in Knox County, but where is the space for a park in Hardin Valley if we continue to approve building neighborhood after neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10378)|
| 2:53:08| If my three children want to play on a playground, we have to travel 15 to 20 minutes to get to a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10388)|
| 2:53:13| In a community where there are over 2,000 elementary and middle school children, which does not take into account children under five, private or homeschooled children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10393)|
| 2:53:23| locating and building a park for them should be a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| Please consider this in your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| Your decisions do have consequences and the children in this community do matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| Thank you, Ms. Criswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| Mr. Valiant, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| Commissioner Jay's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| He may have a question, but you are more than welcome to respond first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10425)|
| 2:53:49| I think that Ms. Criswell's argument points to one of the things that Commissioner Jay was saying and that we have been pointing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10429)|
| 2:53:59| If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Criswell lives in a ballhomes house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Everybody wants to live in the last house built in a particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| They don't want somebody else to move down the street from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| It's not a practical philosophy to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| We have to keep developing and we have to keep expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| Knox County is growing and it's going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| And I think we have to allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| That's where our tax dollars are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| That's where the schools are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| That's where the roads are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| That's where the infrastructure is being built by the utilities and the utility districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10476)|
| 2:54:43| A lot of the money they're spending isn't necessarily to put in new infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| although I think, as I've said before, that West Knox has put in close to $100 million worth of new infrastructure out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10489)|
| 2:54:58| including a water treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| But there's also decaying infrastructure that's been put in place years and years and years ago that they're having to replace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10501)|
| 2:55:06| and that's part of the cost of the utilities having to replace worn-out infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10506)|
| 2:55:15| So this development, these developments are helping fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| I had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| You mentioned several times fixing West Gallagher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10527)|
| 2:55:33| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| Mr. Snowden or Mr. Sampson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| That's not anywhere in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| First I've heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10541)|
| 2:55:42| You can kind of look at it in aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| You can see that West Gallagher Ferry comes in at a pretty acute angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| It's probably 45 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| We like to see, you know, somewhere between no less than 75, but preferably 90 degrees to essentially come in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10554)|
| 2:56:02| perpendicular with the other road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10562)|
