| 0:03:42| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=222)|

| 0:03:53| Obviously, you can tell Mayor Kincannon's not here with us this evening, so I'll be sitting in here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| The mayor is attending the Bloomberg City Lab in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| This is a three-day event that brings mayors from all across the country together with prominent innovators, business leaders, urban experts, key members of the Biden administration, and others to discuss shared solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=244)|

| 0:04:24| Also, I wanted to talk about something that is going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| There's a lot of discussion about the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| I wanted to address some questions about ambulance situation in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| I know that many council members have asked about how we can fix problems and that this is affecting our residents, as well as our police and fire employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| All of that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Ambulance service impacts all of us, and the current services contracted by Knox County are not meeting the needs of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=287)|
| 0:04:56| Please know that the city administration has and will continue to work with Mayor Jacobs and his leadership team on providing this vital service over the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| Knox County, with input from KPD, KFD, E911, and other city leaders, initiated a professional study that is guiding improvements in a future county contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=305)|
| 0:05:17| Mr. Brace provided each of us with the detailed information and email earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| If you have any questions, either he or Chief Sharp are always available to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| There are also some upcoming events to mark on your calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| There will be, on Thursday, October 19th, we will be holding a promotional ceremony for the ranks of Captain, Lieutenant, and Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=334)|

| 0:05:46| Also, on Wednesday, October 25th, we are officially cutting the ribbon at the new Public Safety Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| The ceremony will be at 4 o'clock outside the main entrance on Heron Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| Members of Council have been invited to join in the celebration and learn more about this investment in the North Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| I also wanted to remind everyone to mark your calendars for October 31st, for another reason other than Halloween,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| when we will be breaking ground on another affordable housing project in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| At 1030 that morning, we will be meeting at 1511 Callahan Drive to celebrate the start of construction on Callahan Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=377)|

| 0:06:31| Again, that's two weeks from today at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=391)|

| 0:07:05| Before we move to council's reports, I wanted to just remind everybody about our rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| Just a quick reminder that those who wish to speak, either to a specific agenda item or during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| should sign up for the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Please do not use profanity when speaking to specific agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Those who fail to adhere to those rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| For those who are listening, please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| Those who do so may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| And I appreciate everyone's, in advance, their respect for these rules as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| That takes us to council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Do I have any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Just one comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Some of you may have seen that K-Town Connect program has expanded to Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| I just want to give thanks to the mayor and the administration for extending that very popular program from downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| to another densely populated part of our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| I know the business owners along Cumberland particularly really appreciate and are excited about that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| I think that started last week-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| It's fall break month, so this month it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| So just really excited to celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| And I had one more kind of question related to the ambulatory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We've all had a lot of questions about it, but it's my understanding that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| or am I right that the city, although we rely on the county to select a provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| the city has an MOU with that provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I'd have to kick this over to David Bray, Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I think Mr. Sharp or Law Director Swanson may jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| We allow them to operate within the city of Knoxville corporate limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| The contracts are all between the county and the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| And so we are evaluating how best to integrate our expectations into an MOU right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| And so we're evaluating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| But essentially what we do is allow them to operate within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| And Chief Sharp, I guess, or Deputy Bray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| would it be fair to expect that a new MOU would be drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| or some type of agreement between the provider that's selected for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| Chief Sharp is working with the law department, with Allison Dyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| and with Mr. Swanson on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| I think, again, the base contract between Knox County and the provider is the overriding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| but our expectations would also be captured in that type of MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=593)|

| 0:10:41| 11B is the resolution recognizing the need for additional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=641)|

| 0:10:53| to address the need for increased housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=653)|

| 0:10:57| I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| We also have some folks that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Speaking for, first we have Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=662)|
| 0:11:16| Welcome, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| My name is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| I live at the Hammond Apartments in Knoxville's District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| So I'm speaking for this resolution, but a bit cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| I appreciate that the Council brought forward this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| and mentioned explicitly in the third paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| that the Knoxville City Council has heard personal stories from many frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Knoxville residents experiencing sudden and dramatic rental increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| which have caused pronounced financial hardship and stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| So I appreciate the Council for formally recognizing what myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| and other folks and people from the Knoxville Area Tenants Union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and from SOCOM have been saying to this body for the past couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| So I think that's a good step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Also, this resolution does also make a call for different bodies to consider options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| that would expand housing developments along our main corridors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| which I think is a positive statement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Of course, personally, I don't feel that this goes far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| but I think this is a good place for you all to start, and I am happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I just want to make clear that what this resolution is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| is not something that does make a material change immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| in the housing inventory that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| and it doesn't create a pathway for the city to formally receive feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| from renters and other members in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| So I'd like to see some more things that you guys can do to hear from us as renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| in places that aren't just the public forum here at the City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| So those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| And then, of course, we would definitely like to see some increase in spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| towards affordable housing and homeless prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| because the dollar is always the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| So, yeah, this is really a nice olive branch, which is very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| but we need a whole grove of olive trees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| So I'm happy that this step is being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| and I hope it's just one step along a long staircase ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Next up is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Nikki Lynn, 4501 Tillery Road, the Rand at Tillery, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| I would also like to speak in favor of this resolution reluctantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| because, as Thomas had said previous, it doesn't have enough teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| is what I like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| It's a great gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| We're very thankful that you're recognizing the elephants that have been in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| the last two-and-a-half months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| but we would have assumed that it would have more teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| given the two-and-a-half months that we've been talking about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| and sharing our stories, and since 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| when this crisis first started hitting the city hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| So we're very thankful that you've acknowledged us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| and that we are looking for solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| but we definitely urge this body to put forth some more solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| with a bit more rapidness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| Also, as Thomas had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| we definitely feel like we need to all be at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| when these conversations start to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| When I say all, I mean myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I mean my neighbor who's a single mother who has to work three jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| and has to insure childcare for her son that's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| I am speaking about my neighbor who works second shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| and has to sleep during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| I'm talking about my elderly neighbor who has difficulty even getting to the bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| that needs to be part of these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| I implore you all to make sure that the following resolutions to this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| will include plans to include everyone during all of their schedule needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| I yield the rest of my time to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| All right, next up we have Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=966)|
| 0:16:15| This resolution is a makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=975)|
| 0:16:24| It's just a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| We've had plans on the board for certain corridor development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| and I'm still not understanding through the years what that really looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| Just from personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| when we were doing the empowerment zone process 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| the thing I heard because I was involved in the ESUM at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| was Magnolia MLK Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and all the resources that would be brought into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| that would be brought to bear in terms of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| It's gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| We had an opportunity to bring in other folks' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| other taxpayers' money into the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| not city of Knoxville or county of Knox tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and we literally did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I mean, we did things and then we brought in a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| We tried to have a library centered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Keep in mind, whatever you guys do, it has an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| and you have to have input from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| because we've got two governments, obviously, for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| They control some vital services and they have to be brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Today, did they not come out with their own Knox County housing needs plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1089)|
| 0:18:20| How much did they consult with you guys on all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| That would be nice to hear you guys discuss this and bring that out in the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| if there were discussions, if there was communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| because continually what's happened is particular communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| have been negatively affected by these Grand Noir plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| and we know what those communities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| If you don't know, come talk to me later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| So you guys cannot control or have never shown a need or an ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1135)|

| 0:19:05| Those are the financial institutions who continue to discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| You guys have no control over those folk, and it's still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Have you all considered what maybe Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| or somebody else that may have some familiarity with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| what effect would the Community Reinvestment Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| since it's now gotten off the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Congress is trying to push resources into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| what effect would that have on this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| That's something to consider because that's a lot of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| that could be brought to bear potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| You've got enough information to show the negative impacts of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| of the City Council and the Knoxville City Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| You've got enough information to show it because you can just walk out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| and you can go east and you can go south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| and you can see the negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| We've already dealt with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| We've spoken about them multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| So in this whole process, it feels good when we read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| You're acknowledging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Yeah, I'm one of those personal stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I've buried my soul a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| I'm trying to connect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I'm trying to connect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I really am trying to connect it here because I just feel like, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| this is just a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| Until you guys start making a commitment in the budget, numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| you'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| You all know the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| You all know the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| You know what the resources are that you can bring to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| So start crunching numbers, just like you crunch numbers for the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| just like you crunch numbers for the new police station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Crunch the numbers and see what you can come up with because the need is apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Next up is Constance Severy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Yes, Constance Severy, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I'm not as apologetic as the housing tenant folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| I think they missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I think they missed the mark on this today because the first thing I want to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| up is the opening line of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| whereas Knoxville is in need of more housing of all types from the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| affordable to market rate as the current supply of housing is not keeping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| with the demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| And we'll pause right there on that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| First off, we have plenty of the market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| What is missing is affordable and middle income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| We're focusing on affordable and middle income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| That's what's missing from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| And, you know, as always, Andrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| what is your name doing on this as this initiative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| When have you advocated for housing, especially affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| homeless housing in any format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| You haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| So this comes off as what it looks like, opportunistic and resume building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Meanwhile, I want to take the time to acknowledge Amelia Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| who received a federal recognition and award for her advocacy for housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| homeless housing, especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| That's who should have been a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| That's who should have wrote the initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| And that's whose pathway you should follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| The one who's actually been federally recognized for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| You have not been recognized, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| So what is your name doing there in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| It's beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Maybe it gives me the same vibe as what it was when you hijacked heart and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| brought in your rich friends, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| the CEOs and those type of folks that you attached immediately to your so-called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| resolution for crisis response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| we'll keep going because of the other piece of this initiative that concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| me is that you're talking about still the corridor development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| which we know about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| That's what the whole issue has been the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Recoding and the reason that you all done that move things like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| affordable housing out of picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| re-labeled as the mixed income usage spaces that have now drove in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| out-of-town developers or more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Randy boys and his friend developers like Tim Hill and those folks instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| who have been allowed to drive the market up to increase outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| affordability of the average working class home, family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| or community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| So this resolution is really babble on paper, but y'all good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Hey, ask Gwen about the a hundred million resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Is that not a babble resolution today? I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| And so this continues to show the issue as Rick wrote said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| y'all can find money for everything else under the sun and sell for the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| of the community. Y'all can find money for the police station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Y'all can find money for the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Y'all just found money for the pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Y'all can find money literally for everything, but this housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| everything, but for poverty, everything, but public transportation, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| I can run a list of things that you all have continued to waste taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| dollars on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| And yet when we come to this podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| we get babble resolutions as your so-called initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| which is really just trash and false hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| And more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| kicking the can down the road because the reality is that we have sat here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| and listened to you all speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Y'all had this middle income housing thing that y'all hosted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| By the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| your boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| your boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Tim Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| who's the director of the board of the planning commission has openly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| admitted to Rick Rose publicly that that idea would never work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| it would never be implemented according to the board director of the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| commission himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| So when you got people like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| send that out loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| what are you really telling us as the public at this point with these type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| resolutions and issues that y'all so claim hosting in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| I'm really been serious when I asked this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I'm trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| where's the 9,000 voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| the white liberals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| the Democrats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| where are you at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Because we need some answers on what you all really call yourself doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And while you continue to select such trash leadership as Andrew Roberto and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| you're not the only one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Andrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| you have a fellow council member center for which you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| who identify the same trash manners you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| So the irony is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| This is how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Cause voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| you put us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| And then the sad part is you're going to continue to ask Amelia Parker to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| bear the weight of this entire council by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| When she deals with jealousy and straight up disrespect from fellow council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| members and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| who's not here for herself tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| literally constantly on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| And the one time that you all should have paused today to applaud her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| like y'all do numerous other people in each other all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| You didn't even do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| So that lets me know that you're disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| You have no true value ship in our voices and our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I don't know why you walk in for being apologetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Cause let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| They played y'all once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| And I will yield my time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| And you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| So see some council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I just wanted to first say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I would like to be added as a co-sponsor to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| I've been talking for a long time about the need for many of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| We've all been talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I do think it is good that we have finally addressed it in a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| form and asking the administration to do some specific work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| I do think one of the things that will maybe have to be looked into is do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| you have to create some redevelopment zones that allow tips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| and any other incentives we can throw at it to incentivize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| just to say that we for a fact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1599)|
| 0:26:50| One is the affordable housing trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I will say as a banker for almost 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| the community reinvestment act is a tool that has been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Banks can invest with investment dollars that then can help be loaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| We're going to be looking at all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| So this is not the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| It is a part of a complex plan that has to be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| But I do know for a fact that there are more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| There are more permits in the pipeline in talking to planning and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| with our CEO, Mr. Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| We have seven residential complexes that are in the pipeline right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| We also in the week of October the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| we set a record with 613 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| So some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| the lag is beginning to the dam is beginning to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And I hope that that means that the production of housing units will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| That was a roundabout thing just to say I wanted to be added as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Council member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I'd like to ask Ben Bentley if he would come to the podium and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| speak briefly to us of the projected housing units that are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| pipeline and what that estimated time frame looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Ben Bentley, 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| So there's a lot of inventory coming online right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Most of it is in large scale development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Some of it is actually along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I know the city of Knoxville for a long time has done a great job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| trying to incentivize these types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| It's really great that we're emphasizing that historic work and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| double down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| In terms of the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| that's something I'm going to have to take a note for and kind of come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| back to the group with because I don't want to give you bad information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| I would say that there are in the thousands under development right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| But you all know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| It takes 24 months to finish a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| and there's usually 12 months on the front end for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| So it's not an issue that can change in terms of the market dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| We're trying to move the needle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| and this discussion is an important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| And then I also would like to be added to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and then also to those who have emailed and called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| I have not been able to get back to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| but just to let you know that I did get this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| but just was not able to respond back before it went to press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| But I do support this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| and at this point it is not the end all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| but it is a piece of the puzzle that gets us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| moves us closer to looking at different options and the support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| So I'd like to point out one thing that I would like to potentially ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| for a friendly amendment on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| and I'd like to call on Mr. Ben Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| On page three of the resolution in section one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| it calls for KCDC and the planning staff to work together to create an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Can you tell me what kind of time that would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and what would go into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| So I know we have done similar types of processes in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| It usually involves creating some kind of committee and working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| It's probably a 12-month process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| and at the rate that government moves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| that's an efficient version of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So the other point that I would make is typically the market is ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| any sort of list that we can create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| So I think we would potentially spend a lot of time creating this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and then I'm not sure how much meaningful impact it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Yeah, I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| And Mr. Roach made comments when he spoke about past inventories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| or lists that have come about the empowerment zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| When I moved here, the empowerment zone projects were in play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| and that included some areas where if there were properties in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| empowerment zone, there were reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| and or waiving of building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| I know in Indianapolis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I lived there for eight years before I came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| and some of those areas there were tax freezes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and different incentives that could be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| So I think the inventorying part is not per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I think it's something that doesn't have to be that targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| So what's another way that you could describe what needs to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| to expand incentives to identify areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| I think it would be wise to lean on some of the existing language that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| have in the city's development priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| I don't, off the top of my head, know how many of them there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| but I looked the other day, and I feel like about nine of the 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| specifically are meant to incentivize corridor development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| like what we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| So some of that language might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| I don't have a specific language to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I disappointed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| No, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I would like to propose an amendment to strike the word inventorying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| because I think it's going to create a lot of unnecessary lag time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| For one thing, Councilman Thomas and I both work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Broadway Corridor Task Force and work with the Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| to identify areas to design charrettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and we didn't go through the process of creating inventories and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| So I think the amendment would be to strike the word for inventorying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| or the word inventorying and say options for identifying corridor areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| currently supported with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| or with current infrastructure to support infill mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| as allowed by the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| In lieu of the word inventorying in Section 1 of Page 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| because I think that's going to add an additional year to what Mr. Bentley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| already described as 24 months once you even say, hey, here's a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| Councilman Thomas, I don't want to speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| but when we worked prior to both of us being on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| when we worked with businesses and property owners along the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| corridor, it wasn't a matter of identifying the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| It was a matter of the will to do things on the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| And at the time, we didn't have recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| And then once we had recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| we just have a lot of property owners that live in other places that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| need somebody to sit down with them and talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| or they need somebody to come by the property and develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| So it's in private hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| and they just aren't interested in doing something with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| or they have a plan that is down the road five, ten plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| So anyway, I made a motion for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| And if anybody wants to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I've got a motion and I've got a second for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| And I do view that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| You know, the intent of using the word inventory was never about any one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| parcel or parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It was really always about analyzing opportunities along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| So thinking about areas, not specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| There's no discussion of a list in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| I think if we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| give ourselves a lot of time to produce a list that will have its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| issues, but also takes up a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| And the intent here is to talk about existing tools that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| raise awareness about this exact same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| because this has been talked about a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| There are examples of success here, but we need to raise it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| And then, like Councilmember Ryder said, get people interested in it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| Get the conversations going, because this is a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| I think it presents us the greatest opportunity to quickly build housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| stock for all income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| So I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| So I accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Law Director, do we need to vote on the amendment since it's on there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| or should we complete the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| You need to go ahead and vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Unless there's debate on the actual amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| So we're going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| So does anyone have comments on or questions about what the language of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Councilperson Ryder, if I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Can you hear me better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I like these new mics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Councilperson Ryder, if I understand you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| you're concerned with the word inventory would slow down the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| and then by the time we got the inventory completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| it could possibly be out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| That's part of the conversation that Mr. Bentley and I had earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| I mean, we don't need an inventory, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Because we know where the variables are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| And they do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| You know it does change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Yeah, I'm supportive of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Any other questions or discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| We've talked about discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| I don't see any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| We are amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| No longer refers to an inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I had other folks who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| I think your time up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Just a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I mean, I go back to, and I think I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| and most everybody concurs that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| this is not an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| It's a multifaceted approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And there have to be a lot of pieces to solving this very complex problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2251)|
| 0:37:41| And, you know, I've long said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| I've been a huge advocate of housing and believe in public-private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| And, you know, there have to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| I look at Charlotte as a great model and have for a lot of years because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| they've gone to a lot of their large employers there, their banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| their hospitals, and they have to be part of the solution as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| I mean, they're recruiting, they're bringing in workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and this is not just a government problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| It's got to be a collective community solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| So to that point, I guess one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I agree with Council Member Ryder and thank you for making that amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| because I do think about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| who of these entities would even have the bandwidth to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| But I do have a question between the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Knoxville-Knox County Planning, KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I mean, now at this point, let's, with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| I presume it passes, then who does the onus fall on to then take charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| and sort of start this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| this analyzation across the city of these properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| I don't know who to toss that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| I'll send it to Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Yeah, thank you very much, Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I think when we worked and had discussions with Vice Mayor Roberto about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| this resolution, what is good about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| and my colleague Ben Bentley reiterated this just a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| is this is much of what we do already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| So if you look at the successes we have had up central along Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| in South Knoxville with the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| the areas where we have good planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| we have the tools in place and the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| we oftentimes see new investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| And so, again, these are efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I had a good meeting with Councilwoman McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| about how do we start to look at these tools all the way down Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| from First Creek at Austin all the way down to Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| How does that start to be planned and the infrastructure continued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| And when that happens, we see the market interest in developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| along those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| So, again, I think this is work that is in kind of a group of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| I see Mr. Hanson Sayle was here previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| So the Realtors, KCDC, the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| the Mayor had a briefing from Mr. Odom in the Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| the work that Grant does as a Chamber board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| that Rebecca Jane does in her role, Cheryl, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| So it's a real team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| So I think we will continue to enhance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I should have mentioned Kevin DuBose and his work in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| So this will be continued work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So we will continue to analyze these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I know that Magnolia right now is an area that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| as we start to look at that infrastructure east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Central and Broadway, Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| So we will continue to do that work, and it will be a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Okay, I mean, yeah, just noted, I mean, going through the corridors too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| I mean, that's often too your highest real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| So, again, it becomes, you know, it's got to be economically feasible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| So it's just, again, a lot of pieces moving in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| but at the same time definitely multifaceted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| I'm fighting to add my name as well as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| But, yeah, I think right step forward, but there are a lot of steps still to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2478)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I was happy to co-sponsor this resolution, but also have some concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2494)|
| 0:41:44| especially along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| I imagine there will be additional obstacles, additional expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| additional barriers that limit development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| and that's one reason why we need incentive programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| But that makes it more likely that market rate would be the go-to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and we desperately need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| I think that as this moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| and if there are incentive programs that are established by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| or if something comes back before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| we would have an opportunity to weigh in on what types of projects qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| for these incentive programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| But that is my one concern is that market rate will be easier to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| along the corridors than affordable housing will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I did have a question for Mr. Bentley, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| Just based on the conversation earlier about number of affordable housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| I do appreciate you following up and sending us that info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| I wanted to clarify one thing because I continue to hear thousands of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| thousands of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| But when I look at KCDC website and I look at the housing report from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| I'm not seeing thousands of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| I know we have other programs, but just within KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| when we're looking at public housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| when we're looking at the low-income housing tax credits, the vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| all the various programs that KCDC has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| what I'm seeing is that at the end of July 2020 we had 7,698 of those units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| and then one year later we had 23 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| What are the plans and the capacity of KCDC to address the shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| or the need we have for units at this income range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| We are one very important piece to that puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| A couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Do I have an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| How much time do I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| In terms of our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| there will be a net increase based on First Creek at Austin and at Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| These are long-term processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| but the net increase to publicly owned housing inventory in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| is about 650 to 700 between those two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| We don't have the capital to do everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| so we also rely on joint ventures with, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Elmington Capital, Dominion Affordable Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| There's LHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| There's a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| In the last three years, through those joint ventures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| we've created about 500 other units that have public ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| So at the end of the tax credit period, KCDC will have the ability to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and potentially, assuming that we continue to be managed and financially strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| make an acquisition to keep those properties affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| The public ownership stake of those assets is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| So that would be Young High Flats, Pond Gap, and Moss Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| which is kind of Cedar Bluffish area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| We're continuing to build on those partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| So there's one right now that's going to be kind of across from Holston River Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| that we're trying to partner with Dominion to get something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| in terms of affordable units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| There's one in the north part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| So these are happening, and they're continuing to grow the inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| but it takes too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| We want to do it faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| And so those specific projects do not show up in these annual reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| The reason that they don't, those are managed by the other partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| but we have, through the financing structure, created public ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| and our intention is at the end of the affordability period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| to make an acquisition or at least attempt to acquire those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| for perpetual public ownership and preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Do we have, whether through the city or KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| any sort of landing page that tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| what are the various affordable housing projects in the city, all in one place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| That would be extremely useful, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| for both for city council to know what we have and what's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| but also for the public to know as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Okay, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| You led right into one of my questions, Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Mr. DuBose, I think some of what has been drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| from our recent conversation is the affordable housing fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| or actual dollars we contribute, but we also enable a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| Obviously, we enable KCDC housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| We enable subsidies for a percentage of private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| so that folks can rent wherever they want to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| as part of multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| We have some of those numbers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Do you have them on hand in terms of what we've funded versus enabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| and kind of a macro-level view of the housing supply that the city has funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Yes, and Kevin DuBose, Housing and Neighborhood Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| I'll try to be brief as our team can attest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| I can really nerd out on some of the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| But a couple of points I would like to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| is there are over 4,000 units currently being supported by tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| I think the number is 4,081 low-income housing supported by pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2873)|
| 0:48:02| It's nearly five times the number of market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| That's something I haven't really heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| In terms of what's happening now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I will reiterate what Mr. Bentley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| We're experiencing a boom, a lot of development since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| The city has invested in over 2,100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| Now half of those have opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| The other half are under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| through the affordable housing fund that you created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I have those numbers. I have them by council district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| It's pretty evenly distributed in terms of where we're investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| In addition to that, a growing issue while we're building new housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| is that investors are targeting older complexes and flipping those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2937)|
| 0:49:07| We have been trying to prevent that from happening when appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| There are some older complexes that we've been able to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| and help keep them affordable through our rental rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| There's about another 400 units of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Combined both through the affordable housing fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| and through the federal rental rehab program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| about 2,500 units since 2019 that we've partnered on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| Again, about half of those are opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| I do think the problem is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| I do believe our response as a city team has been robust as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| We do have some work to do ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you. Just a couple more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Currently we have incentives as part of pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| One of those is one of our tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I think there are 13 priorities, Deputy Brace or Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| The pilots, I think there are 13 priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| and one of those is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| It is one of the criteria for what gets a city-funded subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| It's already one of the main priorities for subsidy from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| I would jump in, too, that remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| and Mr. Bentley or Kevin DuBose can jump on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| but you see all the market rate pilots come in where we push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| for a percentage of workforce or affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| The automatic pilots that go for our LIHTCs, those happen automatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| and I think we need to continue to report those to members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| and the public more routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| So I know the mayor has said, hey, all of those automatic pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| that council doesn't see because they happen automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| through a system that's in place for any affordable project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| that comes in with certain guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| we're going to start reporting on those regularly during mayor's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| and as we roll out some of our newer programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| that we're looking at over the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I want to thank council for the discussion we've had revolving around housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| I also want to have us thinking about into next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| when we're thinking about potential workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| potentially a housing workshop would be a good approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| to bring this back up again and see where we are at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| This resolution came from a collaborative effort with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| mayor's staff, with our other city staff, with private sector folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3114)|
| 0:52:04| because I think it's going to take all of us working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| to see development along the corridors realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| where we can build more housing faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| we can use our incentive programs that we currently have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| to build in workforce housing as we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| and be supportive of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| So anyway, I just wanted to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| and I do think just having this discussion and highlighting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| just raises awareness about these options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| about the intent of council and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| to look into mixed use along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and about the infrastructure we have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| about the incentive programs we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| and maybe we develop new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| maybe we come up with new outreach techniques,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| but all of those are a part of what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Council Member Smith, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Just two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| I ran out of time, so I wanted to honor a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| One is you can please add me as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I didn't have time to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| The second is I just want to make a comment about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| I think that we've all said a number of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| we can't add it fast enough, we need to add it everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| and this is one of the pieces of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| So I think we're all on the same page about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| The speed at which we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| we all would like to add as much money as possible to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| It's the number one priority in our city at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| That voice has been loud and clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and we all should respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I do want to be clear that where possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| we need to also make sure that we allow these types of incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| in residential neighborhoods where renters live and want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| So this is about the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| That's fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I thought about making an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| but it was too messy to be friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| It doesn't have to be friendly, but it was too messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| So I may bring something soon about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| But I do think I would encourage us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| as we make all the progress we can on missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| housing in the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| that we don't unintentionally exclude residential incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| because there's blighted houses that owners are vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| or there are people that own properties in residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| that would be happy to take a subsidy if that was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| So I would encourage us to get creative around incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| within residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I think we'll maybe come back before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| but Giffen Elementary School in South Knoxville is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| registered as a historic place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and it's also going to be 100% rental units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| and all will be subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| So that's a great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| The South Haven neighborhood is exactly where people want to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| but may not be able to afford and where we can provide incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We need to get creative within the interior of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Yes, we can go through zoning changes or design standard changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| but people want to live where everybody wants to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and to the extent they can rent there, we should make that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| So I just don't want to lose sight of interior residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| and the desire for everyone to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Corridors are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| All the other places are great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| but everybody deserves to live wherever possible that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| All right, I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| All right, seeing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Mr. Johnson, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| for the provision of administrative services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| for the city's self-funded employee medical program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| at an estimated annual cost of $774,816.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Seeing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3357)|

| 0:59:01| I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Just in looking at this, along the Woodland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and those residences, and it talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| about construction of final plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| may vary by up to 20% depending on field conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| and plans revisions made after meeting with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| What if property owners don't comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| or don't want to comply with the proposed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| Under those circumstances, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| exercise the right of condemnation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| should we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| We put the additional money into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| so that our folks who go out and negotiate for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| can go ahead and negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| We don't have to come back to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| to get some very small difference in the figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| approved by you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| But should it happen that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| are unable to reach an agreement within a price range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| that our appraisers say is a reasonable price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| to pay for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| then we would have to exercise the right of condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I just wanted to point that out for public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Mr. Clabo, the drawings are a little technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| So what all do you guys plan to acquire in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| just for public discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| So it's basically, there's a little bit of right away in fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| There's a lot of temporary construction easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| and slope easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| So when you get in these corridors that are tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| and we're trying to add sidewalks or shared use paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| or bike lanes, we have to widen the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| And typically, that means creating a benched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| And in this case, we're going to have to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| in order to get that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| So we have to encroach on a lot of properties to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| But how much are you encroaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| like five feet, three feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Well, I mean, the typical out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| is two 11-foot travel lanes, five-foot bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| and five-foot sidewalks for the majority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| So the existing roadway out there is two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I think it's got sidewalk on one side for the majority of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Yeah, there's sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| So you're probably talking 10 feet to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| From both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| From one side, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| From one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| The plans show kind of the touchdown point of the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| but there are no total takes or really what I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| severe impact to those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| It's mainly getting enough room to get the width we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| to get the amenities in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| I appreciate this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and that area there is really due for a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| And it's not even that friendly actually for automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| You've got the barrier between the lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| and you can't turn around very easy if you want to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| the Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| And then the added negative aspect is it's not friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| to the kids at Fulton High School to get across that four-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| or to ride bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| The First Creek Greenway is not a good connection at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| So I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| This can be really a good redo and make this all pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| friendly, and actually for someone who drives in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| and bikes as well, it's not that friendly for automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| So I appreciate the attention on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and I look forward to solving more than one problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3780)|

| 1:05:05| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Mr. Clabo, I know this is about a process for consultant selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| but what all do we end up doing with Federal Highway Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| We get TDOT funds for all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Greenways, local streets, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| But what do we use Federal Highway funds for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| A lot of those funds, they come through the Federal Highway and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| administered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| So like our gas tax that comes back through, it's administered by TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| and through our Transportation Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| So when we're talking about federally funded projects, that funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| coming through Federal Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| But just to clarify so people know, because I've had people ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| our engineering department maintains local streets, sidewalks and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| but we don't maintain the interstates that are within our boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Do we do some pothole patching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Not on interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| We do some on state routes, but typically state routes are maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| So we're not receiving funds for that and not doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Just wanted to clarify because some people think that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and when are you going to hurry up and get your project done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=3986)|

| 1:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| So fleet's purchasing a lot of EVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| We're excited for it, but we're woefully underported, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| We don't have enough plugs to be able to account for all the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| in order, so it's been a project that council approved in a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| two fiscal years ago, and we've been working through design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4064)|

| 1:07:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| And that's because we're swapping out gas vehicles for electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4078)|

| 1:13:34| but who make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| And those are the financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| If they continue to act as they have acted in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| then all your efforts will be for naught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| So I don't know what counsel you keep with these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| I've been in some of their presence, and it ain't fun because they don't listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| because they don't have to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Let's not play games on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4447)|

| 1:14:16| And that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| And when we play their game, they win because they make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4459)|
| 1:14:28| Until you hold them accountable, okay, if you want to have some vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| of what that means, then look at the ones who have violated for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| been caught, and nothing's been done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Okay, they might enter into a consent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| A consent decree means you did something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| and this is your way of making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Keep that in mind when you go and focus on these institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and the outside money coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4498)|

| 1:15:39| as far as housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| It's been an issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| And the biggest thing was really finding solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| and trying to figure out what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| and what we can do to help my neighbors that are getting kicked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| that don't know where they're going to be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| For my end, I did what I needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| I was lucky enough to close on a home today, so that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| I'm getting to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| But at the same time, we have to figure out how to help everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| The housing crisis, of course, people are moving to Knoxville now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| so it's becoming harder and harder to get a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| But also at the same time, we have to battle investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| I've lost so many homes to cash investors that bought the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| So on that front, I wanted to talk about short-term rentals and Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| I work in the vacation rental industry, not in Knoxville remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| And we know that there's close to 1,000 Airbnbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| and only 300 of them have been approved by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| And I don't think it's very hard to track that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| because they're all listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| It's on Airbnb, and there's different tools where you can go and look up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| and figure out who is renting the Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| because they have it listed on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| So I'm pushing the city to maybe find a way to kind of regulate that industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| because it could get out of control the more homes they buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and the more investors take away houses from residents that are trying to find a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| So that's one of the things I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| The next, and I do appreciate the changes in the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| to allow more housing to be built in the city for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| At the same time, we want to look at funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| and see if we can get more money towards housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Now that it's a crisis moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| I understand some of the investment in the stadium, in the new baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| That's already too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| On Friday, I went to talk to the UT University of Tennessee Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| And this was really about on the rental industry side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| for people that are still wanting to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| What's causing rentals to go up is the amount of students that are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| I think the university went from historically being at 22,000 students to 36,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| And that's about 14,000 more people in the city that need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| And that's what I wanted to talk to them about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| They had an $80 million profit this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| And it's really, hey, the more students you bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| you do have to provide housing as you're growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| So that's something I wanted to talk to them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| and come here to talk about the pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| I know we raised $20 million towards the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| but it's going to cost about $50 to $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| And this is a university that spent $340 million to renovate Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| And I believe they have funds to pay for that project themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| Now that we're in the city and the residents are in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| we should be saying no to giving more money to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| and maybe helping the people that need housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| So those are the two aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| These are the things I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| The housing, in terms of people trying to buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| and the people that are trying to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| If there's any way to slow down the growth of the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| because the more students you bring, that's going to cause an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| And also what's the quality of the education in classrooms that are packed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| and what is the capacity for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| So those are the questions I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| I believe everyone knows where I live now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| So I wanted to mention a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| First, congratulations, Amelia, from myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| and from all my neighbors at Tanglewood and from the Knoxville Area Tenants Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| We're very proud of you and the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Second of all, I'm not sure that everyone in the council is aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| but CATU, SOCCM, Sleeves for Needs, PSA, and AMAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| are hosting a housing and homelessness candidate forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| So when we're talking about coming to the table and listening to folks' stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| and meeting your constituents where they are, this is a perfect opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| whether you're running for office or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| There will be people in the communities that you serve that have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| Maybe we're not asking you the direct questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| but they're definitely questions we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| So I urge any and all of you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| It will be October 26th at 7 p.m. at St. Luke's Episcopal Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| It's 600 South Chestnut Street, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| Lastly, again, we reluctantly supported the 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4865)|
| 1:21:15| Again, we need to see solutions listed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| As Tom said earlier, we'll be here in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| Two weeks from now, I think you guys can call me on the bluff at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| We're going to keep showing up until things are getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| So don't expect that this resolution has passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| and the pressure is going to come off because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Things need to happen, and they need to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| So I appreciate the friendly amendment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| But there are solutions that aren't listed in that resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| and also just reiterating, hey, we're doing something about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| but really we've always been doing these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| and nothing's really innovative in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| So I urge you in the next two weeks to think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| and get in those trenches and do some digging and some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| If you've got questions, you are always free to contact me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| and I can give you that information after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| But, yeah, that's kind of the things that I wanted to put out on the table in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4950)|
| 1:23:00| Mr. Giusetta, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I'm back again with the Bilo store and the fire that was blamed on India McDowell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| and nobody burned it but the fire department, and they know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| The last time I was here, I asked for Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Mark Reno is an escape goat that the government is using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| I've got pictures of the gas valves that the government, exactly which one, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| whether it was the city, the state, or any other government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| but I do know that the building, the new addition, was burned, other than Mark Reno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5019)|
| 1:23:49| Here is a picture of a gas valve that's in the rafters in the new addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| Here is the new addition of Planned Parenthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and these devices that were used on Bilo, the store that the Palestinian storekeeper owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5043)|
| 1:24:11| as my father's store, a Palestinian, both stores were burned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| I don't believe the city does that to every storekeeper in the city, but we happen to be Palestinian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| I came here crawling because that's how much I believe of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| Here's another picture of the gas valve is what I call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| Here's another picture. Here's three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| Here's three of them lit, and where did I get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| From an Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Anybody can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| You just have to look for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| When you see Bilo, you'll understand what to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| Here's another one. It's a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| And here's a device that's hid behind glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| Apparently, as one of the fire captains stated, it was an experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| You put it behind glass, and you light it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Once it's lit, it will amplify heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5116)|

| 1:25:27| I'm going to leave these here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| Somebody's serious about Planned Parenthood, and you might ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| why would the government burn Planned Parenthood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It's because of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| The country cannot afford to keep putting money out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| and the federal government gave it to the states to handle this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| around $600 million or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| It was up to the states, each individual state, to take care of it as they saw fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| Nobody burned that building but the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Which one, I don't know, but I do know that the fire department knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| that I'm telling it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| Here's a picture of the rafters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| And what you got here are devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| That's not just fire, as we all would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Normally, in a normal state of mind, before Bilo, a person just sees fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5183)|
| 1:26:35| But when you see Bilo, this is the walk-in cooler of Bilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| This is a camera that was put inside the cooler of Bilo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| and a device, two of them, stacked upon each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| all the doors inside the cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| And Stan, the fire department, and the fire chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| everybody that knows the story knows I'm telling it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| And Planned Parenthood needs an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5222)|

| 1:27:14| The land was never turned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| It was only a year old, a year and a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| The grass was lush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| It was just a headstone with nobody under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| Here's a picture off the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231017?start=5246)|
