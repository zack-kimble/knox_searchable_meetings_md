| 0:17:57| There is traditional neighborhood and town center mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| The majority of the property has the traditional neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| And for traditional neighborhood, it's for areas that feature a mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| of housing units ranging from single family to townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| and small multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| The town center mixed use obviously expands even more than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| the residential component, but it's appropriate for large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| and compact walkable developments, including commercial and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| various housing mix in there, including the multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| attached residential such as duplex, multiplexes, and townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| Prior to the amendment to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| or the comprehensive land use and transportation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| this property had a sector plan map designation of LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1130)|

| 0:19:14| that are allowed under the PR and within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| For rezoning considerations, as you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| consider a few different components or requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| under our Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| First of those is the change of conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| For this area, there have been TDOT improvements on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| These TDOT improvements also include a part of Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| and Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Other change in conditions are recent rezonings in the admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| vicinity on adjacent properties on this side of Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and on the opposite side of Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| There's a 117 lot townhome development at a density of 9.46| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| dwelling units per acre, 64 acres rezoned to PR at 2.8 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1201)|

| 0:20:11| and then a planned residential rezoning on 8.7 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| to planned residential at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| The next requirement is that the rezoning request consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The planned residential zoning ordinance is designed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| implemented to provide various optional development types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| development patterns that offer different methods to take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| account, whether it's hillside, whether there's stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| protection issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1246)|

| 0:20:56| in adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| As noted in the staff report, the PR zoning requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| development plan approval, and that process is when this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| this commission, reviews and considers the potential impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Finally, the request should be consistent with the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| land use plan and adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| The staff confirms in the report that the request of PR at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| dwelling units per acre is consistent with the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| policy plan, and staff also confirms that the request of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| rezoning is, or that the rezoning request is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| with the comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| So staff comments, notably they identify the two issues for why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| they recommended a reduced density of two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| per acre, and that's the hillside on the property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| that there's the access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Although there are three access points, two of the roads may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| need some improvements to widen those to provide suitable access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| at the requested density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| We recognize that there's significant hillside issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| concerns with the capacity of Evans and White School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Obviously, understanding these conditions will impact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| density of the potential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| What's uncertain at this time is what overall resulting density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| can this development support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| When I say overall resulting density that this can support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I'm not saying physically it can build on, what I mean is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| you take into account the engineering and the design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| the process you go through with determining is it single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| is it townhomes, multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Councillor, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Taking in all those various, and I'll just conclude real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| all those various components come through the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| process, plan process, and control ultimately what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| viable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| We'd ask that you approve the recommendation as applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| three dwelling units per acre to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I have signed up today on this item a Margie Grace and a Don| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| Hi, I'm Don Close, a person that lives in the community, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| representing the other people from the Dry Hollow community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| So there's a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| You know, we're not a no to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| We are a no to overdevelopment or things that are kind of unwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| And one of the things is the cumulative effect of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| these, you know, projects that are approved, you know, recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| approved or, you know, are in the pipeline, when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| them as a group, it's pretty significant the impact this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| having on the community and will have on the community moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So for us, we have a real genuine concern about Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Highway and the overcrowding already on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And if you look at the projects that have recently been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| completed, ones that are underway, and the ones that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| proposed, you're looking at about 1,200 homes in a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| community, a rural community, away from a lot of the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| So on this particular project that they're proposing, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| know, they've approved two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| One of the things that they've done on some of their other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| projects is they propose to do clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So what I know is they're not going to build on that hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| There's a front part of the property that all the soil from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| the road work has been brought, grading has been done, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| they're going to want to do their construction just on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| They're not going to do it on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| And so there's really going to be one entrance and one exit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Even though White School Road has an entrance from that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| it doesn't go to those houses where it's going to actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| So the clustering is a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| It takes something that's, you know, two per acre is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| offensive for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| But when it starts to become clustered and it becomes six or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| seven per acre, this is really an impact on the community, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| way that it looks, the way that it feels, and, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| amount of traffic and all of the other, you know, components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| So we're okay with the two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| We wish it was less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| But, you know, they have rights too as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| It says on the staff recommendations, unless approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| by planning commission from conditions number two, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| like that removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And we would also really strongly oppose anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| has to do with clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I don't know, you know, which body takes care of which thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| But the clustering is what has the community up in arms because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| that takes away from the rural feel and turns it into, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| know, a super subdivision and an eyesore for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| And, you know, nothing is being looked at as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| You know, they're now proposing to rezone the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| You know, there's a lease that was signed last year that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| ballpark would stay a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Now that's they've postponed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| This will be in the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| But that ballpark sits right in front of and is in the center of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| They want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| They want to take it from a park and turn it into commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Again, the community is in an uproar over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| And at the next meeting, there's going to be a lot of people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| as it relates to that ballpark because that's something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| been in the community for many decades, and it's now going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| pulled for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| They would not be asking for commercial rezoning if they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| intend on developing it as commercial and getting rid of the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| So please consider the things that we're asking, you know, a no to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| the, please remove the number two condition and no clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| And be careful about rezoning that ballpark because the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| is in an uproar over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| As she stated, she was going to speak for all the opposition, but I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| have Margie Grace signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Was there anybody else here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| You're going to need to approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| She's used up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Did you have anything else that you needed to add that was different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| than what she said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| I already signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Do you want me to sign it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| No, just hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| That's all I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Could you state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| It's Stacy Brian Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| I live in South Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| The environmental impact on this is going to be outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| As she was speaking, clustering, what they end up doing is sticking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| them all in one corner and then come back later on and move in houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| The backside of that hill is full of trees and forests and animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| So this is what we're really here for is about the impact on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| It's not overcrowding because you guys will take care of that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| forcing us to invest in roads and schools and bigger dumps and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| The environmental impact is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Literally everyone in here is talking about the environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| So that's really all I have to say to add that into what you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| adding to is what the deer, the bear, and everything that we're finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| in Walmart and our neighborhoods, this is what the impact is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| So that's all I have for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| If I may, I think that this is, I understand the concerns of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1803)|
| 0:30:16| and I agree that I really hope that the slopes and the wooded areas do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| not get developed when they go to make the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| But I think that I just want to point out for the applicant as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| move into planning that the best way to do that is by clustering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| development into areas and minimizing the breadth of what gets disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| So if we want to preserve the hillside and trees and the rural aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| and the ecology, we don't want to cut it all up, add a bunch of roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| and crisscrossing through there and parcel every square inch of it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| It is much better if all of that is consolidated into the smallest amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| So just for the applicant, I hope that when we see a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| on this, I really hope to see a lot of wildlife and natural area preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Commissioner Matus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I also want to add that in order to do any kind of further development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| past the 2DUA, they would have to go back before planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| to get any kind of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I know there was a comment made about further development of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| property once this happens, and that won't be the case unless we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| more public opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Given that, I guess I'd like to go ahead and put a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| the PR plan residential zone up to two dwelling units per acre because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| it's consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan and surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| development subject to the two conditions per red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Okay, we have a motion and a second, and I still have a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| or two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| I just wanted to point out, too, yeah, I totally agree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| Higgins and Commissioner Matus regarding the hillside and ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| I mean, I think that's a big part of what the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| is trying to do is keep everybody off of that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| I did want to point out, too, that we just passed the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Comprehensive Plan, and this whole area, it's under traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| neighborhood, which is, by design, leans more towards a heavier density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| than a lot of other zonings and placeholders out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| My opinion, two units is low, given the traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| They got voted in like that because it is close to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| It is close to Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| There are a lot of commercial things close to it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| So, I mean, I agree that we need to stay off of the hillside, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| just a zoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| They'll have to come back through with a development plan as well as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Then we'll really know what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So it could be three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| However, that's not necessarily meaning it's going to get developed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| three units an acre, and we won't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So I would suggest to the applicant, bring us a good plan at the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| stage, and maybe it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Maybe it does not get approved, depending on how good your plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| But I would personally be, I think the Comprehensive Plan calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| higher than two units an acre, so I would be, I'm very comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| the three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Commissioner Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I've got a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Maybe a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Mr. Reynolds, the second condition that some of the neighbors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| discussing, is that our standard kind of hillside protection condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| that it shall not exceed its budget unless approved by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| commission at the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Is that what that condition means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| I can't say we have much of a standard condition for hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| We usually do leave it to the development plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I think with this particular case, I was concerned about the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| steep slopes on this property and that the recommendation be pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| well held to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Now, the staff recommendation does give that opportunity for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| planning commission to approve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| My expectation, if that was the case, it would be kind of a rare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| situation and maybe go over a little bit if it really needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| But hopefully the intent there is to stay within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I don't know if that answers your question, but that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| I guess that was going to be my concern or my point, was that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| hate to see a concept plan come before this body that goes over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| budget any amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| I guess it was a small negligible amount, but I don't want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| something kind of get pushed through that drastically changes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| hillside disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Additionally, it being on Chapman Highway, this topography is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| unique, but in general, most of Chapman Highway could support some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| denser development and maybe two and a half, three could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| Mr. Hubert, you're last still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| I just had a follow-up question, I guess, and if I could ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| applicant with respect to the condition that has just been talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| about, it's worded a little bit differently, I guess, than what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| used to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Is that something you're comfortable with, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I have our engineer, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| The condition is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| There's a little bit of ambiguity, a little bit, because we don't intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| on being on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| We don't want to disturb what's around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| It's economically not as feasible to be up there when you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| at putting roads and different things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| So I'm not, I read it one way and I'm okay, and then I read it another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| way and it looks a little restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| How far up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| You know, if you go up 20 feet, 30 feet into that area, you kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| start to get into that with a slope or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| So it does lend itself to a little ambiguity from a designer standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Yeah, I'll just say that the way the slope analysis land disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| recommendation works is that you get a total budget and you can disturb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| anything within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| So it doesn't matter if it's 0 to 15 percent slopes or 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| or above slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| As long as you stay under that land disturbance limitation within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| the hillside protection area, then you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| So it's not broken out by the individual slope categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| We can make that work, but, you know, it's just, again, we intend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| being as flat a ground as possible and leaving most of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| as very undisturbed because it's a benefit to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Well, thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| And hopefully that alleviates some of the environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and questions that the neighbors have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I just wanted to add, I do think that three units an acre could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| I think the concern is that of the neighbors, that the whole property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| would get chopped up and all the trees cut down and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| So I think maybe if we had stronger language kind of enforcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| the lack of disturbance, maybe even more strong, I think that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| be in support of three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| But I think making sure that we're protecting as much of that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| possible is the importance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I agree with a lot of Commissioner Huber's comments, especially because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| this request for rezoning is consistent with the comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| I think more important than that is the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| gives the developer the flexibility to kind of maneuver around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| such a tough site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| I mean, this is a tough site regarding the contour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| I think everybody up here is respectful of protecting the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| In my opinion, the three dwelling units per acre would be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| So as I read the conditions of the recommendation, it obviously says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| no clearing until development plan is approved by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| And number two, it says that, as Mike pointed out, you've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| respect that budgeted amount in the hillside unless something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| differently is approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| So I think those safeguards are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| I did not hear a formal request to do a friendly amendment to Mrs. Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| So right now we have a motion to second to approve the two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Is that what you're wanting to go with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| So we're going to do this that way, and if the motion fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| then we can pick it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Sounds like the noes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| So I believe that motion would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| So I will now take another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| I would like a motion that we approve planned residential up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| three dwelling units an acre because it is consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Knoxville or Knox-Knox County Comprehensive Plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Surrounding Development subject to the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And speaking to Mr. Higgins, I did reread the slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| side, and it sounds like, looks like 80% of that hillside can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| be touched either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| So I think that's, I think that's sufficient to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2480)|
| 0:41:31| Second by Commissioner Leveson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I know you always want to get on the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| So we have a motion and a second to approve for three per the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2507)|

| 0:42:33| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2557)|

| 0:42:52| Is there any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| So it looks to me like we have three or four people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2584)|

| 0:43:29| My name is Robert Dykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I live at 7544 Galliant Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| I'm here today speaking on behalf of the South Doyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| And we recognize that new homes are needed and we believe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2621)|

| 0:43:49| We believe a lower density would encourage development of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2629)|

| 0:44:01| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| The request for higher density is made by the developer, not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Per the developer, D.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Horton, this project requires five or maybe four units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| acre to be profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| We believe, although we've seen no concept, we worry that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| is some move to obtain the density and then submit a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Regardless of whatever rules or guidelines, whether it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| sector plan or the comprehensive plan, we believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| consideration should be given to the residents that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| already invested and living in the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| A planned growth area doesn't automatically equate to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| maximum growth density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| It's hard to imagine that an arbitrary line drawn down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| middle of the creek, Stock Creek in this case, should reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| separate density that is one acre from density that's four or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2697)|

| 0:45:03| transition density and more consistent with the character of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And the issue here isn't whether it's the sector plan or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| The recommendation by staff for two is appropriate for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| reasons they state in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| The recommendation respects the right of the property owner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| sell their property to this developer or another developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| and respects the interest and investments of the current and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| future community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Within three miles of this property, there are already six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| developments with hundreds of homes built or planned and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| all have a density of five or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| No, I'm sorry, up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| What are the concerns of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| There are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| One is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| A recent traffic count performed on Tipton Station Road indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| an average daily trip count of approximately 1,300 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| As someone who lives on Tipton Station Road, this seems very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| This road serves as a major feeder route for Bonnie Kate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Elementary and for South Doyle High School as well as a bypass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| for the heavy traffic, afternoon traffic on Governor John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Suffice it to say, this narrow and winding country road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| already very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| For the requested 430 home density or something less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| that, an estimated additional traffic count is over 3,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Mr. Dobson, you've got about two minutes left here and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| for your group, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| So there's five minutes total to speak and you're getting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| within two minutes left to speak, so you've got other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I want to talk fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Needless to say, Tipton Station Road isn't equipped to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| that kind of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Next is the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| The Stock Creek Watershed has been designated by TDEC as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| impaired waterway because of bacteria and sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| To add 85 acres with drainage into the creek would put it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2824)|
| 0:47:14| danger and densely packing them would be a serious negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| impact on the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| Third, the community, the people who live in this community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| adjoin the 13 people that adjoin this property, they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| long-time residents and some are fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| They've invested their lives, their resources and efforts into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| the families and homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| They understand the real impact that this would have on them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| So what is it that we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| We would ideally want nothing changed, but we know that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| We accept that more people want to live in our area and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| fine with that and they are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| We recognize that planned residential is not a bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| However, the nature of this property, the watershed, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| traffic and the other factors would indicate that a density of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| four or five is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Therefore, we ask the commission to consider a change to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| zoning with a density of one to no more than two as recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| So I still have two more folks signed up to speak with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2904)|
| 0:48:32| addition of Brian Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| So there's three left that I showed to speak and we have 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| So how does the commission feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| A minute apiece for each is what the commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| recommending and I'm showing Doug Carter is the next person to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| speak if that person is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| Doug Carter, 7730 Goddard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Our property joins this property on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| My wife and I moved here in 2021 from the Atlanta area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| We moved on the south side of Atlanta, which was similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| the south side of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| It wasn't the desirable place to live, so to speak, as the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| But we moved there when we got married and we lived there 37| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| years and we saw the massive growth that occurred with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| high density housing that went from a quiet community like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| south Knoxville into a gridlocked, chaotic town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| If you've ever been down 75 and you went through McDonough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Georgia, you know that it's gridlocked there for no good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| reason, just mass population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| And I had a whole thing set up here to illustrate that, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=2995)|
| 0:50:05| just respectfully ask that you look out for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| We're counting on you to represent our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| We're just common folks that can't afford lawyers to fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| for us, so we're just asking that you respectfully protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| our community and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Andy Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| I've also been appointed by the South Doyle Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Association to speak on behalf of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| There is a perception among south Knox County residents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| these downtown governmental bodies are not responsive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| their concerns, and I think that that perception was a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| the role, a substantial factor in my victory as the Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| or in the Republican primary, and I'm now the Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| candidate for Knox County Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| And so when I was thinking about my remarks today, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| you know, this is very similar in some respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| This is similar to the Hill Locust Project, which is before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| this body with the DRB, and some very prominent people spoke in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| opposition to that project, Bill Lyon, Judge McMillan, Josh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Wright, the chairman of the DRB, and this body was responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| Now, we have people in south Knox County who are expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| They're concerned about the scope is too big for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| it's going to be aesthetically unappealing, and it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| bring too much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Exact same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Is this body going to be as responsive to the concerns of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| those who are not connected politically to those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3101)|

| 0:52:50| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| This total tract that the applicant is purchasing is 155.71 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| only 85.81 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| The portion in the planned growth area, which is north of Stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3183)|

| 0:53:09| It's not an arbitrary line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| We're following the planned growth area map to decide what area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| we wanted to ask for rezoning for PR, and our request was five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3198)|

| 0:53:23| little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3203)|

| 0:53:28| hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| It's, you know, very steep, beautiful property, and if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| applicant is able to move forward with this project, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| committed to dedicating those 70 acres into a conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| easement, so it will not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| It will remain that way in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| If we do not move forward with this property, then someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| comes in and they're restricted to two units an acre probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| would want to push development back onto those back acres, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| there's an opportunity to put the development where the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| say the development should be and preserve the acreage that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| back behind it that is more environmentally sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| And when you talk about the plans that are there, this is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| the planned growth area, which allows considerations up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| It was in the planned growth area under the old plan that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| in place since 2001, and it remained in the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| area moving forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| It's about 1,700 feet west of Tipton Station Road's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| intersection with West Martin Mill Pike, and that intersection, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| the residents will tell you, is a little tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| And at four units an acre, we have met several times with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| We are committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| We actually have a traffic impact analysis that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| We don't have the results back in hand yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| It's fully in a formalized report, but we're committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| paying for the improvements to that intersection at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Goddard Lane kind of comes in there, and it's kind of at an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| odd angle, so that intersection needs to be changed regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| of whether our development moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| But we're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| At four dwelling units an acre, that will give us some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| runway and leeway to make those types of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Commissioner Daley did ask the county to do a traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| analysis of its own out there, and the average daily trips on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| this stretch of Tipton Station Road is 1,295 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Again, in talking to Engineering Public Works, they believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| this road has capacity to absorb the additional impact that four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| dwelling units an acre will be placing on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| You know, they were more concerned with the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| issues than they were with the capacity or the road width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| which at its narrowest through there is 19.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| The staff's recommendation of two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| that would be allowed if this were in the rural area under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| current growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| The current growth policy plan, section 4.3, allows considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| of two dwelling units an acre if you have roads that are at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| 20 feet wide, and it's going to PR, and you have adequate water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| and sewer, which this property meets all those criteria for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| rural area to go to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| But this, however, is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| The land use map before the sector plan was low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| residential, which allowed considerations for five units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| It's now rural conservation, which, again, allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| consideration for up to five units an acre, but requires that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| 50% of that property remain to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| So, you know, it allows us to move forward with the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| It's going to be very sensitive to the environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| that we've heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| And that's, again, we've spent all this time and effort and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| energy going through advanced NOx, and we are trying to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| something that speaks directly to the plans that we have adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| at the four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| When you look at what's there, the development has, in large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| part, been concentrated closer to the schools, and you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| And it's now starting to move out further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| You look, the closest zoning is actually an RA zoning, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| touches this property there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| You can zoom in a little bit more, and you can see the little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| That allows 4.3 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| There's five units an acre zoned about 1,700 feet to the, there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| And then there's PR closer to the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| You know, and when we're looking and trying to find places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| are appropriate, this is a relatively flat piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| It would be a good opportunity to take advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| It speaks to the plans that we have to try to deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3462)|

| 0:58:15| Actually, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| We were having some issues with the clock, and it's set for five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| minutes, so he does have an additional three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| I was trying to get him to break a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| You and I are going to have a conversation later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I had him off the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| I just wanted to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Four units an acre would allow us to come forward with a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| It would allow us to address the intersection issues that are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| there, and it would speak to the advanced NOx goals of avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| sprawl and allowing development in areas where the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| will allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Counselor, I've got a quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| You were talking really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Appreciate the brevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| You know, my last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| Should I just have a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Something I've always wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Do you all charge by the minute that you speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Don't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Now, when you were talking, you said a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| One, if approved, there were 70 acres set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| So, right now it's 85 total acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Are you wanting four units on the 85, all clustered on the 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| which would really put it at about 280 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| No, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| If we can go to the, what you see on there is only 85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| There's an additional 70 acres that's part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| You can see the yellow line's kind of hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| The property south of Stock Creek, that's 70 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| If we go to the hillside, the topography could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| That's all hillside and wooded lands across from Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| That is where it's going to be in the conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| The four units an acre is only the 85 that we've asked for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| We didn't ask for zoning anything south of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Because that math was, you're going to be putting them on top of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| That's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| You know, it's funny that we just discussed similar size on a major roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| sorry, a major arterial, and approved it at three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| which I think is quite appropriate because of the access to the existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| And, you know, it's already a trafficked area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| In this situation, I think that two units is the highest appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| because it's not on a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| It's tucked away a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| And I agree that cutting, even with that 70-acre preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| which, I mean, that piece is pretty dang steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| So I think it would, I know that there's some parts of it that are not as steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| but I think that if this were clustered more, it might make sense to go with more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| But I do worry that 85 acres covered in four dwelling units an acre would be too high on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3667)|
| 1:01:19| So I think that staff has it right on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| First, I want to speak to the fact that if we stop building houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| that doesn't mean that people are going to stop moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| What that means is that young people like me and your kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| and the young people that work in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| who are the economic drivers of this community aren't going to be able to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And what does that make Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| If we're not growing, then we become the Rust Belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| And so while I have, you know, sympathy and I don't like change either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| the fact of the matter is that we have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| We have to start building more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| And if everything is a half acre lot, who's going to be able to afford a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| I know somebody, one of the speakers threw out, you know, the number 400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| That's really cheap all over Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| That is not, like, that's, if I could find a house for $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| I'd jump through the ceiling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| That's just not realistic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| So, you know, that coupled with the fact that the developers committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| to making road improvements necessary for the increased density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| the fact that this property has been in, you know, various ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| whether that's the planned growth or the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| that allow up to four units an acre for quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| probably longer than I've even been alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I think it's appropriate here and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I would move to approve this up to four units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| because it's consistent with the growth policy plan and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| So you are putting that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| Commissioner Overton makes a motion for four per the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| I've got a comment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Sure you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| I will recognize you as the commenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Yeah, and I guess first off I wanted to comment to Mr. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| You know, I've seen a lot of that type of thing, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| but we're an appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| We're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| So we're really here to try to look at what is the right use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| trying to balance what's good for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| and what's good on what should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| So I do very much respect what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| But as an appointed body, we don't take political pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| You know, we've been put in this position to use our best judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| But, you know, with respect to this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| as I read rural conservation in the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| it says in rural areas these places are appropriate for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| development in a conservation pattern with lots that are smaller than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| typical rural lots and that are clustered to leave the natural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| And speaking to Mr. Higgins, too, I agree there's some overlap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| or, you know, some similarities to the deal that we just voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| on Chapman Highway or close to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| similarities with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| But it sounds to me, and they speak of conserving 50% or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| it looks to me they're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| They could have come through and asked for two units an acre over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| entire 155 acres in planned residential and then consolidated that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| Maybe that would have been a better request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| But the numbers work out about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Four units an acre on the 80-some-odd acres or two units an acre spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| over the whole 155.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| So that's where my second on the motion to Ms. Overton comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you, Commissioner Hueber, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| I agree with Commissioner Higgins that two is appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| as I commented on the last case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I mean, that was on Chapman Highway, and we approved three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| and now we're looking at a motion to approve four, not on a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| So I don't see the logic in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| You know, it allows us to do consideration up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| and that's where this body has to use their best judgment to see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| infrastructure is like, what the development patterns around it are like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| And I think four is way too high when you zoom out and look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| different factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I mean, I think going at maybe half of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| maybe around two and a half could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| But additionally, I get tired of hearing applicants come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| and sort of mention we'll do this only if we can achieve X density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| some sort of veiled threat that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| improvements to our community aren't possible unless developers are able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| really cram things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| I mean, we have other methods of improving our community with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| and it doesn't require developers to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| These are public roads that the public can pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| So this isn't the only method that we can improve things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| So I don't like those kinds of sort of propositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| So I'd be in favor of less than four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Commissioner Mias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Schill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| So, you know, it's funny because I feel like if this project at two dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| units per acre isn't economically feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| then the time's maybe not right for development at this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| You know, our job here is not to listen to counselors on what they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| afford and can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| I applaud them wanting to conserve the back side of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and I agree with Commissioner Overton about housing and the lack of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| But, you know, our decision is based on land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| and I look at this piece of property, and I know that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| I know there's no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I ride my bike on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| It's narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| It's not close to a school like these other properties that have a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| density are in that area, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I'm not going to be able to support four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| and I think staff has it right at two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| I would say that, you know, the Chapman Highway zoning, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| was a little different because of all the acreage that was in the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| I mean, on Chapman Highway, it being a state route, a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| you could have seen densities higher than 12 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| We did that limited because of the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| I'm not sure, you know, we approve zonings on, what is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| a major collector up to five all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| So that's just my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Mr. Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I'm trying to get us out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| No, the only thing, and I want to say this for the education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| for my fellow commissioners, but also for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| You know, we're tasked, all of us are volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| We're appointed and we serve, and it takes a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| I mean, every single person is giving up half of their work day to serve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| So, you know, don't take it as, you know, ignoring what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| But we are constrained by the fact that there are a lot of people moving into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| We can increase density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| We cannot create more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| We only have X amount of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| And what we tried to do through the comprehensive growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| and the transportation plan is to ensure that we kept some of the rural areas rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| limited growth, try and limit sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| This is an area over probably 30 years that has allowed for up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| We can keep it from taking another 50 acres somewhere else to add the same number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| that they're trying to get here while preserving the 70 acres on the backside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| When I read that, I just saw the 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| So it's been a long couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| So don't take it as this body is not reactive to the concerns of people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| We're trying to balance really a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| And I just had a daughter who graduated high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| The thought of her having to graduate college now and the cheapest house she can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| anywhere in Knoxville is around $285 for about 1,000 square feet is just heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| I mean, over on Chickamauga, houses that just a decade ago might have sold for about $120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| are now selling for $285.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| We're on a trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| If we don't get more housing that's affordable for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| we're pricing them out of being able to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| The American Dream was founded on home ownership, home property ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| If we just make them permanent renters, then very few people will actually ever own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| and we will have people subject to homeowners, to property owners, property managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| not having the American Dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| So we're trying to balance that to be able to make sure that people can afford to live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| that we want to keep Knoxville the best place to work, to live, to raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| South Knoxville, people love moving there because it's a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| They love moving into halls and PAL, Feria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| People move where they feel comfortable and where they want to raise their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| and I don't think that we should just be denying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| because we want to keep things the way they always have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Change is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| You're either growing or you're dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| There is no maintaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| and we've got to continue growing in a smart and responsible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| without just completely losing everything about the character of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| So that's what everyone up here is trying to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| and really just weigh as we're thinking through all of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| So I just want everybody to understand what's going through my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| and I know my fellow commissioners, it's what's going through theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| So just understand that we're not responsible or reactive just to your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| We're trying to weigh a whole lot of factors in the decisions we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| So we do have a motion to approve the PR plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| with up to four dwelling units per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| because it's consistent with the county comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| as made motion by Commissioner Overton and seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Mr. Chair, I've got another comment if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| If you do mind, I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I think that we should all keep in mind that even though there is a need for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| to Commissioner Smith's point, we need to be very considerate of the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| and think about smart growth and where it makes sense to put housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| If you need protein, you could eat probably 100 Reese's cups and get the protein you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| but that's not going to be the best way to get that protein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| It's going to have a lot of other side effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| And I think that if we approve higher density in places that don't make sense for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4394)|
| 1:13:25| from a planning standpoint, our kids will run into the same problems that we run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| with traffic and other issues from improper planning 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4412)|
| 1:13:42| So I do think that, yeah, I don't think anyone here disagrees that there's a need for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| and Knoxville is going to keep growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| I think the important thing is to think about where it makes sense to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| and to keep the character of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| and not lose that to leveling trees and hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| and putting sprawling streets and individual houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| So I don't disagree with fellow commissioners for the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| but I don't think it's appropriate in rural areas like this to go with the higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| With that, no more comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| No more comments, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4476)|

| 1:15:12| Okay, motion has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you for everybody's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Item number 15 is the next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| File number 6A24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Applicant is Elizabeth Davis Rains, west side of Gibbs Road, northeast of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| Approximate size of the tract is 0.72 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| The present zone is A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| The zoning request is RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| The existing land use is single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| We would have one motion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| The staff recommendation is to approve the RA low density residential zone for the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| of the parcel requested in Exhibit B because it's consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| Plan and other development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| I have signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Come to the podium, please, if you would, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I have Aaron Taylor and Tammy Conant sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| And your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Aaron Taylor, 7634 Gibbs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Yeah, so just real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| The character of that neighborhood, it's all large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| One acre up to 12 acres, one house on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| There's several little places that families have chosen to put more houses, but it's families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| What we're talking about here, it's not a road leading to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| It's a skinny gravel driveway in the back of a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| So I have to consider the worst thing possible that could happen if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Like, what is going to go out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| The next consideration, I know you say the street is wide enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| That's only true for the first tenth from Tazewell Pike and probably the first tenth from the Emory Roadside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| Two cars can't fit without one car getting in people's yards or the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| The county did come and approve the bad curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| It's wide enough now, but most of that road is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| You have the three Gibbs schools and 730 to 830 and 230 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| That's the Gibbs Raceway, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| It's dangerous, and people are using that as a cut through and protecting my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4680)|
| 1:18:10| I built out there eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| I could have built anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| I'm a schoolteacher for 32 years, so I work hard for my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| I just want to protect my investment and living in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| Not that it couldn't be with the right decision, but that's a field out in the middle of a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| What's going to go back in the middle of that field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| I know what's out there now is what I call a tiny house and another house that has been shipped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| What's the plan for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| I don't want that on my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Is Ms. Conant in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| My name is Tammy Conant, 7619 Gibbs Road, Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| My husband and I have lived at 7619 Gibbs Road since 1991, and I would like to thank you all for hearing our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| I, along with 35 residents, taxpayers on the road, have signed a petition to strongly oppose the request for rezoning of the property at 7639.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4747)|
| 1:19:17| We have a great concern that this totality is really out of character for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| Our concerns are decreased property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| The rezoning could negatively impact property values in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| Homeowners have invested in this area to live quiet, rural neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| and to allow duplexes, single home, garage apartments, detached homes for this requested area is inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4776)|
| 1:19:45| The requested change could negatively impact our small community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Our other concern is increased traffic in already dangerous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| This would lead to an increase in the traffic flow in the already dangerous and narrow road, posing safety issues to children and to residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| And due to the community complaints of the road being so dangerously narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Jim Snowden, who was the chief Knox County engineer, came out and measured the road, advising it was only 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| Please note, two vehicles cannot pass on this road without having to leave the road and navigate the ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| The pavement on Gibbs Road is crumbling, it's narrow, and needs attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| When school is in session, Gibbs Road becomes a dangerous shortcut and racetrack for students and parents rushing to get to Gibbs High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| Gibbs Elementary, and Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Students and parents use this route to avoid the traffic backup on Tassel Pot to access and leave the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| This occurs between the hours of 7 to 8.30 in the morning and 3.15 to 4 in the afternoon, Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| Traffic is very heavy during these times and very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| The next one would be the privacy. We moved to Gibbs for privacy and lack of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| The proposed change would have detrimental impact to surrounding residents with the increased traffic flow and dangerously narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| Thank you for your time, for our concerns, and urge you to disapprove this proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| And I do have the name, the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Yes, if you could just bring it up to staff and we'll get that into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you very much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I'm going to ask one more time if the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Elizabeth Davis Raines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I've got a question for staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Can you all explain what the difference, if this is approved, what can be done versus what could currently be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| Yes, so the RA zone is what they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| That allows single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| It allows duplexes as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| This property is, I'll get back onto the tools and click on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| They're basically wanting to subdivide this part off of this piece and build an additional home is what the applicant wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| But as you know, anything that's allowed in our way would be able to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| So if this, once they've subdivided this, there could be one house in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| or a house, maybe a duplex in the front, in the portion in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| and then really limited to just a house in the back portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| So it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| The area that they're wanting to carve off looks like it's 2.1 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| which could hold up to four single family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| Again, that's not her intent, but that's the max that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| The staff report says it's .72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| I have the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Yeah, I have 60 pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4984)|
| 1:23:17| The reason I ask, I think that the concerns with what could be done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=4997)|
| 1:23:27| I don't think it's quite as severe as what it may seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| I think this is, at most, let's see, if it's .72, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5013)|
| 1:23:43| Most of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Yeah, so at most maybe three dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| I would doubt it would be ‑‑ looks like it would be pretty hard to lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| that many out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| So I think more likely it's going to be something like a one or two family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| and then there might be another residence in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| But I think that the impact will be pretty minimal to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| So with that, I'd go ahead and make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Commissioner Schelzo with second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Seeing no other comments, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| The next item we have on the agenda is file number 6D24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| The applicant is Knoxville Real Estate Management, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| The location is southeast side of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| northeast of Elm Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| The approximate size of the tract is 2.09 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| The present zoning is PR planned residential up to one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| The zoning requested is PR planned residential up to two for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| The staff recommendation is approve the PR planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| with up to two dwelling units for the acre because it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| This will take just that one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| Javonte Cotner, 1120 Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| Does anybody want to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Are you the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| You're more than welcome to speak or I can ask if there's any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| and you can wait for them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I want to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| I have a couple signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Greg Wonderman and Glenn Chenu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5163)|
| 1:26:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Greg Wonderman, 2239 Barrywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| I want to begin by saying thank you for your time today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| and appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| We are certainly recommending that it remain unchanged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| at less than one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| to be consistent with the neighborhood around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| All of the adjoining properties are one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| and have been so for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| When this property was purchased in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| this was one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| and all of the homes surrounding this lot already existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| when the current property owner purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| The reasonable expectation would be that it would remain as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Furthermore, this narrow landlocked parcel has only a single entry point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| and if you can pull up the topography while we're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| I certainly think it would impress upon you that this is only a two-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and out of the two acres, you can see that there's almost no usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| There's one acre or less of usable space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| When you look at the massive drainage swale that's up front and the culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and you look at the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| and the cost, as an engineer has commented earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| of going up that hillside and the problems of that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| you would look at not approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I want to make that clear to the council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| You are not approving four units on two acres, but rather four per half acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| and I feel comfortable saying that you would not approve today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| eight units per acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| That would be beyond feasibility for any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| Now, I also would say that this is a unique property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Obviously, it's a wooded property in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| There's not much of that left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| but I might mention that just down the road, 115 townhomes are in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| less than about a half a mile there by the food city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| as well as the hillside that's being cleared right behind Matlock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| along with multiple other possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| I think you have one on the docket today for eight units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| behind Hardin Valley as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| So I want to point out that this is a unique property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| It has a very small developable area on it, and it is in complete contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| When I look at the staff comments here in terms of point number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| it says the intent of which is to ensure the context of new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| including scale and compatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| does not impact existing neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| This would be a significant impact to the adjoining neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| all single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| And point number five, that it is to conserve and connect natural features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| and habitat of which this would be a complete destruction to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| All of the drainage from the entire neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| and from the single-family housing all go through that culvert there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| which would cause a significant issue to future development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| We recognize, of course, the right to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| and we recognize the right and the importance of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| but we respectfully request that the zoning remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Is someone else here to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Come to the podium and give your name, address, and phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Clint Schoening, 2211 Barrywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| I live at the top of the hill there, right behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| I have full knowledge of every time it rains, stuff floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| So even from the recommendations from the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| the upper half is recommended at no more than one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| The bottom, as Greg pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| is the drainage basin for the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| I don't think the staff took that into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| but looking at the topography, you're like, well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| maybe they should have taken in the drainage basin there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| as non-buildable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| So what I believe Greg was trying to say is it's going to be a small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| unequal distribution on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| It's not going to be like the houses on Barrywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| It's not going to be like the property on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| and it's not going to be like the property to the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| To the north side, that lake there is actually your drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| That's where everything ends up before it ends up in Connors Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| which swells every time it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| There is also a concern that as you leave Barrywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| there's very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| It's landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| There's 131 feet access there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| and you can't see it from where Barrywood intersects Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5484)|
| 1:31:33| So I would like those issues addressed before any change in zoning occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Is there anybody else in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| The applicant, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| I spoke with my civil engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| and I see a lot of the comments is about the stormwater drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| and he said we would address that in planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| and we won't create no more stormwater drain this hour either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| That's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| We're talking about the difference of two dwelling units here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| Stormwater problems in this area are not, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| the burden of a small parcel like this or the fault of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| They're the fault of the thousands of other parcels around there that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| you know, been turned to hardscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| and even though those do have stormwater management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| I think that that is ideally sufficient to the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| but I don't think that we can put the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| any stormwater issues onto this parcel as their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| So with that, I will ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| I think it would be maybe appropriate here to add a similar condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| we had on an earlier case with regards to the disturbance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| and following the recommendation of the slope analysis disturbance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| is that something that we can add on to rezoning requests like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| With that, I'll make a motion to approve per staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| with the addition of a condition that the disturbed area within the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| protection area be limited to the report in the recommendation in staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5628)|
| 1:34:02| Is that sufficient, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5642)|
| 1:34:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins and a second by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| and we're just trying to make sure that the additional language on the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| Commissioner Higgins, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| You want it to be limited to the first chart that's included in the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| that says recommended disturbance budget within the HP acres is .4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| That's 36% of the HP area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Is everybody clear as to what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Did you have a comment, Commissioner Shelton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5703)|
| 1:35:13| Next item on the agenda is item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| Commissioners, we did receive a request, a last-minute request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| from the applicants requesting postponement of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| For how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| Let me see if there's any opposition first since this is on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| We're recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| The next agenda item is item number 6I-24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| The applicant is Julie Cloninger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Location, north side of Thorn Grove Pike, west of Kennedy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| Approximate size of the track is 2.12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| The present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| The zoning request is a CN neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| The current staff recommendation is to deny the CN neighborhood commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| because it does not meet all the conditions of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| And as Director Brooks noted, the applicant has requested postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| but we will ask if there's any opposition present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| Is it a 30-day postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Is it 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| That's what I recommend, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Motion to postpone for 30 days would be the appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Motion to postpone for 30 days won't be my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Motion and a second to postpone for 30 days by Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Was that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| Postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5822)|
| 1:37:11| Next item on the agenda is agenda item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| The file number is 6L24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| The applicant is Taylor D. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| The location is southeast side of Sandley Road, east of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Approximate size of the track is 49.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| The present zone is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| The zoning request is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| The existing land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| The density proposed is up to eight dwelling units per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| The staff recommendation is to approve the PR planned residential zone with up to eight dwelling units per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| because it's consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan and is supported by residential amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| I have, number one is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I have down as opposition a Jeff McCormick, a William Nichols, and a Rob Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5887)|
| 1:38:19| Applicant, you can go first or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| Here on behalf of the property owner, as noted, we've requested a rezoning of this property to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| up to a density of eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| This property is located near the intersection of Samley Road and Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| Under the growth policy plan, it's designated as being located within the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| I believe prior to the plan amendment updates, it was already in the planned growth area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| The property has a land use designation now under the new Comprehensive Land Use Plan of traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5939)|
| 1:39:06| As I addressed that earlier, that provides for a mix of housing types, single family, townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| and some small scale or intended to be small scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| The significance of the traditional neighborhood land use designation is that it contemplates the neighborhood having amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5958)|
| 1:39:28| in the area as parks and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| The significance of this is that this property is located, shares a boundary line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| It's adjacent to several schools, the Hardin Valley Elementary School, Hardin Valley Academy School, and Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| The property is also located within a quarter mile approximately to a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| This property, the prior sector plan designation prior to the updated or the new Comprehensive Land Use Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5991)|
| 1:39:59| had an MDR, the Medium Density Residential, and as you're familiar from that prior sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| that would allow under the PR zone, rezoning a density of up to between 6 and 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| The property is within the boundaries of the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| There are public right-of-way improvements designed, and those may possibly already be scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| Director Snowden can, I guess, identify that timeline better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| But that's at the intersection of the, as I mentioned, the Sam Lee Road and Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| That intersection is being improved with a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| Like I said, I think that is already scheduled for a start date at some point to be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| So we'll have the improvements there at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| I think they do maybe expand off of that to some degree as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| Also in the works on Sam Lee Road, as you can tell on the screen, the sharp 90-degree curve angle there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6055)|
| 1:41:04| Knox County Engineering is in the process of having that road and that section realigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| That realignment to remove that sharp 90-degree angle curve will create kind of a more gentle slope or curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| and will impact this property at the northern corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| I think kind of the sketch initial preliminary realignment probably would impact by about approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6083)|
| 1:41:32| plus or minus five acres of this property with Sam Lee being realigned and cutting into that northern corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6092)|
| 1:41:42| We're working with Director Snowden, the engineering department, on that realignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| and working through that process on assisting how we can with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6109)|
| 1:41:57| This property, although there is substantial acreage to it, there are some site constraints potentially on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6117)|
| 1:42:08| There's recognizable closed contours potentially on some of this property in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| We'll have to do further investigation to discover the extent of those closed contours and how they'll impact it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6135)|
| 1:42:23| As you're aware from considering other matters, closed contours aren't necessarily uncommon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| but they do at times impact the overall resulting density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| We submit the requested rezoning provides a great opportunity to develop housing at an appropriate density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| where there are existing public amenities and supporting infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| We ask that you approve the staff recommendation to rezone the property to plan residential at a density of up to eight dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6167)|
| 1:42:55| because it's consistent with the comprehensive land use plan and supported by the residential amenities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| I'd remind the opposition to try to do the best you can to split up the five minutes between yourselves if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| Jeff McCormick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| William Nichols, 11400 Valley View Landing Lane, which is adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6194)|
| 1:43:23| This zoning request is not compatible with the existing 14 subdivisions within a two-mile radius of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6203)|
| 1:43:32| which lays north of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| All 14 subdivisions are zoned single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| Usually four single family houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| All single family homes are adjacent to the west of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| The north edge of the property are single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| and there's been created a new single family home on the east side of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| To the south is located Hardin Valley School, so there's no exit east or west, only north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6241)|
| 1:44:10| I have pictures if you'd like to look at them as the road there on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| Consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Your growth plan has been very consistent over the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| You said that this area is all zoned single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| You just got through approving two new subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| one on Couch Mill and one on Sam Lee Road as single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6278)|
| 1:44:47| I am asking now, why are you going to deviate from 30 years of zoning single family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6287)|
| 1:44:57| Why are you deviating from what you've done in the past and you did today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| Density, they're saying eight units per acre is roughly 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| Usually there could be taking in consideration parking and roads into that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6310)|
| 1:45:19| there could be 30 housing units, single family units, with 2.3 families per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6319)|
| 1:45:29| Or it could be 600 units if we use apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| So now we've got roughly 600 family units living on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6335)|
| 1:45:45| Or it could be 1,300 family units living on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| The other problem is there's only one entrance and one exit onto this property, onto Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| If you've been out there, you realize how narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| It's not 24 feet wide all along Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| Some of it is less than 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| There's no shoulders, there's just ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| You take in consideration the families, say 600 families living there, they have two cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6377)|
| 1:46:26| So you dump, say, 600 family units to the two cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| that's 600 cars that will be making trips during the day from that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| So you take four trips, which is normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| that's 2,400 trips off of this property into Sam Lee onto Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6403)|
| 1:46:54| Also, the issue we have now, there is farm equipment travels up and down Couchville, Steel Road, Swofford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6414)|
| 1:47:06| Mr. Nichols, we have some other folks that want to sign up to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Can you mind wrapping that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| This past year on Sam Lee, there's a school bus wreck, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| That's how narrow this facility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| Part of this property to the south is in the school area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6446)|
| 1:47:34| You're going to have to have some kind of retention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| That would be on the southeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| The schools are using this floodplain area for ecological studies at Hardin Valley schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6462)|
| 1:47:53| So you're going to contaminate that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| I'm not opposed to single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| Let me get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| But I am opposed to multi-unit, because we could have between 300 and 600 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Would you like to see these pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| You can bring them to the staff, and we'll pass those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Rob Sanders, 2654 Barringer Station Lane, here on behalf of Lancaster Ridge Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| I'm going to be extremely brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| I agree with most of what he said, other than I trust that the infrastructure issues on Sam Lee Road will be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6516)|
| 1:48:45| I know Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| I know his engineering team, so I'm not too worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| What I am worried about is one of his points, and that is eight development units per acre does not match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| If you'll turn that zoning layer back on and zoom out, you've got up to three, up to four, nothing in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6536)|
| 1:49:05| nothing in there anywhere around us is as dense as what is that being asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6545)|
| 1:49:14| And, I mean, a subdivision there is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| Why can't you make it the same density as everything else around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| I have Jeff McCormick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| Are you Mr. McCormick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| I'm Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| 1418 Mill Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Let's try to do a couple minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Two minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| I'll keep it high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| I think they've covered everything I had in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| So, first of all, I appreciate the commission for giving us the best county and the best state and the best country on the planet Earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6585)|
| 1:49:53| So, thank you for your contributions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| In terms of my opposition to this particular development, we have, it's a health and safety concern as well as a financial concern long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6596)|
| 1:50:05| Our infrastructure currently could not possibly support high density development in that particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| especially in light of all the recent approvals and building of other high density around the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| The tributaries, the road tributaries and the general area just cannot support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| From a health and safety standpoint, the number of accidents, it's not safe to even bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| The community has kind of lost its culture and its nature and a lot of the reason why Hardin Valley people became Hardin Valley people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| I fully understand the economic factors that you guys have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| It pains me some of what you're dealing with when it comes to affordability in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| It's a double edged sword, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| We've got the greatest county, like I said, on the planet Earth, but it's gotten prohibitively expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| With high density developments going into areas like Hardin Valley at a disproportionate rate to the rest of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| as we know, Hardin Valley has grown faster than any of the rest of Knox County over the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| There's an economic factor known as negative externality where we're siphoning value from the surrounding properties away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| to compensate for the decreased value of the high density properties around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| That's one factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Essentially, that means that the current homeowners are bearing the financial burden for this rapid growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| So until we can get the infrastructure to support this level of density and without some balance on those economic factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6699)|
| 1:51:48| I don't think high density should be approved at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| In addition to that, a lot of Hardin Valley people that I talk to and meet with would like to see dining and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| and additional growth, which is what's helped make Knox County incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| I need you to wrap it up here, Mr. McCormick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| It's hard to cost justify putting in finer dining and restaurants and things like that based on a demographic profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6726)|
| 1:52:14| that may not be able to support that as we continue to proliferate high density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| The applicant would have a couple minutes if you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Shocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| I just have a couple comments based off of what we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| I think that the point that was made about dining and other resources in the area, those things are supported by more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6765)|
| 1:52:58| I think that if you want a more developed and mixed use area, I think that more people are appropriate for building that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6778)|
| 1:53:12| In this case, I think someone made the point that it is inevitable that this will be a subdivision at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6792)|
| 1:53:20| I guess my request, my hope for the applicant is that when you all do go into planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| that you'll look into trying to minimize the disturbed area of the site and preserve as much farmland as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| former farmland, and try to consolidate and conserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| I also think that when we see the development plan, I really hope that you all can work with the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6822)|
| 1:53:51| and look into a pedestrian pathway that connects to the school property and allows for kids to be able to walk to school right there safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6831)|
| 1:54:01| instead of having to, gosh, it would be so frustrating to have to drive from where that pointer is just around the block to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6841)|
| 1:54:11| From what I've heard, I would assume it wouldn't be very safe to walk that on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| I think it would be very crucial if you are bringing in a lot of dwelling units to have that connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6856)|
| 1:54:31| I think that this is a great spot to put multifamily housing right by the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| It reminds me a lot, I'm a Farragut girl, so it reminds me a lot of the condos and apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| not the new ones that everyone's mad about, the ones that have been there forever off of Grigsby Chapel and Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| that are right near the school and it provides opportunities for people that are in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| A lot of my friends built houses, or their parents did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| They build houses so they need a spot to land, or retirees that want to stay in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| There's similar types of places near Bearden High School and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| I bring that up to say that I would say everybody in this room can agree that the property values in Bearden, Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| and the rest of West Knoxville are doing just fine in spite of being in close proximity to multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| If you want to look at another example, you can look in Williamson County in the Brentwood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| I think that that would probably be the most expensive county in our entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| There's plenty of mixed-use condos and multifamily housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| To the property owners, I don't think that your houses are going to plummet in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| In fact, I think they'll continue to appreciate quite a bit as they have in the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| So I'm in support of this fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| This question is for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Can you update us on the Hardin Valley mobility plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| I know there is a lot of work that has gone into looking at and evaluating the roads and the traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| Sure, I'd be glad to, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| We do have, one gentleman mentioned here earlier, we do plan on constructing a roundabout there at Steel Road and Sam Lee and Swofford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6962)|
| 1:56:12| I always get that's kind of an odd intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Ever Road is a different name, so hopefully I got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| Right there, we do have a roundabout planned at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| Hopefully start sometime construction of that sometime in calendar year 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| In addition to that, we also have a project that was approved in the fiscal year budget 25 that just got approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| that will improve capacity along Hardin Valley Road east of award-winning way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| As you're driving, Hardin Valley Road is primarily a three-lane facility now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| But it's 40 feet wide with 12-foot lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| So as you're kind of leaving the school and going to the east towards Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| obviously you have a lot more commercialization, and that's where most of the delay occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| So we do have a project that will take that three-lane to five-lane from award-winning way all the way to Solway Road, Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7020)|
| 1:57:11| As part of a phase one, that's something that we'll probably start construction on next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| It doesn't require a lot of work because a lot of it is just kind of repurposing the existing asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| and kind of narrowing some of the lane widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| So that project will probably be implemented in the next 18 months to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7045)|
| 1:57:33| And then we also are going to do a RFQ for consultants to start the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| of really creating Hardin Valley from the west of there, including the area near the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| as well as all the way to Hickory Creek and beyond to create really a multi-lane facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| to maybe make it look like something like Chaud Road would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| because as part of the lane use plan that got adopted, we anticipate a lot of growth in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| We want to be as proactive as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| We want that road with all those farms that are still existing out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| to really be able to have a way for those folks to get out at Everett Road and Watt Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| as the state improves the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| So probably over the next five to ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| there will be tens of millions of dollars of county money invested in that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| to make traffic much, much better than it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Yeah, I guess probably one of the more important things I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| is that there's going to be what I would call a quick improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| not the ten-year type, five-year, but 18 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| And that would probably align a little bit more with by the time this property actually gets developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| there's a concept plan, and anybody actually living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| there's going to be significant improvements to the roads right in that immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| You know, Mr. McCormick and Mr. Sanders both, I'd like to echo Ms. Overton's comment about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7133)|
| 1:59:01| Everybody has an opinion about property values, and it's easy to get scared about multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7141)|
| 1:59:08| And we don't know that that's what the applicant wants to do yet anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| But I can tell you from experience, from developing a Class A apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| in West Knoxville off of Westland Drive probably ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| that was one of the biggest things that the neighbors were worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| They were concerned there was a multifamily building going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| and it was going to decimate everybody's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| And I'm saying they were probably six, $700,000 homes then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Well, since then, I can tell you of five million and a half to $2 million homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| that have been built adjacent to that same apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| So my point being, somebody's not going to go out and build a million and a half, $2 million house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| unless they're comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| And I think they would be very comfortable in Arden Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| It's certainly been the gem of where everybody wants to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| I don't see that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| To Mr. Nichols, and again probably to Mr. Sanders as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| the thought of why deviate from where we are on the zoning of everything around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| I think Commissioner Smith had a very impassioned comment earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| it's our job to look at everything, and we have to consider everybody moving in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| We just got done with Advanced Knox and redoing the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| and the comprehensive plan, and in that, through a lot of negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| a lot of thought, a lot of everybody looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| this area is considered one of the better areas to have a higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| because of its location next to the school, because it's walkable to the grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| There are some more restaurants that are coming in that area, all very walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| But why deviate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| The main thing is we've got to stop the sprawl of going too far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| We've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| I saw it back in 2005, 2006, where we would go way, way, way out in the middle of nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| and I know we just did one on Tipton Station that some might be thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| but I think it's in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| It's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| That area is still planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| This is definitely planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| But we have to increase the density where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| to try to help the health of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| and the health of the market and just the living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| So I think it's a very appropriate location for eight units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Thank you, Commissioner Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| So the proximity to school, the school is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| I think that we're being a little over-optimistic with the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| I mean, unless the subdivision can connect to the sidewalk right there at the school access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| there is no immediate sidewalk access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| And it's unfortunate because, I mean, really, the subdivision next to it, Lancaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| and then the, like, four or five subdivisions all over to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| I mean, it's a hellscape of lack of connectivity between subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| You can't get from many of them to the neighboring subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| without going all the way down to Hardin Valley Road or back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| So I think we're a little optimistic with the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| I hope that that can be fixed with some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| But I think in the immediate, school access roads would be pretty imperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| at least for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| But the short-sightedness of us not requiring concept plans to have stub-outs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| to some of these neighboring parcels that if we would have had a stub-out in Lancaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| there's sidewalks in there, this would have immediate sidewalk access right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| And so, you know, as one of the neighbors brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| the negative externalities of that is that people can't walk as easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| I mean, building cheaper subdivisions without sidewalks has negative externalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| such as higher obesity rates and lack of fitness for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| And so it's important that we keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| And this is my last meeting, so I'm going to say some things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| But you guys need to remember that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| I think, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| the improvements that the county is talking about would include sidewalks, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Smith, I think, was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Well, I was just listening through all this. I don't really have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| I was just going to make a motion to approve the PR zone with up to eight dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| because it's consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| and supported by residential amenities per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| So we have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| a second by Commissioner Huber to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| And I had Browning. Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| No, I was just going to make that same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| Those opposed. Ayes have it. Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| The next item on the agenda is item number 25, 6N24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7472)|
| 2:04:52| The applicant is Justin Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| The location is the north side of Ball Camp Pike, northeast of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| Approximate size of the track is four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7500)|

| 2:05:14| The staff recommendation is to approve the PR planned residential zone up to 12 per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7514)|

| 2:05:26| because it is consistent with the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| and changing conditions along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| Justin Harvey, Anthem View Lane, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| I'd like to defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Mr. Chairman, there are two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Can we just ask them to stay to two and a half minutes each so that we don't run up against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7549)|
| 2:05:59| I'll let the other go first if she'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| I think she has more important things to say than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| So who else would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7571)|
| 2:06:21| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| My name is Karen Bishop, 8747 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| I'm two houses down from where they want to put this into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| and I just want to say five years ago I wanted to replace something on my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| and it was a trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| I have two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| I had to consult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| Well, I have one acre and another acre that I hadn't consolidated together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| To be able to do, to replace that trailer, I had to consolidate the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7602)|
| 2:06:49| do another survey on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| It took me five and a half months for it to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and all I was doing was replacing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| They told me that I could never, ever put anything else on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| Now we're talking about putting up to five duplexes or five homes on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7625)|
| 2:07:13| and you want to raise it to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| Five, if you wanted to do, that's 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| That's just incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| It's not big enough for five houses or, you know, 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| And then you want to go to 12, 48 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| I understand that we improved the road and it's going to be going, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| both directions and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| I can't get out of my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| How in the world, if we're going to have anywhere from 20 to 48 homes right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| in a consolidated area where we have been there over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| have, you know, have not been able to get out of our driveway because of the school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| The school's overcrowded as it is, and you want to put more people into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| There's not enough places for them to build onto that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| Then you've got Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| You've got Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| They're both overcrowded already, and you're wanting to put more places in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| Where are these kids going to go to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| Where are we going to bus them to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| We did another school at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| It's almost full too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| What are we going to do with educating our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| Where are we going to bus them to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| Put them on a school bus for a half hour to get to another school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Are you going to build more schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I just don't understand how you could put that many places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| You don't even have two accesses out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| If it went up to Daybreak, Daybreak's a one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| You have to pull off to the side for somebody else to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| You're going to put people onto Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| Well, it's going to be Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| It's going from 75 all the way to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| Can you imagine the traffic that is going to be on that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| And you're wanting to put all those people in one consolidated place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| We're a quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| It's beautiful there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| I have been there forever, and my father-in-law before that had been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| Why do we need that many homes in a consolidated place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| We've already built up around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| I'm sorry, you know, but I just think it's wrong to put that many places in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| where there's not enough for us to be able to support it as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| I'm Becca White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| I live at 9519 Daybreak Drive on that one-and-a-half-lane road that she mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| I submitted a letter about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| I don't know if you all have read it or not, but I since then have run around the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7811)|
| 2:10:18| and gathered about 24 more signatures on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| Should I bring those up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7821)|
| 2:10:30| I've got similar sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| I'm not from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| I married into a wonderful family that has been in that area for five generations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| so I'm sort of speaking on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| I'm a middle school language arts teacher, and so I was asked to write letters and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| because that is what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| These are good, hardworking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| They are not the type who write letters and come to official meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| All of the area residents I spoke to would very much like to continue living the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| lifestyle they've always known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| Many of them, like my husband's family, have been on the land or nearby land for four or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| five generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| Many have had painful experiences trying to obtain basic amenities on that land because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| it was often deemed too rural or too difficult to reach for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Because of those experiences, they are distrustful of, as someone else said, downtown government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| They do feel that it is ironic for a government that has ignored an area for being too rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| to suddenly turn around and say a neighboring property is not rural enough for them to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| this rezoning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| Many were also not surprised to learn that the real estate listing for the property states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| that the rezoning has already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| More evidence in their minds that their concerns are not of note to the local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| I would not be here, however, if I did not believe the best of the commission members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| and my experiences with Commissioner Hill and with Director Snowden have always been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| positive, so I'm hopeful that you will hear our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| If I may add one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| We know that Knoxville is experiencing a housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| I wouldn't own my home if my husband's papa hadn't sold it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| I would assert, though, that we are experiencing more of a shortage of affordable housing rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| than just housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| Unless the 12 units per acre, which I assume would be apartments, are going to take Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| 8 vouchers, they're not going to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| Five units per acre would actually be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| They would be more likely to fill the need for reasonably priced starter homes and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| be consistent with the land use and the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| Mr. Harvey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| You have about five and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| I appreciate the community and everything they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| This property is located in what I still call Ball Camp Pike, and I think you all are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| of the improvements that that road has taken on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| It's got sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| It's going to four or five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| And I guess my question, if not there, I mean, we're not – some of these – I've listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| all day and heard lots of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| Some of these properties are located way far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| This is directly on Ball Camp Pike, which is very near the intersection of Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| which is just minutes from Pellissippi State Parkway – or Pellissippi – the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=7996)|
| 2:13:23| So I don't think an extra 40 cars or 50 cars is going to have really any impact on the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8003)|
| 2:13:30| that Knox County has made to Ball Camp, which is going to, I guess, be Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| So I don't see any issues with the traffic, and we are going to do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| It actually is a beautiful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| There's some beautiful trees that have been – look like they've been there 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| We're going to do everything we can to preserve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| And we're going to – our plan is to do attached housing so that our footprint is not taking up the whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| We hope to leave some green space – a lot of green space, actually, on four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| And I just think there's plenty – plenty – one of the ladies here and then there's another gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8040)|
| 2:14:08| that mentioned the shortage of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| It is a real, real factor, and as the next generation comes, it's only going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| And so we've got to do everything we can to help mitigate the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| And at the same time, another gentleman mentioned we've got to do it responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| I believe this is a very responsible piece of property to put 12 units per acre on because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| it's located right on Ball Camp where all of the road improvements have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| If this was another road or a two-lane road or something, we would never have asked for that amount of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| And frankly, I feel like we could have even asked for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| But I wanted to be responsible and just ask for 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| If you have any questions, otherwise, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8093)|
| 2:15:00| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| I'll jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Commissioner Heber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| Yeah, I think we're seeing a lot of transition from where we were dealing with sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8108)|
| 2:15:14| and things like that to the new comprehensive plan, which is changing some of the areas to rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8114)|
| 2:15:26| changing other ones to planned growth, changing some to urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| In this area, it changes it to the suburban mixed use, which, again, encourages the higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8129)|
| 2:15:39| I mean, as long as it's respectful, built more similar to a single-family home, I think it's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8139)|
| 2:15:47| It is on the new Shod Road connector, which is just an incredible road once it finally gets completely finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8147)|
| 2:15:54| But it's only, I don't know how many feet away from the intersection of Middlebrook Pike, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| so another major thoroughfare down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| I don't know if anybody else has any other comments or would wish to keep rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Well, with that, I'm just going to go ahead and make a motion to approve the PR planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| up to 12 units per acre for the lot area within the suburban mixed use residential place type only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| because it is consistent with the comprehensive plan and changing conditions along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| Commissioner Heber makes a motion that we approve her staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| Next one on the agenda is item number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| We pulled that off of consent, I think, before you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| File number 6S24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| The applicant's Masonic Investments LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| The location is south side of Asheville Highway east of Cash Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| Approximate size of the track is 49.18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| The present zoning is CA, general business, and A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| The zoning requested is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| The existing land use is agricultural, forestry, vacant land, and rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| The density proposed is up to five per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| The staff recommendation is to approve the PR planned residential zone with up to the five per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| because it is consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| Okay, we have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Applicant first or second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| You may come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| I have, is it Mia Bell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Ms. Bell, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| My name is Mia Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| I'm at 8021 Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| I am the fourth generation to live at my property on Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| My concern is not only outgrowing our new school, but the traffic on Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| I've had so many wrecks in my yard, taking my mailbox down, that I've lost count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| My previous neighbor has had a car go through his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| The new neighbor in that house has had a car in her front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| I personally think five houses per acre is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| I am all for growth, especially in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| We actually have a very nice habitat community right off of Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8324)|
| 2:18:53| So I, again, am very concerned with the traffic there, with the speed of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| It's not only cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| It's 18 wheelers going down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| That's my biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| I don't know enough, because I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| This is all new to me, how to research all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| But I'm curious about the entrances and the exits to this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| and what they're going to do about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| Before you get away, this is just a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| So we don't have a subdivision plan yet presented before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| and that would come at a later time through Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| This place looks a lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| It looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| I'm not used to you all being so close to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| I appreciate you all's time, and Mr. Smith and Ms. Druten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| I appreciate you all's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| I think this is you all's last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| I appreciate the time and energy you all put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| I respectfully request approve as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| More than likely, the traffic we intend to come off of Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8401)|
| 2:20:08| so I would say even if there is a secondary entrance off of Strawberry Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| the traffic will be coming on to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| Again, I appreciate you all's time and request you approve per staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Yeah, I think this is, I mean, especially being directly on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| I think it's a good location for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| and plus part of it's already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| I think five units an acre is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| I'd like to make a motion to approve planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| with up to five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| because it is consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| Motion by Commissioner Huber, second by Commissioner Barger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| to approve per staff recommendation at five per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| I've had two requests for a quick break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| so we are going to take a five-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| and when we return we'll be on item number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8478)|
| 2:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8508)|
| 2:22:18| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8538)|
| 2:22:49| Are you coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8569)|

| 2:23:05| Is anybody down yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| Probably just waiting for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8587)|

| 2:23:47| Yeah, the fog ball stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=8627)|

| 2:30:39| forestry and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| Proposed use is detached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| There are subdivision variances that are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| which is the reason it was pulled and put for us to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9048)|
| 2:30:53| There's one report, three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| There will be one for the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| one for the alternate design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| and one for the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9066)|

| 2:31:16| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion to approve the requested variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| to increase the maximum number of lots on one side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| without a turnaround from one to two for the portion of Road N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| northwest of Road L intersection with A, B and C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| Do I have to read all of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| We would need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| Yeah, if you look at the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| there are items A, B and C under the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| that would give you reasons that you could support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| from a hardship standpoint, and I would like for you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| if you so choose, to put those in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| A, there is a large depression north of the terminus of Road N| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| and providing a turnaround would extend the paved road surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| into the closed contour of the depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| B, Road N cannot continue north due to a large depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| which is a unique characteristic of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| and C, the granting of the variation will not be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| to public safety, health or welfare because this portion of Road N| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| will be used very little by the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| and does not require a turnaround per the fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| Commissioner Boyer on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9159)|

| 2:32:46| Motion number two would be the alternate design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| I'll make a motion to approve the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| based on the justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| Motion by Smith, second by Boyer on the alternate design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9179)|
| 2:33:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9186)|

| 2:33:08| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Those have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| And the third motion would be the approval of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| Approve the concept plan subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Do I have to read those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| As noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith, second by Commissioner Boyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| to approve the concept plan subject to the 10 conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| noted in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9209)|

| 2:33:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9212)|

| 2:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| So now we are on item number 32 back on the agenda as published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9218)|
| 2:33:47| So that would be file number 6A24C and 6A24DP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9227)|
| 2:33:56| subdivision Catlett Road, subdivision Leonard Development, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| southeast side of Snyder Road, west of Catlett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| approximate acreage is 10.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| The zone is PRK, planned residential up to 4.68 dwelling units for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9246)|
| 2:34:13| The land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| The proposed use is 33 lots subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| single family residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| The number of lots, again, is 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| This would be, again, three motions, one for the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| one for the concept plan, and one for a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| There are variances, one to reduce the K value from 25 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9274)|
| 2:34:42| That would be the one variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| Alternate design standards, there are two noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| and staff has recommended approval for three noted reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9290)|
| 2:35:01| On the variance, approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| and they're recommending that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| for the 33 lots subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| Here on behalf of the applicant, Chris Sharp, 10330 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9315)|
| 2:35:21| Great. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Mr. Sharp, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| Mr. Chairman, I don't see any lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| so I'll make a motion to approve the requested variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| to reduce the K value from 25 to 20 between stations 1 plus 40.22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| and 3 plus 69.02 on Road B based on the following evidence of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| One, the property is somewhat irregularly shaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| and is challenging topographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| The most optimum location of proposed Road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| happens to coincide with the steepest part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| with the HP hillside protection designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| Two, the shape of the property and the location of the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| with respect to the proposed road is unique to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| and has not been created by any person having an interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| And three, granting this variance will not be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| to public safety, health, or welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| as the proposed reduction is in compliance with the AASHTO standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| as stated by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9378)|

| 2:36:32| subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| So made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9394)|

| 2:36:45| Third motion will be the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| I make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| for a residential subdivision of up to 33 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| in the PR zone subject to one condition as stated by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9417)|

| 2:37:26| Ebenezer Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| Scott Smith, S&E Properties LLC is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| Location east side of Ebenezer Road north of Rosemont Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| The approximate acreage is 33.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| The zoning requested or the zoning is PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| plan residential up to four per the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| existing land use, agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| Proposed use is detached residential subdivision, 113 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| This will be today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| or as presented right now, it's two motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| a concept plan and development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| And the staff is currently recommending postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| to the July 11th, 2024 meeting on the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| and development plan for some noted reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| Scott Smith is here as well for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| Not aware of any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| If you'll recall, this is one where we worked really diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| with the neighbors there in Briar Glen and Suburban Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| to work out some conditions for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| As I understand it, and Mr. Reynolds can correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| if I misstate anything, the reason for the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| for the postponement were some changes to our concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| and the issue of having the landscape plan submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| We were actually able to get our landscape plan completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| and submitted yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| So that is now in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| and does comply with all the zoning conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| that were placed on this by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| The conversation, I believe, is really now focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| on there are two roads, Road A and Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| There's three roads in total if you look at the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| that we've passed out that we've submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| Road C is always planned to be a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| and it doesn't require the middle one is Road C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| It doesn't require any variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| As a condition to our contract to purchase this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| from the family, we were committed to doing these connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9585)|
| 2:39:53| to their property to the north, which has not been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| or has not been developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| So they would be able to extend that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| into that property there to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| which I heard some of the commissioners talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| that being something that they would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| some more connectivity, which is a little ironic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| because the neighbors around us did not want connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| into their neighborhoods, but we're asking to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| we do have connectivity to that property in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| as it gets developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| We had proposed to do just temporary turnarounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| hammerheads at those two locations initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| and engineering staff wanted those to be cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| I think there's some question in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| temporary turnarounds has been, hammerheads has been allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| for temporary turnarounds and other concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| but it doesn't specifically say anything about hammerheads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| and subdivision regulation, so there's a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| of whether that is something that would be allowed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| What we have proposed to do is go ahead and cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| the road on Road C, which is the easternmost road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| which is the furthest, it's the longest road up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| and we still want to do a temporary hammerhead on Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| Those would require variances with regard to the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| They're asking for those to be cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| so that would require a variance anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| and we have, and I did pass them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| we did submit yesterday our justifications for the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| to make sure they can be read into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| and adopted into the minutes as required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| I think in the conversations I've had with Mr. Reynolds here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| just while we're taking a break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| they would recommend approval for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| subject to various conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| which we don't have any objection to, we've looked them over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| but we would have to have two variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| and an alternative design standard approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| and the issue would be with this hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| if we could probably take out that word hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| just keep a temporary turnaround and work with engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| work with staff on what that would have to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| and if we have to come back at a later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| and do something different with that one portion, we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| but it wouldn't slow down our ability to do this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| As part of this development, we are doing sidewalks on Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| we've done traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| and we will be paying for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9730)|
| 2:42:13| to the intersection between Ebenezer and Kingston Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9733)|
| 2:42:16| at that location, so we would like to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| and I know the family, they're sitting back here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9739)|
