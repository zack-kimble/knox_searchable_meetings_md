| 0:00:30| On this sheet that they've turned in to show you what a small group we're dealing with here, these contributors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| we had seven people to give $5,000, five people to give $2,500, two to give $1,000, and one to give $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=36)|
| 0:00:47| That's a total of $49,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| And they show they collected $50,858.66 on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| So you've got seven, five, 12, 15 people gave $49,500 out of that $50,858 they've collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=56)|
| 0:01:09| I'm going to deviate once again from what I said originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| Dr. Joe Johnson has to catch a plane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| and I'm going to allow him to go ahead with part of the presentation from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=80)|
| 0:01:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| Commissioner Lambert, I've got to go to Memphis to continue work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I've got a little work to do for the University of Tennessee in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| I will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| I promised Commissioner Strickland that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| You have heard this morning from several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| You've asked a lot of thoughtful questions about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| One question I was asked and was a part of that group, chaired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| You've heard about the meetings we had throughout the county to have that question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| If you wish any changes to be made, what would they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| You've heard about the Baker Center report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| You've had that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| You've heard our conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| You've got the recommendations in your folders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| And what I would simply add to what several people have asked you to do, you do represent your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| You do represent the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| It is your task to look at what's there, decide whether to amend them, change them as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=154)|
| 0:02:41| Our preference would be you would leave them unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| But we're not sitting in your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| That's something you have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| And then we, as a group, who are now working on the petition effort, we'll examine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| look at what you do, and then we'll decide how to go forward, what to go forward with after you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| I appreciate the people you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| I didn't say I'm Joe Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| I live at 5324 Riverbrier Road in the Fourth District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| and been a part of this community for a good while, as a lot of you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| So thank you for listening to us this morning, for your questions, and for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| And, Mr. Chairman, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Thank you, Dr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Mr. Chairman, would it be all right if I ask Dr. Johnson a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Dr. Johnson, I appreciate you coming down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| And I'm sorry we may delay you, but hopefully that plane will wait for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| No problem, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Back in the late fall, I understand you had a conversation with my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| You gave him a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| And during that conversation, I thought you all discussed many of these, I guess, items that are coming for us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| It's my understanding during that conversation that you felt, after talking to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| that maybe at that time it wasn't best to bring it before commission, that there was so much going on at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| A number of folks, as you know, at different times we had asked Knox County one question to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Some people felt it was a good time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Some folks and some members of this commission felt, well, it might not have been a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| Your dad, as you know him and I know him very well, thought some of these ideas were pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| Some of them, he thought, were pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| And so we went ahead and got this information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| And today we're having a discussion, Craig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| and I hope that you all will decide what you wish to do with it as rapidly as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Well, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| But we've kept getting back to this, why this commission never acted sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| Your group has said it's been out there since September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| But, you know, when I hear of a conversation from one of the leaders of the group saying that, you know, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| and this was back sometime late fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Late fall, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Probably November sometime in there, I'm not real sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| saying that, you know, maybe now is not the best time to bring it forward to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| But then some of your group questions why we didn't act sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So I just wanted to explain to some people why, when I have that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| and I do respect you greatly, Dr. Johnson, you know, I felt like you had your reasons for thinking that maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| shouldn't be bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| And at that time, I would simply say certain issues, things floating around as your dad and I talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| maybe it shouldn't have been that week or the following week, but sometime as soon as we could get it before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| But some issues were floating around in the community at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| may have made that not the most appropriate time to sit with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| and let you decide at that particular moment in time to discuss it and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| And then, if I'm correct, sir, I believe you came in with Ms. Hamilton, was it the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| There was a committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| That you all that came before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Kathy, was it the January meeting that you all or December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| It was the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| So and even at that time, although you wanted, it was more, I took it as you were presenting it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| not necessarily asking us to put it on the agenda at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| We were making a presentation, Commissioner, and I don't recall exactly what was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| but I'm sure at some point we said we'd like for you all to consider to act and put this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| But I just wanted to explain a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| That, you know, a very respected part of this group was at one point thinking that maybe before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=433)|
| 0:07:23| or earlier that it wasn't quite right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And given the circumstances of what was going on back in the late fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| I can understand why some of you might think that it wasn't the appropriate time to be discussing some of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| And I think during that period of time, Commissioner, we were, several of us were talking to several of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| about what we'd done and what we'd like for you to do and weighing some of your advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| your suggestions as to what might be done when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Commissioner Smith, you have a question for Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Just while Dr. Johnson is here and go along with what Commissioner Luthold was saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Joe, you came to my office once, if not twice, you came and we sat down and talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| We serve on several boards together and I, like Commissioner Luthold, respect you greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| And we had the conversation at my office and we went through all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| and you were looking at my past political experience, which made me feel good, Dr. Johnson, that you came to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| and said, Larry, what is your political thinking on some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| And we sat there and we looked and it was right after the commissioners were off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| and I said two things, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| I said the same thing with what Commissioner Luthold was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Some like, some we didn't like, but more it was the climate that the commissioners were not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| and especially in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| The fourth district was not even represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| You know, and I just looked at you and said, Joe, you know, not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| I don't think it's a good time because some of the districts aren't even represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| And that's pretty much how we left it and we were going to get back with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| and talk about it, you know, when it would be the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| But I appreciate you coming and talking to me individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Commissioner, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| And in the conversations, I think you said, particularly as we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| there may be a lot of other things on commissioners' mind right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| and you might not have the kind of attention you'd like in presenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| And, Commissioner Strickland, thank you a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| I appreciate all that you all do all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you, Dr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Corey Johns, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| You've got five minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=575)|

| 0:09:50| It's my distinct pleasure to represent the Knox County Republican Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Our esteemed chairman, Irene McCrary, could not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| She's scheduled for a hip replacement tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| Your thoughts and prayers in this matter are invited and appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| At a recent countywide meeting of the board of vice chairmen of the Knox County Republican Party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| the proposed charter amendments before you today became a center of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| It quickly became apparent that much concern existed regarding these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| and an ad hoc committee was formed to examine each individual amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| From the perspective of the Knox County Republicans and the voters at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| my purpose before you this morning is to relay the position of the committee as it relates to these respective amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| After much debate, discussion, and deliberation, the committee chose to take a position on two of the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| The other is it neither supports nor rejects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Concerning the restructuring of the Knox County commission called for in Amendment 101, the committee stands opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| At a time when Knox counties are calling for greater accountability and increased accessibility to elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| the committee finds it curious that the proposed amendment seeks to decrease the size of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| Fewer commissioners mean larger districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Larger districts mean more constituents per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| More constituents mean less accountability from and accessibility to sitting commissioners when it comes to the average Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| In a growing county, decreasing the size of this body by almost 45 percent seems rather counterintuitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Further, the committee firmly opposes the portion of Amendment 101 calling for the election of commission on a nonpartisan basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| We hold that parties represent values and that values are expressed in ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| The recent challenges in Knox County have fallen not along party lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| nor have they affected the makeup of this body substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Democrats and Republicans alike are seated around this table and have found a way to coexist throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| Additionally, this makes even less sense when considering that the offices of mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| and sheriff will apparently remain partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Why is something that's good for the executive branch bad for the legislative branch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| These questions go unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Next, the committee opposes Amendment 105 calling for the restructuring of the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Again, it seems curious that in an environment where greater accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| and accessibility is clearly needed, the proposal calls for disfranchising the voters as it relates to the offices of trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| county clerk, register of deeds, and property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Further, the appointment of these and other department directors by the mayor would bring about an unnecessary consolidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| of power into that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Despite the best arguments of the charter petition group, these amendments effectively serve to decrease accessibility to elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| officials by the many and increase the influence over them by the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Our founding fathers did their best to establish a system of checks and balances where the government was open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| accessible, and accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Many of the measures contained in these two amendments seem to counter those longstanding American ideas upon which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| this nation was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Those are the two amendments that the committee chose to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| And when presented with the option of accepting in whole or rejecting in whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| the committee must respectfully reject the current slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Other amendments do raise concerns, particularly as it relates to qualifications for commission members, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| that they are required to be funded directly or indirectly by the county would necessitate their ineligibility to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=796)|
| 0:13:26| This matter is simply unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Contractors who might have built a county building in the past have indirectly been funded by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| Property owners who might lease a building to the county are indirectly funded by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| I think that goes above and beyond what is called for in the conflict of interest provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| Additionally, the personal interest rather than conflict of interest, simply poor wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| Poor wording leads to lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| This county has seen a lot of lawsuits among the various entities of itself over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| We wish to avoid those in the future as good Republicans who are concerned about the bottom line taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| That's first and foremost on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Finally, I'd like to issue a personal appeal to the caretakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| And by caretakers, I mean those of you who are serving on this body in an appointed fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| who are not on the August ballot for a permanent or for a full term following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| This vote will be your legacy, likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| And I urge you to carefully weigh and consider this decision of these amendments that are before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Good government is seldom the result of hasty decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Knox County has been around for over 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And it will survive if these amendments do or do not make the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| It's been a pleasure to address this body this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your considerations with regard to schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| And unless this body has any questions for me, I'd be happy to take my leave at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Do you have a question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Yeah, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Corey, I appreciate those comments and a lot of good information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| Did you have that as a written out speech or as an outline form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| I'd like, if you could, to get that to Joe Lee and because I want to go over that one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| You had a lot of good points in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| I want to think over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| The bulk of it is written out in a speech format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Or if you don't have a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Expressing the ideas stemming from that committee that was referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Or if you want to go home and come back and retype it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| I'd be happy to submit what I have before you or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Just whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| By e-mail or fax, submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| You had some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| And I want to think over those points again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Just a quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| You mentioned the question of disenfranchising voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Could you please explain the apparent contradiction between saying we should not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| we could disenfranchise voters if we make Register of Deeds, trustee, property assessor, et cetera, appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| But we refuse to put that before the voters to let them decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Well, that is certainly a perspective that is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| But simply, those positions currently, the voters have access to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| They can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| They can choose their elected officials on that platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And to remove that right is what I'm speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| By letting them vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| So your argument is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| By not letting them vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| By making those appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| That's why I'm not clear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Is your statement here, and we keep seeming to confusing these two, against the actual ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| or against letting people vote on the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| The statement regarding disenfranchising voters is with regard to the outcome of that proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| if enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| So are you arguing, let me come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Are you arguing that we should not put these on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Or are you arguing for later down the road that people should vote against them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| I'm relaying the wishes of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| That it stands in opposition to that particular amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| But was silent on the question of whether it should go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| The committee stands in opposition to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| It is for this body to decide whether to put that on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| So you're arguing down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Thank you, Mr. Johns, for coming this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| You speak very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I have a question or two about the committee, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| When was the committee formed and when was this process taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I think a lot of the reason we're here today is because of an accelerated schedule as faced with this August ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| deadline and probably everyone present wishes we had a little bit more time to hash these matters out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| and deal with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| For instance, if it could be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| Faced with this body deliberating on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and the discussion that arose at the recent meeting of the Board of Vice Chairmen of the Knox County Republican Party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| the chairman, Ms. McCrary, nominated a committee among those present who indicated they'd be willing to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| I do not have a list of those individuals who participated in that with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| So this took place in the countywide meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| The committee was formed from those at the countywide meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| And what was the date of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| The actual committee meeting took place this past Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Who were some of the members of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Myself, Michelle Carringer was there, Mark Munford was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1118)|
| 0:18:48| Former Commissioner Leuthold sat in an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| And we appreciated his clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| I need to get the full list of those, of the ladies at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Was there an announcement at the general meeting that this was a committee that was going to be formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| Is that how it was formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| This committee came about as a result of the vice chair meeting that was held approximately two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| May I add that I wish I could stand before you today and say that this was issued in more of an open call form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| I'd greatly desire that and wish that the time constraints had allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| However, necessitating that if the party was going to examine and take a position on these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| or not take a position as we have on seven of them, I believe, that the accelerated schedule must be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| And those are constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I would have liked to have known about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| It seems like your members of, you know, your elected officials that are Republicans would probably have known about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| or gotten some word somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I just knew nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| For that, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| I just wanted to ask a quick question of how many people are in the Republican Party in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| Well, we don't register by party in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| But you have a rough idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Anybody else want to take a guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I mean, are you talking about who's on the e-mail distribution list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Probably 398,000 are Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| I was going to say, is it just me and Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| There's a couple of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Former chairman Turner says that approximately 2,500 people are actively involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| So you would have that pool of people to quarry this information and ask them about these amendments and get feedback from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| That would be people that are actively involved, that are informed, that do pay attention and are engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| I would like to hear their feedback and how they feel on these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| As I stated, this represents the committee that was available from the board of vice chairmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| the meeting stemmed from the board of vice chairmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I do not pretend that this represents the full body, that the entire body has unanimously agreed upon these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| nor has the executive committee at this point in time voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| My purpose here today is simply to relay the information stemming from the committee that was able to be convened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| given the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Well, I would appreciate if you would send on your e-mail list, just ask folks what they're feeling on the content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| not whether or not you can vote individually or as a block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| because I think that's an aside issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| I think we need to discuss the content of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| And so if they could e-mail us or just contact us and let us know, we would greatly appreciate that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| And we certainly look forward to issuing that out and see what kind of result we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| I would like to add that it seems, this seems pretty consistent from the discussion that's been earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| that was held earlier from, I guess, the meeting last night where the information was relayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| that the two amendments that folks, whether it's District 9 or at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| seem to have the greatest issue with are the two that are in reference by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you, Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Mr. Johns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| John Haddon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| This committee come from the chair people that we elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| The precinct vice chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| When was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| The last county-wide convention, which would have been a little over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| A little over a year ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Now, you've had two meetings on this, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I thought you met here a few weeks ago and then you had a meeting last night again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| The no, sir, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| The, as I mentioned, this arose as a topic of discussion at the quarterly vice chair meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| which was approximately two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| A motion was offered and was supported to appoint a committee to look into these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and to craft a position and in the time constraints offer that position for consideration before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| That committee convened on Monday as best of the available schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| And I'd be happy to get a list of the individuals that were signed on to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| But the vice chairs did vote to form this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| The vice chairs at the quarterly meeting, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| John Haddon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1415)|
| 0:23:49| John Haddon, 2315 Monterey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| Roy Johns asked if he could go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I wish I hadn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I forgot how eloquently he spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| And here I've been eating crackers, but I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| I stand here before you today with a great concern over my right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| This group supporting nine counties, blurred vision, or Knox County, one fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| or whatever you want to call it, are trying to make a mockery out of democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| They, in what was the last meeting, in their self-serving, self-absorbed and self-centered way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| are dominating, demanding that those who have been elected or appointed should have no right to legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1481)|
| 0:24:51| unless they vote for the way they want them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| They are very demanding, or at least were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Now they say they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| I don't know which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| My question to this committee, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| They are very demanding or were with the intention of no compromise with the rest of the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and voters that they put people in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| The voters put the people in office, but they don't want the people in office to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I can't go along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| They plan on taking our right to vote on top-level positions and give it to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| The mayor, past, future, or especially present, should not have that kind of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| They also say that in certain cases the people we voted for cannot vote on certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| They don't even have the right to even speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| That is a mitigated goal as far as I'm concerned to go against the First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| and that the legislative body cannot even speak or voice their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| People, as far as I know, that is against federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| They have a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| It's a good thing they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| They may be going to court on federal reasons for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| There are several of these people who have an R next to their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Cory Johns brought this up since he was talking about Republicans that claim to be very, very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1591)|
| 0:26:41| But with this crap storm they're trying to rain down on Knox County, it would appear that instead of acting like East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Tennessee Republicans, they're sounding more like Washington, D.C., Democrats in the form that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| let's take away the right of Joe and Jane Doe and give it to the powers that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| That's plain wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| John Smith said on the radio, thank God the voice is back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| that they had $150,000 donated and another $150,000 on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1627)|
| 0:27:20| People, with that kind of money that is not a donation, that kind of money is investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| Now, I'm told today that has changed from that amount of money down to $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Somewhere a person or persons are working to make a grab for either wealth, power, or trying to hide something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1659)|
| 0:27:50| They're trying to take over the government of Knox County and the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| And they can do it because of the kangaroo court we had over with nine citizens, nine citizens, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| That's the entire population of Knox County, according to that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| But they've been empowered to do so because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| This group, unelected, unappointed, but self-anointed to dictate to Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1694)|
| 0:28:24| and the taxpayers what they are going to do, us as taxpayers and you as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1704)|
| 0:28:34| May God help us all if they get by with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Please, please don't let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| One other thing, it's been said that there was nobody voted against all nine at one of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| I did and the gentleman behind me did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| This group seems to listen to what they want to hear and disregard the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you, Mr. Haddon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| We have one more, Mr. Brian Hornback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| After Mr. Hornback, I'm going to let you get back to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Then we are going back to public forum and any commissioner that has questions can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| My name is Brian Hornback, PO Box 22743, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| I've heard a lot of arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| For the record, there's really only one amendment that I like, and that's the consistency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| The rest of them I have grave concerns about, but I only want to talk about really one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| And it's a point I raised last night at the South Dole Middle School Forum, High School Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| And that is we hear the argument that changing the executive branch takes people's votes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1792)|
| 0:30:02| Changing the executive branch takes away term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| In 1994, the citizens of Knox County voted for term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| In 2006, term limits were enacted by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and Knox County now adheres to term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| By taking the four positions that this group wants to now have as an appointed director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| as an appointed department head of the mayor with confirmation by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| what you're doing is you're taking term limits away from the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| You're taking term limits away from the people who voted for it in 1994, who believed in it through 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| and you're giving these departments to career bureaucrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Now, last night, Brad Hill, a representative of Knox Charter Petition, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| you're assuming that there's this organized, his exact words were something to the tune of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1854)|
| 0:31:02| you're assuming that there's going to be some organized corporate cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| I'll make the case this morning that that's already happened in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| I'll give you the case study, I'll give you the precedent, and I'll give you the benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Former finance director Kathy Hamilton was appointed by Dwight Kessel, a Republican county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| She was appointed and served as finance director for a Democrat county executive, Tommy Shumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| By this amendment being placed on the ballot by citizens voting for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| what you're doing is you're creating long-term government bureaucracy that removes term limits from these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1898)|
| 0:31:47| that will be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| And I heard Mr. Harmon's question, Commissioner Harmon's question to Corey Johns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| and you asked if he was against the amendments, if he was against the putting it on the ballot for the people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| I elect three representatives to represent me here, Commissioner Craig Luthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| Commissioner Mike Hammond, and now Commissioner Richard, Dr. Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| I don't want my county to become a county that's controlled by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| I don't want my county controlled by amendments that are placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| I want my representatives who I elect to represent me, and that's my expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you, Mr. Internal Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you, Mr. Hornbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| We have one more citizen, name off, Gerald Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| Chairman Strickland, I have a question for Mr. Hornbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| I guess I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| You're saying that the fee offices, which was the amendment that you were speaking on, have term limits now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| and they will not going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| What I'm saying, Commissioner McKenzie, is that currently our registered deeds, our trustee, our property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=1990)|
| 0:33:21| and I'm forgetting the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| County clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Currently, those four positions are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| John Whitehead was not able to run for election this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| He was term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| He's property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Mike Lowe, our trustee, was term limited, was not able to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| Steve Hall, who has led the ticket in Knox County every year since he was first elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| was not able to run for registered deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| They are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| By the citizens, by you placing this amendment on the ballot, by the citizens approving this executive reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| what's going to happen is the county mayor is going to be able to appoint, you as commissioners can confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| the individuals that serve in those four positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| There's nothing in this charter amendment that prohibits someone from serving under two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| or three different county mayors, as is in the case of former finance director, Kathy Hamilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| serving for a Republican county executive and a Democrat county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| I guess my question probably should be to the law director that just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| But it looks like in the conclusion of the Jordan decision that they're quoting two clerks that are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| and the school board that aren't covered under the term limit provision that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| So I'm just, again, generally trying to understand where there seems to be some discrepancy in what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| and what I'm reading here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I think, you know, certainly from my perspective, and I'm not the lawyer nor the son of a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| but certainly what the case said was that you, Knox County, can decide whatever form of government it chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2098)|
| 0:35:10| So by placing this on the ballot, Commissioner, you are choosing to take term limits away from the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| on these four positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| There will be five, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Mr. McKenzie, the two clerks that were exempt from that is the criminal court clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| and the circuit clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| And that's because the state sets those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| That's why they become exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| But he's completely correct on what he's telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Commissioners, thank you for letting me be here today and speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| I came in with a little note card about that big business card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Now I'm up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| But I'm not going to talk long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| I promise I'll be short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I always have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| So let me just express from my heart what I think some of these amendments are doing to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2157)|
| 0:36:07| You know, I was in scouting for many, many years and worked with Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| And I remember one night in particular that we were trying to tell the guys what to do if they were lost in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| And one of the little Boy Scouts back there that was supposedly one of the smarter ones was listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And I said, all right, Johnny, what would you do if you were lost in the woods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| And he raised his hand and said, okay, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| He said, when in danger, when in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| So I hope that as a county commission that you don't end up doing that with the influx of all this information that's coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| And I'm speaking to you as someone who's been in this county for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| been active around the county a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And I think that I have a lot of feedback and a lot of information coming to me even outside of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| And each one of you represent districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| And I just feel like that I have a lot of information coming to me from different sides of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| business-wise and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Some of the members that are on this committee are my very, very dear long life friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| And that doesn't necessarily mean I disagree with everything they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| But I do disagree with some of the amendments and most all of the amendments that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| We certainly want to thank the commission for strengthening your nepotism policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| for strengthening your ability to rule over the conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| And I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I think this commission has really made some inroads into streamlining county government, helping county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| And to come up with these, a lot of these amendments, that to me almost seem ludicrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| All of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Some of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I do not like the nonpartisan issue, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| because I think that the people need to speak as a unit that gives us check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| and balance because of our Democrat and Republican representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| I do not like the cutting the county commission down to nine members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| because I think that you're losing some of your representation by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| There's a bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I'm not going to go through all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| But one of the things I would say to you is I would just encourage you to vote against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Let's not even put them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| And then if they decide they want to put them on the ballot, let them seek petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| But I can see no reason to put these things on the ballot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I'm going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I said I was going to speak shortly and I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| And, Mr. Chairman, thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And I don't guess anybody's got any questions because I've not seen anything worth asking questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| But please know, please know that as an individual, as a businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| and as a person that's involved in the community, I'm opposed to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And I have not seen any groundswell that is pushing these things to go on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| or any groundswell that is moving out in the county to make these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| We have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you, Gerald, for coming to speak to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| And as a fellow Republican, I share a lot of common values with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I think that we do have some fundamental issues here, and I'd just like for you to address that again, Mr. Hornback did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| So, fundamentally, for me, I do not see, I do not have any problem whatsoever with allowing all nine of these to be voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2366)|
| 0:39:36| on by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| And so, from your perspective, why is that not what we should be doing on this legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| I never have any problem with anybody voting on anything, and I think that's the way democracy exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| And I think that's the important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| I think to bring them before you and to push you and threaten you into putting these on the ballot because of threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| and intimidation, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Let them go ahead and get petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Let them go ahead and put it out there if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| I don't see any, I don't feel any kind of threat or pressure or anybody leveraging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| I really haven't had any or almost no information coming from our district, which we share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| We don't live very far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| And so, I do tend to feel somewhat like Ms. Hamilton said, when there's not a negative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| or a large negative response, people that are calling that are in opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| I tend to feel that people are okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| And so, that's just where I am right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| I voted for putting every one of those nine on the ballot because I feel like that's the right thing to do and let people decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| Well, that's certainly your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| But, you know, I wouldn't give any credence to any of these amendments by putting them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| And I know you're not necessarily saying that, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| But I don't think they're worth giving credence to to put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| I think that if this group wants to get petitions, get them signed, present them, force it on the ballot, that's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| Mr. Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I had one other comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| And that's well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| And I just somehow feel like the whole issue is really born of an outrage against what's happened in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2483)|
| 0:41:33| in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| And, therefore, this is another opportunity for the community to come out, to debate, to vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| We're vetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| This process is a vetting, as well as the last commission meeting and the previous committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| We are vetting these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Dr. Briggs brought up probably my most serious objection had to do with the school board districting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| And so these are all good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| And this is, I think, a process that needs to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| But I appreciate your position, Mr. Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Commissioner Norman, you may not have heard from your constituents, but I have heard from mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| And I've heard from, I would say, from many of the different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| And I've heard a great deal of them say they don't even want them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| So that's the perspective I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Is that I have heard from, I would have to say, hundreds of people that don't believe that a lot of these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2562)|
| 0:42:54| deserve to even be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| And that's, you know, and that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Mr. Gerald, I'm going to have to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| And I've got cause, too, that's told me to tell the people to spend that $150,000 to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| Commissioner Norman, we had the term limits thing on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| These people done it with grassroots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| That showed that they wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| They got out and got the --they didn't raise this money from 10 or 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| They got grassroots people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| The same thing happened here on the wheel tax thing that we got put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| These were people that got out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Now, if these people want this, it should be very easy for them to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| They've got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| They're going to hire professionals to circulate these petitions that know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| These other two deals that were put on there, it was done by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| They didn't raise any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| They didn't have anybody supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| They got out on the street corners and they managed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Let these people show us that they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I did not have anybody on the wheel tax to put any pressure on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| or talk to me about getting it on the agenda, I mean on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| I don't know of anybody that approached the county commission when I was serving here and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| we need to put that on the ballot to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| The people went out and went to work and got it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| And that's the way I think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| And then you know for a fact then the people have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| But what these people are doing, like I showed you there, they've raised $50,885, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| Forty-nine thousand and five hundred come from 15 people, from 50 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| They're going to take this money and promote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Now, I sold for a living all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And you can sell people anything if you've got enough to do it, money to do it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| That's just like you'd be surprised it's poor old people sitting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| buying all these little novelties off of the TV because it looks like it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| You can promote something to where anybody here will buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| It may take more money for me to sell you to get the idea across to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| than it does Gerald Turner down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| But if you give me the money, I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| We have a question for Mr. Turner, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Now, more of a comment to follow up on what Paul was saying about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| There's corporate contributions listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| What I'm wondering is, and Mr. Hatton said earlier, that when you spend this kind of money, that it's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2731)|
| 0:45:40| And I'm just wondering what these corporate contributions are about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and whether they do business with Knox County or whether they will also sign a pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| saying they're not going to seek to do business with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Is this an investment that someone has made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Also, if you look at these top, these $5,000 contributions, these don't look like charitable contributions to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| They look like investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| These are corporate folks that have an interest in what goes on in Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| and it looks like that they're making a substantial investment in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| And I'm wondering, is it even legal to accept corporate contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Because I don't think we commissioners can accept corporate contributions when we're running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2784)|
| 0:46:33| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I just have a comment, and it may seem paradoxical that I'm agreeing both with Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| and Commissioner Norman, but I think this gets back to the point about how some of these amendments need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| I'm concerned that if we go through the petition process, we'll get a bad amendment on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| that might get voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| And that's why I think it's very important for us to vet these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| and be certain that when we put them on there, they're what's good for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| and they're what's good for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I have all the faith in the world that the people have the right to vote, but I think that some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| there's complexities and there's subtleties in here that we need a law director to look at that we need to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| And when we put them on there, they're more likely to pass that they do what they're intended to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| rather than to do what they're not intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And that's why I do think some of these need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| The other issue that I have is do we need to drop some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| And this will come up as we go through these individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| It's probably the ones that I would support the most on some of these ethics and conflict of interest issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| and nepotism issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And if this is handled by the Ethics Committee, do we really need to put them on the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Because some of that may distract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I know if you're a citizen going through all of these and you have these long amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| you get tired of reading them and you may not really look at the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And we can talk about that and there may be some good arguments against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| But I do think that some of these may need to be tweaked to avoid lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| And it may help to get the good ones passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| It will help to make the bad ones better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| But we do have to be very careful that we get things passed that we really don't want on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| Thank you, Mr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Mr. Hamilton, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| Gary Drenham, 10300 Ivy Hollow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| That's Knoxville 3793 once in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| I'd like to answer my commissioner's question about the corporate contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| resident of the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| It is an investment for a corporation to spend this kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| It's an investment for an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| It's an investment, though, in the type of government that they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| As someone that's traveled around the country and other places recruiting businesses to come to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| as many of you know, I've worked in real estate development for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| And as someone who sat across the table from someone asking them to consider moving their company to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| to relocate into some business, to doing business in Knox County, the government is always a question that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| What sort of government representation do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| What sort of folks read what happens in government and communities they're thinking about reading or moving to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| So when there's an article in the New York Times that says maybe some things that folks may think is unflattering about a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| it can affect the viability of that community to go out and recruit that business, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| And so I think that issues like that cause people to make that investment that are involved in the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| I think that's why we see folks involved in the business community make contributions to campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| I know you've accepted many contributions from business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| And because of the organization, the way it's structured, we are able to take corporate donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| And obviously some folks choose to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| Okay. Who is strategic partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| I notice here they gave $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| That's not Tyler Harbour's company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| His had strategic something written in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| I can assure you that I've not had any contact with Tyler Harbour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| I don't know who that company is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| We can certainly find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Somebody gave you all $5,000, nearly ten percent of your total budget, and you don't know who they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| We've collected donations online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| There's no way I could go through and tell you who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I don't think a five grand donation came online, I assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| If I give somebody $5,000, I want to look them in the eye and them to know who's giving them the five grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| And, Commissioner, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Culver Schmidt, who is our treasurer, had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I'm certain he can answer your question if he were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| And, therefore, we don't have the appropriate person here to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| We can certainly get you the answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| How about this BevTel Camp Automation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| What business are they in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Automation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Hydraulics, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| It's Hank and Bert Bertelkamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I think they used to call the business Bertelkamp Power and Fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| I'm not sure exactly what the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Was he the chairman of the Knox County Development Corporation at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I don't know, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Yes, he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I mean, that's just what I'm looking here, and I'm not seeing grassroots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| What I'm seeing, based on these numbers, I'm seeing politicos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| I'm seeing folks that, again, this just really looks like you've got a certain group of folks that want to take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| Knox County government using this as a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| The next person, Commissioner, if we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Pete Claussen is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| At least I think he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Oh, no, he did have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Pete Claussen was here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| He was going to talk to you about the Baker Center contract and about the results of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| I apologize that he's no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| He had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| You do have the Baker Center report in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Mr. Claussen is one that came into the group and asked that this contract be put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| He worked with the Baker Center to fund this research through the Seven Islands Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| and they did the research and they gave that report to him and, in turn, then to the Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| So I think what we would like to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| I talked to Pete, so I think I know what he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| He did have to leave just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Seven Islands Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Pete Claussen is a resident of the Ninth District to start off with, Seven Islands neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| Seven Islands Foundation is a foundation that his family formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| It is best known in Knox County for making the donation of the land for the Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| which is the largest donation of public of land to public sector in Knox County history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| If you've not been out there, it's a spectacular piece of land out in East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and, in fact, will expand over the river into South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| Pete was asked by Knox County one question to consider funding the Baker Center report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| I think you've got the responses from the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| I've got a copy that Commissioner Norman requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| In there, I think it asked the question, how did it come about that the Baker Center did that research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| And Knox County one question asked Pete Claussen, once we found out that the Baker Center would be willing to do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| and what it would cost, asked if the Seven Islands Foundation would fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| He funded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| I'm not finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| What page is the Seven Islands Foundation contribution on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| If you're referring to the responses to Commissioner Norman's 14 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| The donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| It's not on the donation list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| It's on the donation list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| How much was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| The research, I think, this was back last year for Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| The research last year, I think, was in the range of about $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| That was funded directly by the Seven Islands Foundation to the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| They did not direct in any way how the Baker Center did the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Knox County one question did not direct in any way how the Baker Center would do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| They developed the methodology themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| The Baker Center did, and they've described what that methodology is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| An excerpt from the research project is in your notebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| That's the chapter that really was done to summarize the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| If anybody would like a full copy of the research project, it is online several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| We'd be glad to, of course, copy it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| If you need us to do it, it's online at the Baker Center website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| It's online at knoxcharterpetition.com, the full research project and its attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| What we've copied for you in the notebooks, in just the interest of giving you something that's more readable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| is the one chapter that was prepared to be a summary for summarizing their findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| And I think the key point that Pete wanted to communicate to you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| that that research was done solely for the purpose of documenting three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| One is existing conditions in government structure for all three of the governments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Number two, comparing Knox County to 160 comparable counties outside the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| And number three, to look at best practices in about eight, I think, comparable counties for best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3356)|
| 0:56:05| that have been recognized as such by various governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| and seeing how those compare to Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| The research was provided then back to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| It was released publicly, I think, on August 1st of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| It was publicized widely in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| It was available online from that point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| It was utilized in the steering committee retreat for Knox County, one question, on, I believe, August 12th of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| in their full retreat where they used the public input from the public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| and the research from the Baker Center to come up with the final recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| that were then publicized to the community on September 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| So, any questions you've got about the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| Because it was to Knox County, one question, to the Knox Charter Petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| Knox County, one question, went out of business when it published its report September 9th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| Knox Charter Petition got organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Some of the former members of Knox County, one question, are part of Knox Charter Petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| but many more people are, and folks that were a part of that are not a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| So, the funding for Knox County, one question, was predominantly about the only expense Knox County, one question, had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| Everything else was volunteer, was this research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| And we've given you the information about the funding for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| which is directly from Seven Islands Foundation to the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| The Baker Center got the Knox County, one question, charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| Pete Clausen asked the Baker Center to do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| He funded the research for the purposes of that research being available to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| and for the process for Knox County, one question, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| Any other questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| This steering committee retreat that you all took where you made the final decision as to what the recommendations were going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3501)|
| 0:58:31| was this sunshined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| It was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| There were no public officials whatsoever involved in the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| No, actually, even no employees of any of the governments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| The qualifications that we, when we went out and recruited steering committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Commissioner Lambert, for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| You can call me Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| When we went out and recruited steering committee members for Knox County, one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| back in about February and March of 2007, last year, the requirements we were looking for were basically three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3539)|
| 0:59:08| One was they were not an elected official of any government in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| Number two, they were not an employee of any government of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| And number three, number three, that they were, the sort of profile we were looking for were informal mayors of Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| people who would be respected at the baseball dime and respected in their neighborhoods, respected in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| So what you're saying, this was a pretty exclusive crowd, that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| It was intentionally designed to not have any conflicts of interest involved in answering the one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| Well, here's my problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| You're billing yourself as you're a grassroots movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| And like I said, I've been involved in grassroots movements my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| I've been involved with Tennessee Conservative Union, fighting the state income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| I've been involved with the wheel tax petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| I've been involved with numerous grassroots causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Yet what it looks like is you've got an elitist group of folks that you handpick on your steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| The final, and I'd like for you to answer this, sir, the final decision for what these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| what you were going to ask us to put on the ballot was not made by the grassroots folks out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| They were made by a group in a private meeting that was not sunshined, that the press was not invited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| with a select group of people that you hand selected that, quote, met your criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| Yet you bring this to us, and last month you were pretty insistent that we put this on the ballot in whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| without legislating it when this, we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| As the legislative body, we don't meet at secret retreats and have select committees of only special people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| It's open up to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Everything we say is recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| You know, we're here and we even stopped this meeting because it wasn't being broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| You bring these things to us that were refined at a private meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| and you ask us just to drop them on the ballot without any debate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| Commissioner, what I will tell you about that retreat is that there were no new ideas put forward in that retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3689)|
| 1:01:38| There are two things that have ended up being summarized after the retreat that the group found out about and circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| One was the consistency amendment that was brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| and added on at the suggestion of the attorney that was working with the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| And the second one was the suggestion to take the number of voters required to get a petition back from 15 percent of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| registered voters down to 15 percent of those voting in the last county general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| as it originally was when the charter was put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| What the group did at this retreat was basically only take the ideas that had come from the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| and lay those ideas next to the Baker Center research and match those up and see where they matched up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| And where they matched up, come forward with those to see how many ideas that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| and then basically ask that steering committee, here are the ideas that have come from the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| Here's how they match up to the Baker Center report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Is this something that you can support coming together in a petition or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| in a recommendation from this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| And that was the purpose of that retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Rather than trying to gather together several hundred people and compose a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| that's what that report, that steering committee retreat was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Ms. Hamilton, how many more presenters do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Well, sir, we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| We lost a few folks along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| The only other thing that we wish to do is if you want us to take questions on the ordinances at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| we can do that or we can have our last presenter, and I think that's probably what we should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| and let him make his presentation and then we'll take all other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Mr. DeFreeze, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| You know, I was looking through here the summary and conclusions, and maybe this is more of a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| but I think this is something that we could actually arrive at a consensus about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| It says, if government is to be citizen-directed, the public must be afforded the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| to develop specific ideas about how it can be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And I know that you all feel that you all have justified that and you have substantiated that claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| but then there's people on commission that have questioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| Something else in here, it says, still another timeless but important method of measuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| and accessing service performance and effectiveness are regular citizen surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| And so I really look forward to hearing from everybody's forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| I think that's going to be something that we need a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| And it says here that our research indicates that citizen-driven governments are given more favorable performance ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| And I just really feel and I know that there's a lot of pressure on you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| and I really enjoy the information in this report, and I know that a lot of effort has gone into this in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| But I really feel that we need more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| and I really feel that putting us all underneath a gun for something to arrive on the August ballot may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| as Commissioner Briggs mentioned, may actually, we may actually arrive at a product that maybe it's not really something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| that we would all agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| So I don't want to knock out everything and say it's not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| I think that there's some validity in some of these amendments has been brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and I really feel like we just need time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| So I just wanted to say that I appreciate this, and I'm taking note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| And at this point I'm going to ask Abe Brown to come up and talk about where we think we would go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3918)|
| 1:05:31| Yes, it is still morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Abe Brown, 7000 Sage Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I'm just here to explain, summarize the next steps as identified in the packet that you should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| On February 27th, Knox County Election Commission was informed that KnoxCharterPetition.com will submit alternative petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| consistent with Knox County Commission's first reading vote with the request that the Election Commission approve those petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| on March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| After March 25th, the petitions cannot be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| From that point forward, we will have 74 days to gather the required signatures needed to place the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| on the August ballot, and that is the next steps from March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| That's where we stand at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| A question that was asked earlier is why not the November ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| And I'll just reiterate, the November ballot is not a county general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| Can I stop him right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| I'm sorry to interrupt, but, Ms. Law Director, could you correct that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| Because the charter says we can do it during a state election, which the November ballot would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| The charter as it exists at the present time under Section 8.05e allows charter amendments to be on the ballot at either the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4006)|
| 1:06:59| next regular state or county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| And if you will recall, many of the amendments that were enacted in 2006 through the efforts of the Charter Review Committee were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4023)|
| 1:07:14| on the ballot in November of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So under the Charter, as it exists today, these amendments could appear either on the county election in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| or at the state election in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| And we all know there will be elections in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you, Ms. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Could I ask, David, after the November election, when the next state or general election would be after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Is it 2-2-2-10, nothing in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| Probably in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| The city may have elections in 2009, but I don't know whether those will be considered county general elections or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4071)|
| 1:08:02| So I think that 2010 will be the next county general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| Because all these positions that are being filled in August of 2008, well, many of them, are just being filled to complete the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4090)|
| 1:08:21| terms of commissioner, sheriff, register, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| And in 2010, then those positions are coming up under the normal election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4106)|
| 1:08:36| In response to what your earlier comment was regarding November elections, I'm not an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| and I'm going to hand that response over to our counsel, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4123)|
| 1:08:56| This is one of those cases, and there are several of these, in which the Knox County Charter is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| and state law trumps it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| And it is true that the language in the charter would suggest that it could be held at the November election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| but state law, which deals with petition drive resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| says that it has to be held at a county general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| And November is not a county general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| That is a state election, which is separately defined under the election code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| So under TCA Section 2-5-151, which governs petition drives and referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| it must be on a county general election, and August is the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| I guess here again, and I've asked this question before, when does the charter trump the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| and when does the state trump the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| And we continue to get varying legal opinions about which state laws we have to follow in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4197)|
| 1:10:07| and which state laws we can change with our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| It's like we're trying to pick and choose which laws we want to obey by the state and which ones we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| And I just, that's part of the confusion that I think that not only I, but some of the other commissioners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| What state laws do we have to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Are we going to cherry pick them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| The answer is that's how the law works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| That's how the law works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| The charter never trumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| You mean I can pick which ones I'm going to follow and not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| Because I'd really like to drive a little faster than 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Well, sir, you just said that the charter never trumps state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| If I could explain, there is a hierarchy among state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| If the Constitution always wins, then you go to the state statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| and the state statutes permit some flexibility to counties to the extent they are not inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| with general state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| So there are certain things that the county can do that are not inconsistent with general state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| And if it is inconsistent, you can't do it by charter or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Now, I'm going to tell you, sir, that one of your petitions, one of your amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| is in direct conflict of a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| Which one is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| That would be the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Not under the statute as interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Well, sir, I'm going to have to disagree with you because it specifically says that a county employee can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4294)|
| 1:11:44| and that's a qualification, can serve on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| And I understand why you would take a sincere interest in that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| But if I could complete my answer, the answer is the way the courts have interpreted that statute is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| that qualifications for office is one of the issues that counties are permitted to determine by charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| The Bailey case indicates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| The Jordan case confirms that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| And in that case, an employment-based qualification for office is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| Now, what the Bailey case talks about, sir, is placing a qualification that is non-discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| Anybody that serves on this body cannot serve more than two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| That affects everybody, no matter what they do, where they work, or any other way you want to classify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| It gets 100 percent of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| You're talking about a qualification that discriminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| It's a qualification that the state has enacted that you want to say that we have one state law that says a qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4361)|
| 1:12:52| Now, the Bailey case talked about the reason why we can term limit office holders is because the state law was silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4372)|
| 1:13:02| That's why we can't term limit school board members, and we can't term limit the judicial side of the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4382)|
| 1:13:13| We can't do the court clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| We can't do the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| We can't do the public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| We can't term limit the attorney general because there was laws that specifically said you can't term limit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4399)|
| 1:13:27| Now we have a law that specifically says you can't term limit employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| But we can get into this further because your amendment goes much further than employees does it not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| The amendment on which specific one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| The qualification amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| I'd like to read the state law here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| You'd like me to read it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| You might want to grab another mic if for some reason yours isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| 5-5-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| C, notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| any county employee otherwise qualified to serve as a member of the county legislative body shall not be disqualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| from such legislative office by reason of being a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| Thank you, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| In direct contracts to state law, so on one hand you want to say we have to follow state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| and on another hand that you want your group wants to not follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And I can point out other instances, but I just find it very inconsistent and very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| And I think it's confusing not only to me but other commissioners why in some cases we're going to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| In other cases, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| And your amendment, sir, also talks about those people that are going to get compensation either directly from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| or indirectly from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| And how far reaching is indirectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| And who gets to decide that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| That's not what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| It does, too, sir, say if they're funding from compensation indirectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| It says whose compensation Knox County is required to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| Directly or indirectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| There is only one other entity that I know of that Knox County is required to fund, and that is the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| Now, we, well, you know, who gets to decide who that indirectly is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| The question is who you're required to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Well, we fund a lot of bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| How about PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| You're not required to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| But who's going to decide what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| What required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Yeah, who gets to decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Who, sir, gets to decide legal issues in this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Your law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| And your law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Our law director gets to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Under your scenario, sir, who would appoint the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| Under this one, it would be appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Well, who do you think that law director is going to listen to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| I am not interested in having that type of debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| If you'd like to ask me some questions that relate to a legal nature, I'm happy to respond to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| But I don't particularly think this is productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| If someone else does, I'm happy to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Well, you know, my point is that we have, under this scenario, we would have an appointed law director by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4594)|
| 1:16:43| getting to decide possibly who can and who cannot serve on county commission, the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| I find that very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Mr. McAdams, are you stating that you disagree with the one question that these charter members can be on the November ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4611)|
| 1:17:02| Yes, I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| You disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| I think they must be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I'd call Greg McKay, the election commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| Now, that's if they are put on the ballot by the petition process, they must be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4635)|
| 1:17:25| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| By the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| The charter would permit you to put them on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| But to put them on by petition, they have to go on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| I thought that's what we were here for, talking about us putting them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Yeah, I understood the question to be, can they be put on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| Can this group put them on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Can Knox County, one question, put them on the November ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| And, Commission, the reason that this came forward with the August ballot was because this group didn't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| commission was going to put on the ballot and what commission was not going to put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| And we had to preserve the right to go forward on the August ballot if there were no amendments put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| or if some of the amendments were not put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| I'll tell you right now that as far as this group is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| for those amendments that you're willing to put on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| as long as we have that commitment, I think we'd be happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| We would only look at the August ballot with the things that had to be put on by petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| I mean, we feel like it's better to give more time and it's better to have them on the presidential ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4712)|
| 1:18:41| Mr. McKay, from the election commission perspective, this body can put it on the November ballot, the charter amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4721)|
| 1:18:55| I'm really not qualified to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| My understanding is it says to put it on a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I suppose the August election and the November election are general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Well, we had heard the law from our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| She had read it and said that this body could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I just wanted to get some substantiation from your commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| Mary Ann, didn't you say we did that once before November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| In November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Could you read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| In November of 2006, the amendments to the charter that were proposed by the charter review committee were placed on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4764)|
| 1:19:35| Now, as I look at the charter as it exists today, of course, you know there are several ways to amend the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| and one is by voter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Section 8.05C governs the process of amending the charter by voters of the county may frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4785)|
| 1:19:55| and propose amendments to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| The last sentence of Section C says when the county election committee determines that such petitions are legally sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4799)|
| 1:20:09| it shall submit them to the voters of the county in accordance with Section 8.05E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4809)|
| 1:20:18| When I flip to 8.05E, it reads the county election commission shall submit any charter amendment certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4818)|
| 1:20:28| and delivered to it in accordance with 8.05 to the voters of the county at the next regular state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4828)|
| 1:20:36| or county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| As I sit here right now, I do not find a distinction in the charter between amendments proposed by the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4838)|
| 1:20:49| or amendments proposed by a charter review committee or amendments proposed by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| Section 8.05E controls when they can be placed on the ballot, and it says at the next regular state or county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4857)|
| 1:21:08| Well, Greg, if that's been certified once before, you certified it, and you may not have the answer today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| but can you get an opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Well, I would rely on the law department for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| I think the answer is it can be put on the November ballot by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| Or by the petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| The petitioners have to be in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Is that not what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Can the petitioners put it on the November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Is that not what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| As I read the charter, the petitioners can put it on November as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| because 8.05C is the paragraph that addresses charter amendments by petitioners or voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| and then the last sentence of C then refers us to 8.05E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4916)|
| 1:22:05| and E is the paragraph about the timing and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| the election commission shall submit the charter amendments to the voters at the next regular state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| or county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| I was one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Greg, this isn't for you, but I was one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| It voted to place all nine of these on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| And one reason was so that we could get to discussions like this about these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| And my recommendation after spending an hour plus last night, plus the hours we've spent today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4975)|
| 1:23:05| is that this body work as a legislative body to correct or amend the language on several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4985)|
| 1:23:19| There are several of these that I personally have issues with, and I haven't made that any secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| But after hearing all the questions, all the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| I think the only way that the commission is going to get to any type of consensus to put these on the ballot is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| to do some wordsmithing that we feel like more accurately reflects what our constituency has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| The other night, Commissioner Ballard, Commissioner Briggs, and I were at the West Knox Republican Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| and we probably had, what, 60 people or better there that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| And I just thought, well, at the end of the meeting, I was going to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| And when I did, there wasn't anything that was listened to more closely than what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| And none of the three of us addressed it negatively or positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| We just put it out there and let the people make comments back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| And it was pretty obvious that the wording of a lot of these concerned the vast majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| And anyone that's ever been to that club knows, you know, that's a well-educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| well-heeled group of individuals that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| So, you know, it wasn't people that wasn't in the know, but they were appalled at some of the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| the fact that some of these amendments had numerous items that intertied that some of the language made for a great amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5082)|
| 1:24:53| And when you added the other stipulations to it, it made it something that they were vehemently opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| And that's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| That's the recommendation I'm going to stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| And I don't know how everyone else feels about that, but that's what I would like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| Well, Commissioner, I think that the charge to the group that's working with this is to try and go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| and re-energize those folks that came out on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| and to get as many of those people as possible back involved into the conversation that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| The whole point of this originally was to get the public in Knox County interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| and active in and discussing their government and what they wanted from their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| And we've certainly had a lot of debate since this was originally put forward for the new commission body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And I think we've got people talking out in the public about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| And in the end, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| I think that's what the point of all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| And I think we'll continue to have debate as we go forward, whichever election this gets put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| And I think that's the way the process is supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Well, and, Kathy, I think all of us would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| And I know you're politically active and you do a great job as do most of the people that's in your group that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5166)|
| 1:26:14| But government's always better when people are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| It's not good when people just rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| That becomes a monarchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| And, you know, with just the comments I've had since I've been a commissioner on this, which hasn't been that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5182)|
| 1:26:31| you know, a lot of the people didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| And with more dialogue, there is more understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| And I think just like with the commissioners that are on this body, you know, as we've discussed it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| Larry Gluethal has brought up a lot of good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Mr. Pinkston has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Mr. Lambert has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| I mean, there's been a lot of people that's asked a lot of questions that, to be honest with you, I might not have asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| You know, it might not have come to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| And as Mr. Ford once said, none of us is as smart as all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| And I think that, again, the more people involved, the more ideas, the better we can make these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| You know, I've said from the beginning, these seven months of those of us who have been appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| along with the other 11, is going to determine what Knox County government looks like 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Commissioner McAdams said something during his discourse that brought up a point or some problems that I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5245)|
| 1:27:35| one in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| And hopefully what he said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| So I was going to ask the law department, is that a true statement that only the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| or the entities that are required to be funded by the county are applicable to that indirectly statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| Because I did have problems with that indirectly because, you know, that can be very nebulous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| and reach out in places that we really didn't intend for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| So is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| The language is whose compensation is required to be funded directly or indirectly by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| Now, Mr. McAdams apparently interprets that very narrowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| and he believes that it only applies to the county itself and the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5301)|
| 1:28:28| I can imagine a situation where persons or entities with whom Knox County contracts may take the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5308)|
| 1:28:39| well, you're required to fund us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| You entered into the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| You said you would pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| Show us the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| If that's the position that some people take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| then the word require could be a lot larger than Mr. McAdams would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| Certainly once the county enters into a legitimate contract with an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| and we have many contracts with persons that we are then required to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| that may be compensation required to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| This may be one of those sentences that is hard to determine its breadth as we sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| Yes, and that's one of my issues, and I think a lot of people are in agreement with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| Commissioner Daniels, I'm in agreement with you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| It would be good for us to work with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| But from the petition committee standpoint, I understand, I mean, bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| I understand that we can potentially drag this on even past the November process if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5386)|
| 1:29:56| So there probably needs to be some serious commitment on our parts if they're going to be willing to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5396)|
| 1:30:05| And then, again, this whole legal interpretation piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| But in going with what Commissioner Hammonds kind of itemized in District 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5408)|
| 1:30:15| and, you know, I haven't had my open forum, public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| as far as how people in District 1 are viewing these nine proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| But in talking with people, the six are, the six that seem like came out of District 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| that were fairly heavily weighted toward putting on the ballot, I don't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| It looks like 106 and 102 are going to be the ones within the first district that people will have problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5440)|
| 1:30:48| putting those on the either August or November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| And I'm still gaining some kind of feel from the people in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5455)|
| 1:31:03| But I guess what I'm saying is if it comes to August or November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| I think we're all in favor of November to get as much public input as we would like and as they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| But I do think it requires some commitment on our part to work with the people in the phrasing of those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| in particular, as well as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| I guess this is 108, things like that, and it came out of 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| And, Commissioner McKenzie, maybe what I need to do is, if you all would allow me to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| is ask Mr. McAdams to come back up just to make sure that from the standpoint of talking about this election in the August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5496)|
| 1:31:46| or the November that we could finish that conversation because I'm not qualified to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| Let me respond to Mr. McKenzie's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| And that is I do agree completely that amendments of the type that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| if something needed clarification, a point like that, if we needed to say specifically school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| or if we needed to say are required to be funded by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| which does require that or something like that, that those amendments are legally permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| You can certainly make them on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| And I think it would still fall within the scope of the original caption, the original ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| and therefore would still constitute a second reading when you considered it next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| So I think that type of amendment is perfectly legal and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| My understanding on how the timing of the election works is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| And this, Mr. Leuthold, is one of those very complicated of what trumps what issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| But this statute makes it pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Any governmental entity having a charter provision for a petition for recall, referendum, or initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| or any person acting pursuant to such a charter provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| and that's what we're talking about with the committee now is a charter provision for a referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5585)|
| 1:33:13| shall meet the requirements of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| So this is TCA Section 25151.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| So this one is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| The charter can't trump it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| It applies to charter forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| And it says the question, a petition for recall, referendum, or initiative shall be filed at least 60 days before a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5607)|
| 1:33:38| general municipal or county election may be held on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| The question contained in the petition filed less than 60 days before an upcoming general municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| or county election will be placed on the ballot of the following general municipal or county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5630)|
| 1:33:58| And there is no county election in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| You still contend that it needs to be in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| The petition draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| This is the petition draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| I'm just saying for your purpose, you still contend, being their attorney, that they still need to pursue the August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5648)|
| 1:34:17| I'm saying they do not have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| You're saying they do not have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Of putting it on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| You do, I think, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| We have a little piece of business that we need to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| Mr. Freeze, do you want to withdraw your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| That is, your motion was to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Oh, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Aren't we being televised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| That's tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Well, don't table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Just withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Let's take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| And I'm just going to say, just to make sure that since we've kind of talked about different dates and different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| the group is perfectly willing for this commission to put any amendments that they choose to on the November ballot in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5702)|
| 1:35:10| give us more time and to give the public more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| I think that what we would have to do because of the fact that our deadlines would still run through the August ballot is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5713)|
| 1:35:22| would have to begin with the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| But then when you put it on for the November ballot, those petitions would not be turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| And I think that's what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| We would try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| So basically because of that, so that we can know where we stand and know what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| if the body is willing to go ahead and pass on second reading at your March meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| those items that you want to put on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| then that sends a clear message to us and that lets us know what we need to go on with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| But we are perfectly fine with you putting those on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| We just don't have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| What I'm hearing here is that they want a lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| How could you ask for more public input than let these people sign a petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| That's when you really get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| You can find out whether the people in Knox County really want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| Let them sign the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| I think that that's the way it should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| All these others have been put on that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| And in that way, you know what the public wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Now, I go into the voting booth a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| And I'm sure everybody here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Everybody is probably a lot higher educated than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| And you read these amendments, and some of them are long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| I cannot interpret what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Some of them are so long, they're going to be 300 words, they said, or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| Some of them, people don't even bother to vote for them because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| So I think that we should go and you should explain to these people and go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| and start the petitions, and that's the way it should be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I don't think we should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| And you can say we're not getting pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I'm getting pressure right now from these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| I don't know whether you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| But it seems like everybody here thinks we're getting pressure because they're talking against some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| But let them go to the public and get the petition signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| And then that way you know whether or not the people want them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| Well, and, Commissioner, the reason that we came, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| the reason that we came before county commission is because you have the ability with your vote to put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| on the ballot individually so that the public can vote for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| We don't feel like that it's possible, it's really feasible to circulate nine separate petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| and to turn in 360,000 signatures to the election commission and ask that they verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5870)|
| 1:37:58| So if we go forward, we would go forward with some of these items grouped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| And we frankly don't think that that's the best thing for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| We'd like for them to be able to vote on them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| Well, Miss Hamilton, if you came to me with nine petitions here and asked me to sign them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| I would sign the ones that I was for and then the others I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| So I don't see any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| You could still get those put on one by one if you give them to them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| When you ask somebody to sign, you can say, are you for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| They sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| Are you for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| No, I'm not for that one right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| You have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| You're raising the money from about 16 people here to fund this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| Let's spend it and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| You said you were going to have the professionals do the recall, I mean do the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Let the people get the people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Ask them if they're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Well, I think the other thing that we do if we attempt to go that route is we put a great burden on the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| commission to verify all those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| And respectfully, I think there is, I think it is difficult to go to someone with nine separate petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5940)|
| 1:39:10| I think that's very time-consuming and very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| And that's the reason that we've said that we feel like if we go, we have to group them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| The burden was put on them in the term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| It was put on them on the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Yes, sir, but that was only one petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| That's what we pay these people for down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| And that was also with the 15 percent of the people in the last election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| and not the 15 percent of all registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| So you were looking at a much different number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| To directly answer that question, the last petition drive that the election commission had to approve was one petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| approximately the same number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| It cost the election commission $35,000 to count those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| They had to hire outside help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| So we're talking about a great financial burden on the election commission that I think that we could avoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| while also the added benefit of putting them on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| If the election commission had to count nine petitions, signatures on nine petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| that's somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| We just respectfully would ask that we could avoid that cost by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| But if we spend $300,000, we know whether or not the people of Knox County want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| So they're the ones that are willing to spend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Sure, and I think another way to find out if the citizens would want those would just be to put them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| and let them vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| They'll vote no if they disagree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| Like I said, Gary, the way these things are worded in 300 words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| people aren't going to stay in there and read all nine of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| They're either not going to vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| They're going to get mixed up like a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| They say, I've heard a lot of people, and I'm sure every commissioner here has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| Well, I voted yes, but I thought I was voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Or I voted against it and thought I was voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| So let's get it out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| You could not ask for more input if the people signed the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| In the booklet that we were handed out from the Baker Center results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| and I find this kind of interesting, it says in the last paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| notable counties also utilize their own cable TV channels, streaming video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| and meetings on demand to keep citizens engaged and informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| And there were several citizens and constituents who tried to get last night's forum streamlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and there was not a cooperative movement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| And I think that all future forums, and as you know today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| I made the motion that either we adjourn or we get it on cable television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| And luckily, we did get this on cable television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| But I believe that all the forums need to be, we need to have streaming video of all these meetings on demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6112)|
| 1:42:00| to keep the citizens engaged, and I would like to see that happen if we're all going to be truly transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| I said earlier, and I just want to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I'm going to treat these like any other piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| I'm going to offer amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| I'm going to carefully consider the amendments that my colleagues offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| And I'm going to vote for some of these, and I'm going to vote not to put some of these on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| Now, I know that there's been some pressure from your organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| basically people saying, oh, if you don't vote to put this on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| we're going to make you look bad in the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Well, people can say a lot of things about me, but they'll never be able to say that I don't do my job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| and I'm going to do my job, and I'm going to legislate these as well as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| Another point I wanted to remind you of is I do want those basically a statement from your steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6174)|
| 1:43:04| particularly your top folks saying that you all will not be seeking employment with Knox County for a five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| Now, that's appointed employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| That's the appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| If someone wants to run for office, unlike your petition group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| I don't want to deny anyone the opportunity to seek elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| But I would like for you to get those signed, the ones that are willing to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| The ones that are not willing to sign it, I'd like that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| If you'll distribute it to Jolie, she'll get that out to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| I'll take care of that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Also, the other thing that I would say is I want to ask Commission to please be sensitive to those people in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| who want to weigh in on this topic and who aren't as likely as I am to stand before you and talk about these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6225)|
| 1:43:54| That's what I was referring to when I talked about that it was a different environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| when we were collecting those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| There are a lot of people that will come out when a process is set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| and they are just asked to contribute and state what their ideas are with no anticipation of having to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| and defend those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| And that was the environment that we set up when we collected the input from the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| A lot of those people, hopefully, if they are not comfortable talking in a forum like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| or debating the ideas, hopefully they will contact you as their commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| That's certainly what I'll encourage them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Hopefully they will attend some of those public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| But, again, I think you're going to have a lot of people that are attending public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| If you have a microphone for them to come up and speak, they probably won't because they're just not comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| I mean, this can be perceived as not that welcoming an environment if you're not used to standing before a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| and speaking in public and debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| So I just ask that you all keep that in mind and be sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| And my encouragement to those folks is to call your commissioners and let your thoughts be known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| and let your ideas, and I hope that will happen during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Are we at the point you can ask specific questions now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| Certainly, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Well, the one that I want to ask you about, which I sort of have a vested interest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| and I want to be as unbiased as I can about it because I guess I've looked at it a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| and would have reason to than the other commissioners, which is the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| And as you noted last night that the property assessor by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| and any other means, even the election year, is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| The clerks file, the county clerk clerks file in with the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| This is not a fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| It did raise $363 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| And I stated before and I'll stand behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| I think that there should be a firewall between them and any other political or other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| And then I want to tell you how I think that maybe you have not foreseen a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| The inspector general here tracks money, money that's received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| What you have here is a specially trained group with a lot of experiences that does appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| And he is not going to track money in that specific situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| And really, here again, and you know, 60, well, we can argue a little bit about the percentage that goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6383)|
| 1:46:31| But then you follow that money over to the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| which then we're talking about $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| And then I think they have $100 million in investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| Now, a potential conflict that I see already is that, well, I guess I'm talking about two different things, the fee office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| and the property assessor, but let me digest back to the property assessor in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| The property assessor's office is also invest money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| And I think you already have a conflict, and we have a great benefactor in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| but I'm not going to mention the name right now, has contributed $5,000 to your group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| in which the trustees has invested $10 million into a, well, into his bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6427)|
| 1:47:18| If you have a mayor, I mean, wants to keep that from growing from $10 million to $20 million to $30 million to $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| I think you have a built-in conflict really right there just with this one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| And we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| And let me say two things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| I mean, I'm not sure if this is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| When I left county government, we had an investment committee that was made up of the trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| and the county finance director, the commissioner, the chair of the finance committee on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| and one other commissioner that was appointed by commission and the, at that point in time, the county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6475)|
| 1:48:02| So that group would over, if it's still in place, I think it's still in place, would oversee those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| But the other thing I wanted to say is the inspector general's position would not just be a position that would track money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| It would be a position that is to be responsible for making sure that all branches of Knox County government were running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6496)|
| 1:48:24| as they should, be in compliance with all rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| And so that would be part of the charge that they would have there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| But let me say that a part of the ordinance that poses do you want to elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6514)|
| 1:48:45| or do you want to appoint these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| I'd like to just point out, I don't want to read it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| but I'd like to just point out in the summary of the Baker Center report that you have in your notebooks where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6531)|
| 1:49:00| It's on page 60 of the Baker Center report in response to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| why do some counties reduce the number of independent elected offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| and create appointed positions to enhance accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| That's really, I think, the segment of the Baker Center report that the group laid next to the comments that we had from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| that made those same suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| And that's the reason that you do have that ordinance there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| Well, and as a property assessor and for adjusting and appraising property many different types of it for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| there's not an exact science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| And if you have an appraisal that falls in between 150,000 and 200,000, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| that could always be a temptation there that I think should not be left with the mayor or any other office that anybody could influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6583)|
| 1:49:51| that office because that's a great deal of money that we raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| That is not an exact science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| It's not like doing that you can do your own surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| You know, you hear that when you do polls, you know, I mean, my poll was that I only had seven percent of the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6601)|
| 1:50:11| but that didn't turn out to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| And when you do surveys and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| but you certainly recognize as by being a by the job that you had that they are not a specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6615)|
| 1:50:25| Like you take in $10, you account for $10, that they cannot be appraisals are not all scientific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| Because I can tell you this indifference, say, of appraisals of cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| if you use SimSol as your software or if you use Xactimate, they will not come up with the same numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6638)|
| 1:50:46| And I'm just saying I really feel like there's a temptation that should be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| regardless of which direction that we go from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I'm sorry to say that I do have a vested interest in it since I'm on the ballot, but I wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6654)|
| 1:51:03| I want to hear from my law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| At the risk of beating a horse and probably falling into the category of the women always want the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6668)|
| 1:51:18| I really wanted to look back at this question of the timing of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| I know what Mr. McAdams has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| but I thought it would be instructive to look at the charter enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| Now, this is Tennessee law that allows a county like Knox County to be a charter county to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6694)|
| 1:51:43| And the charter enabling legislation at 5-1-210 says that among the things the charter provides for is the method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6703)|
| 1:51:57| and procedure by which such charter may subsequently be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| Now, it is for that reason that I hold the view that with respect to the amendment of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6725)|
| 1:52:14| Section 8.05 controls and controls the timing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| And when 8.05E says state or county election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| then charter amendments can be placed before the voters at state or county elections by any one of the three methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6747)|
| 1:52:39| which is charter review committee, county commission, or voter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| And I map that back to the Tennessee law governing the creation of a charter to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6765)|
| 1:52:54| The charter provides for the method and procedure by which it may subsequently be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6774)|
| 1:53:05| Commissioner Strickland, could I just say one thing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| Obviously, we've got a little debate among the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| What we would like to do maybe is get Mr. McAdams with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| and resolve this before a potential second reading on March 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| Obviously, it is to everybody's best interest if these can be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| We've been advised that by petition we cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| If there's any question at all that would be open, we would have to go forward with petitions starting on March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| Now, I want to make clear what Kathy Hampton said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| because I do think we have actually talked about this in the coordinating committee before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| We would love for these matters to be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| So if there's any way for them to be on the November ballot, either by petition or by commission putting them on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| that is preferable to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| It gives time for more public meetings, which is our desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| We would be holding these public meetings whether or not commission had said hold one in nine districts or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| We hope to hold 20 or 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| And we'd love to see debates on both sides of the issue and people very well informed so that they go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| they vote for them, they vote for them, they vote against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| Our job was to get them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| We want to let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| That is the solemn obligation we felt like we needed to follow through with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| So I want to make clear that if there is unanimity between the attorneys that these can be on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| we will delay the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| If there is not unanimity among the attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| we will have to go forward with the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| But if you decide to put matters on the November ballot, we don't have to turn the petitions in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| Does everybody understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| So if, in fact, you put all the items on in whatever form you want to put them on in the November ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6894)|
| 1:55:02| and it is consistent with the spirit of the amendments, I think that we would respond very favorably to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| Now, with that said, what I would again ask you to do is those items on which you had almost virtual unanimous agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6910)|
| 1:55:18| I think there were about four that you had almost unanimous agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| go ahead and vote on those on second reading on March 24th so we can dispose of those on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6922)|
| 1:55:30| And then the only ones in question are the five remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| And, frankly, the consistency amendment is not a policy-changing amendment anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| We may dispose of that one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| So we may just have four big issues remaining as to whether or not they would be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| I was just going to recognize the law director, but since you've done that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6953)|
| 1:56:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| Since Commissioner Bowler kind of opened up the more detailed questions, I have one for Ms. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| And that's dealing with, again, with 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| You said earlier that you all put the unification of the school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| and the county commission districts on this particular ordinance or amendment based on input that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=6989)|
| 1:56:43| And I'm not trying to pick at anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| but as I look through all of the items that you have in your five public meetings that you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7006)|
| 1:56:54| I didn't see that called out in any particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| And I definitely didn't see it called out as any one of the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| It didn't make the top three, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| And as I was going back through those, I read and because I was at the meeting, I knew, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| and several of us that were at the meetings, we understood the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| As I read it, where it was listed, it was a little bit confusing and hard to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| And I can't put my finger on that right now, but I will get you the comment that it was related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| I think, unfortunately, if you just read the comment and you weren't there to hear the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| you might not take it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| But there were some comments that that was directed to, and I'll get those and get that back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| I just failed to write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Yeah, because, again, as I said, as I went through, I didn't see that comment pulled out in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| But then, you know, but the other thing is, okay, there was a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| There was also a comment that said, eliminate appointed positions, which goes in direct, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| 180 degrees out on what the actual amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| So even if there was a comment on that, it doesn't sound like there was this groundswell that led to a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7081)|
| 1:58:09| you all actually putting, aligning those school board districts with the county commission districts on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7089)|
| 1:58:18| I would say, you know, as you all go back and kind of deliberate, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| is that really something that we're wanting to put out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| Was that coming from this public process, more so from the bakery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| And either way you all decide, I guess it's up for us to vet or not, you know, with your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| But I just ask you all to kind of consider that at this particular time, creating nine school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7116)|
| 1:58:44| and aligning them, as Commissioner Briggs said, might put some districts with two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| And does that really make sense to some with three and others with 11 or 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| Mr. Tullock, according to my records, there's only three that passed unanimous instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| They were one, three, and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Yes, I had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| I went to the restroom and I come back in and I heard you talking about the inspector generals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| Why is the salary in this and then nothing else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| Well, the salary was in this because it was a completely new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| and there really wasn't any reference for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| The salaries for the existing, the other existing officers' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| there are offices out there right now and there are salaries that are tied to those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| And I would think that that would be something that the Human Resource Department would take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| if those, if that should pass and they should become appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| So I think this was an attempt to kind of put some guidance out there where there was none by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Well, we do have guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| We have an internal audit which does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| We're going to be doing the same thing as this inspector general, no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| The only thing about the internal audit is he answers to all 19 commissioners here plus the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7207)|
| 2:00:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| In this appointment process, the qualification is going to be set by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| Now, you know where cronyism comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| You know what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| And I've never seen this commission vote down anything yet where the appointment come up recommended by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| Well, and, Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| You're starting this salary out at $144,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| Our internal audits department, the personnel in all of them, only make $156,000 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7239)|
| 2:00:46| We're going to have to furnish this person more personnel, more space, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| And we're probably talking about creating a bureaucracy here that's probably going to run us up to a quarter of a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Or none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Yes, it will be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| You know how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| But then what if we run into problems like we have right now in our government, out of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7264)|
| 2:01:14| and this guy is their appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| Well, this guy is not their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| This guy is an appointment of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| And the mayor is not to set his qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| He is to send out a request for qualifications by which interested parties would send in their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| their experience, their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| And that would then be submitted to the ethics committee who would be doing the interview to make a recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| the commission that the final appointment would be the commission's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| We vote on these appointments all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| But here's what I'm worried about, Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| When this guy is responsible for one man, he's going to pick the guy on the qualifications and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| and we vote on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| If he does something wrong, this is the man that he's appointed to this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| His livelihood goes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Now, wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| The odds are when they have to report to the commissioners here, they may be 18 of us dishonest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| but there may be one honest person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| Well, you can put pressure on this guy to make him do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| Now, I have been digging into all these allegations and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| and you can take my word when I go to an appointed office up there and ask for things, I'm stonewalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| I go to the internal auditor here, they get me anything I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| I am against this being an appointed position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| If we're going to have this, let's make it elected position then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| If it's going to be on there, I am strictly against anybody having control of somebody that's supposed to audit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| Well, and, Commissioner, I completely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| I am against anybody having control of anybody that's going to audit anyone in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| This is not an appointment by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| The mayor has no appointment process in this inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| The only thing that they do is publicize and say that they're going to take requests for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| The mayor does not, under the inspector general appointment, even recommend to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| The interviews and the entire process is run through the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| and any recommendation to the commission comes from the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| It's the commission's job to appoint in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| Who appoints the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| The ethics committee is appointed, it's my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| by the mayor and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| There are county commissioners that serve on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| So the clearinghouse, partially, then the mayor would have some indirect, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| within the process of that selection because he appoints members to the ethics committee who then is going to then pass on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| their recommendations on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Well, I would hope that our ethics committee is not unethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| I mean, that's the only thing that I can say in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| We thought, as a citizen's group, that the ethics committee was the right body to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| and that it was a body that was made up of people from all different areas of government because of the way it was composed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7455)|
| 2:04:24| At the meeting last month, your group stated the reason why they had the ethics committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| so that the mayor would have an input into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Well, that's what I just said, Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| The ethics committee is made up from people that come from both the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| and the legislative side of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| and we thought that was a way to get everybody into the interview process and then the appointment is by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7483)|
| 2:04:51| And as far as that goes, the commissioners on that body don't have to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7491)|
| 2:05:00| you don't have to take their recommendation for appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| There are commissioners that sit on that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Whoever expresses an interest in that position, any commissioner on the ethics commission could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| I want this other candidate to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| And the appointment process here is the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| I do want to stress that because the appointment clearly is the commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| Kathy, I believe, going back to me, I don't remember exactly the make-up of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| but I believe the mayor has one more person on there than the county commission was allowed to pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| one agreeable between one officeholder that both of us had to vote on, but I may be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| But on this ethics committee, I hope they're ethical, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| But I've tried and tried to get us to send a letter to the DA down there to try to prosecute some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| taking our money illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| I don't think it's ever got there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I saw some things here back in July where there were some complaints come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| and we met in the small assembly room over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| and the mayor was addressing the complaints before I knew about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| Then he got up and addressed them, and then he passed them out to the commissioners that people had wrote in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| So, you know, we've got to have checks and balances, and I don't see it on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| I don't agree why this should be an elected position or it should be just like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| Personally, I prefer it like it is right now because it's saving the county a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| and he's doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| We have an auditor over here, a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| You're a CPA, and you know that's going to be one of the qualifications for this inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| I just don't understand why we're starting him out so much money when we've got somebody that's already doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| same thing for $86,000 and hiring a guy at $144,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| Well, the comments, and again, the comments, the reason it became an issue is because we did receive some comments about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| strengthening the auditing process, and that was the intent to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| and also to have someone that had a six-year term so that the term of the appointment would last past the term of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7620)|
| 2:07:10| individuals that appointed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Well, it seems to me like instead of strengthening it, we're weakening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| That's just my belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7636)|
| 2:07:16| We're weakening that position by doing what you're asking us to do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| that we're weakening that to where it could be, you know, stonewall to us if I ask for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7640)|
| 2:07:30| Kathy, I'd like to make a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| I used to be with TVA and worked under George Prosser, who was our inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| and I thought that office did some phenomenal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| But the one, there was one conflict that came up, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| obviously you try to legislate to keep from the worst-case scenario, and you all brought that up several different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7670)|
| 2:07:59| I, too, believe Richard does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| In the short time that I've been able to work with him, I feel like he does an unbelievable job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| But the one thing that I struggle with, and I asked some folks last night from Muriel's group about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7688)|
| 2:08:16| is who does this person actually report to, male or female?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| Who do they report to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Because the one thing I learned in corporate management was that whoever writes your review is your boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| And even George Prosser, when he was at TVA, reported to Director Johnny Hayes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7709)|
| 2:08:35| even though he was charged with watching and keeping account of everything that Johnny Hayes did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| ultimately in the back of his mind, that was still his boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| And I think that really caused some huge conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| And after Director Hayes left, it caused a huge conflict for George Prosser, as was reported in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7730)|
| 2:09:00| And I guess that's one of my concerns with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| The other is that my understanding is that our ethics committee, those folks are appointed every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7745)|
| 2:09:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| So the makeup of that could change six different times while this person is serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| So, again, you know, if you're looking for stability, and I think another danger of this position, if we're not careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7765)|
| 2:09:36| is that folks are going to believe that because we have an inspector general that all is well, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7776)|
| 2:09:44| we don't have to worry anymore that there's someone watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| And, you know, I just think that's a real horrible false sense of security that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| there's someone there that's watching out for our benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| And, again, that person has to report to a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| You know, it's real hard for someone to report to a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| Now, Richard, in a sense, does, but Richard reports to every single one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| And to be honest with you, I don't know who writes his review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| I think it's advisable for every employee to always have a review from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| Now, I don't think 19 of us are going to write a review on this, quote, unquote, inspector general position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7824)|
| 2:10:32| But I think for a person to know what's expected of them, how to operate, and not have 19 different opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7832)|
| 2:10:41| I think you've got to have one person that is ultimately responsible for that employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| Well, I think that, as I've said, the way this is written, it would be an appointment of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| Therefore, the commission could remove this person for cause, but otherwise it's a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| You're appointing the person for a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| So, I mean, in my mind, the person that appoints is the person that is responsible for that particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7860)|
| 2:11:10| But do you understand how convoluted that could get to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| I mean, when, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| And, again, I'm saying commission appoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| The difference right now between this and the internal audit position is that this position would be appointed for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7878)|
| 2:11:26| six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| That would be written into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| There would be a six-year term unless there was basically cause to bring the person up for dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7891)|
| 2:11:40| The intent was to give, put the person in a position where they feel like they have the absolute freedom to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| anywhere in county government and ask any question of county government, maybe even the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| without any fear of retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| And that's the background and the evolution of the recommendation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| I would like to correct something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| Richard only makes $84,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| So we're talking about a $60,000 raise for this gentleman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| And, Kathy, this guy has free reign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| And the reason why he has free reign to go anywhere, the commission office, which he's audited us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| and everything, which, you know, we don't have an expense account, none of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| But the reason why he has free reign, it takes two-thirds of the commission to fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| So that gives him a safeguard where he can go in and attack you, me, or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| And we have to keep these things in the people's hands where he has to be reported to every one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| where we can have some input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Yes, I was going to add a little bit about on the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| The two experiences I've had with it is in the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| and also after pretty extensive discussions with some of the leaders over at TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| And one of the weaknesses over at TVA is that the inspector general does not report to the CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| He reports to Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| And he's really the eyes and ears for Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| And really what I wanted to point out also is what Commissioner Daniels said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| is that I really think he has to have a boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| He has to have a person he reports back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| I think it naturally would be the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| The other comment, and I think that's a weakness if he doesn't have a boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| The other comment that I would like to make is that the inspector general really does a lot more than just an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| He can go in, and I'm not going to pick on any office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| I should flip a coin because someone thinks I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| Let's say he goes into the property assessor's office and thinks that there's too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8019)|
| 2:13:46| I'll pick that one because Phil was down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| But he can go into that office and say he's got too many personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| He needs to modernize the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| We need to bring technology into it because we can do it more efficiently and make more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| And then he could come back to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| and maybe under our system we don't have any other power other than the power of the purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| But if we cut them 20 percent, then they're pretty much forced to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| And it's the same way he would have the opportunity to go into an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| and to be certain that contracts are being done the way they're supposed to, that other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| where there's maybe federal government regulations looking at it, he could do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| I know recently we had potentially $840,000 of government, federal government money at Jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| because we weren't following the right procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| That's all I'm going to make on that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| A couple of the other specifics that I was wondering about is I'm going to have to get back on track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8078)|
| 2:14:46| Mr. Briggs, let me say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Let's go into these offices and tell them if they're overstaffed and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8089)|
| 2:14:56| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| The other thing that we, I was wondering about on these amendments is that some of these were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8099)|
| 2:15:07| and looked at before we had an ethics committee, such as the nepotism, the ones on conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8107)|
| 2:15:17| And are these amendments, and I'm asking this as a question because I don't, I'm not recommending anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| are these amendments still necessary or do the, or is the ethics committee have enough power to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8122)|
| 2:15:31| that we're doing these things already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| In other words, are these amendments still necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| Well, I think the reason that they were brought forward is because the people felt like that it really was holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8137)|
| 2:15:45| Knox County government up as an example to have this type of a policy and a practice as a part of its charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8145)|
| 2:15:53| And not just as a policy within government that could be altered or changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| Because once it is in the charter, then it has to be changed by a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| And I think they felt like that was just a good example to have out there and to state that as part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8164)|
| 2:16:11| And really my last question had to do, again, with 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| This is restructuring the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| If I look over here, and it really, this is almost an administrative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| This is, it says, this is in part E of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| It says section 4.01, property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| And when I look back on the county charter, this has something to do with the judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| What am I seeing wrong with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8196)|
| 2:16:46| If you go to the county charter and you go to section 4.03, and according to the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8206)|
| 2:16:54| it has to do with register of the deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| But when I look at section 4.03, it's abolishing divisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| or alternating compensation under the judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| And Commissioner Luthold, or former Commissioner Luthold, I should say, just supplied the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| Thank you very much, Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| He said he thinks that what's causing this is the charter has been renumbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| so we're looking at two different sets of numbering systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| The one I have was the one that was provided us by the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| And I think you probably, I mean, I would guess that you've got the current numbering and maybe there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| I'm not sure I know which numbering is which, but I think that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| And I'll check and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| Well, if you're reading from the ordinances, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| the ordinances were supplied by the law director with the correct numbering is our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8260)|
| 2:17:47| And our petitions now are conforming to the numbering in the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| So the ordinances should be the correct numbering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Commissioner Freese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| Just a few moments ago, maybe it was 20, 30, 45 minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| Lawrence made reference that we go ahead and those that were unanimous in the first reading to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8287)|
| 2:18:15| and pass them on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| But I would like to challenge you to listen to your people in your forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| and take surveys and listen to your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| And your vote may not necessarily be the same on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| I'm not saying that it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| I'm saying that please listen and take into account because last night was very informative for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| hearing from the people from District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| And it has given me a lot more to chew on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| And I challenge you all to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Commissioner DeFries, the reason that I ask that, I just want to make sure that you understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| is right now we've got a number of petitions before the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| We've got the two big bundled petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| If, in fact, you don't take any action on the second reading at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| and we can't delay past March 25th, we've got to go forward with the two big bundled petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8339)|
| 2:19:06| Then let's assume that you put seven of the nine on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| Let's make that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| We don't have any ability to amend those big bundled petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| So if another alternative we've got is let's just, if you'll go to the last section in your notebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8361)|
| 2:19:28| let me just walk you down those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| Ordinance 101, I don't know if it was unanimous or not, but it was a pretty overwhelming vote on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8374)|
| 2:19:42| There doesn't seem to be a, it's simple, it's straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| It's stating the existing charter language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| I think even Commissioner Lambert spoke in favor of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| Even Commissioner Lambert spoke in favor of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| So there doesn't seem to be a lot of controversy about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| If we can dispose of that one, it comes off the bundled petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| Number two, I think, is one that has great controversy associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| And we wouldn't expect that you would be ready to vote on second reading on that on March 24th because of that controversy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8411)|
| 2:20:18| if you follow through what I'm hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| Number three, I think, passed may not have been unanimous, but pretty overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Let's dispose of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Number four has great controversy associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| Number five, restrictions on nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| I think passed, maybe not unanimously, but pretty positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| Let's dispose of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Number six, county commissioners cannot be employed by other branches of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| You all make a decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| That may be one you want to dispose of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| It may be one that you want to go forward with and work on some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| And then finally, number seven, conflicts of interest on a voted matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| I think that one was a pretty big majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| Let's dispose of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| If we could get rid of those four, then we will, on March 25th, if we have to go forward with a petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8473)|
| 2:21:22| go forward with four questions on two separate petitions or four issues on two separate petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8482)|
| 2:21:31| And it makes it much clearer for the voter if you never do anything on those whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8491)|
| 2:21:38| But if, on the other hand, you come back and put all four of those questions on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8498)|
| 2:21:44| we then never turn in that petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| So that's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| You've got total authority to do what you want to do, but that would be our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| But if this is truly to be a citizen-directed initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| then the public must be afforded the opportunity to develop specific ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| And I know I just don't want the county commissioners to be put under any pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| just because of your time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| And I want to make it clear you've got the authority to do anything you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| And that would be a valid reason to delay forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| But understand that we also have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| That's not my intent, but I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Well, Lauren, some of these were voted unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Some of these people voted just to have this discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| If we vote these in now, I believe Commissioner Daniel said he just voted for all of them to put them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8552)|
| 2:22:40| so we could discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| If we have this second reading, we don't know what the public out here thinks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| And they're already on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| We may, if we vote on the second reading to put these things on here, where, like Mr. Daniels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| I don't know how many other commissioners here voted just to get the discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| We don't have public input on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| And when you go to your forum, you may find out some of these people are against the things that you put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| I think we need to go along with Mr. Freeze here and delay this till we hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| Commissioner Pinkston, in all respect, if you don't understand after February 5th that the public is speaking out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8588)|
| 2:23:16| nepotism and conflicts of interest, I don't know when you'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| Well, are those the only two you want us to put on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| I asked for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| What were the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| I think I just went through them, but you want me to do it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| Yes, I want you to clarify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Number one, 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| Let me just put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| I'll go for the two that you just talked about if you want to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| Number three, ordinance 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| Number five, ordinance 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| Number seven, ordinance 109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| I'm still going to stick with what I say after looking at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| that we need to get the public input before we have second reading on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| You keep telling me you want public input, but then now we're wanting to do it, have public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| You want us to go ahead and put these on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| I just want to say again, the public puts a lot of their input through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| We're their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| The legislative process, I think, needs to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| I'm not going to rubber stamp anything simply because it passed last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| Again, these are not carved in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| Moses didn't bring them down from the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| And I think they are to be debated, amended, and legislated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| We're legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| And I want everyone here, I want to encourage all of my colleagues, look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| The ones you can support, be ready to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| The ones that you think need some tweaking, bring some amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| because you're going to come up with amendments that I'm not thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| You may be able to fix one of these I voted against and cause me to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| I'm going to do exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| Each one of these, I will probably have some amendments to it, except the first one, which I am, which was very simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8713)|
| 2:25:21| and I'm very strongly in support of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| And we need to do our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| Our job is to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| And part of the citizen input is through us because we are representing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| each representing our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| And none of these things need to go on carved in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| As far as I'm concerned, there were the two clay tablets brought down in the Old Testament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| and I've got my suspicions that John Browning may have received the plans for the 1911 government model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8746)|
| 2:25:53| on similar clay tablets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| Other than that, everything else is to be debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| Mr. Strickland, if you would allow me to just take care of a real quick housekeeping matter on my part and turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8759)|
| 2:26:06| I think when I came up this morning, I did not read my address into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| So just so you have it for the record, I live at 1528 Boxford Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| Now we've all identified ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| And that said, I'm going to apologize to you because I am going to have to excuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| I can't stay any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| And I'm going to ask that Brad Hill and Lawrence Tullock come up and share the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| and address any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| And I just want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| And, again, to thank Commissioner DeFreeze for arranging the --and Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8798)|
| 2:26:44| for arranging the forum last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| And we look forward to participating in more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| I didn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| We didn't break the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Mr. Tullock, I just really would like for you to clarify something for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| You had stated that if we go ahead and pass four of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| then you could move forward with the other ones on petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| So I guess what I'm confused about is that we're going to have public forums and we're going to get input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| but despite that input, you're still going to put forth petitions, irregardless of what that input is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8839)|
| 2:27:26| And that's where I'm a little bit puzzled as to what you're even asking of us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8846)|
| 2:27:33| Because it seems like that you're continuing to state that irregardless of what we do as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| you're moving forward with these petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| And what we talk about, discuss, and what we hear from the citizens is not important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| and doesn't matter and will not change your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| And that, to me, really concerns me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| The one place where I really agree with Commissioner Pinkston is that the ultimate test of the strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8874)|
| 2:28:02| of these ideas is the people voting on them in various ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8882)|
| 2:28:08| And one of the ways that they will vote on them will be whether or not they want them on the ballot through a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8888)|
| 2:28:15| And so through the petition drive, we would be doing public forums even if you weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| We would be doing public forums all over the place because we see our job as educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8902)|
| 2:28:29| The one place that I continue to want to make sure you understand is we don't have any flexibility in the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8909)|
| 2:28:37| Not one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| And so what you'd be asking us to do, and, again, put yourself in our shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| what you'd be asking us to do would be to say, trust us that we will do something about these in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| Do away with any option you have of going forward with getting these on the ballot this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| I'm not arguing the time frame, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| What I'm arguing is the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| You're not willing to, you have told us that we can do whatever we want with the content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| but you are still going to continue to put the same content on your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| And we have all had questions and concerns about some of the legalities of these, some of the actual logistics of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| how these are going to operate and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| And there's not been any flexibility with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| And that's what I'm concerned about, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| I'm not arguing the fact of whether or not people should vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| I think that that is an aside issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| That's a completely different issue than what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| We need to be talking about the content of the amendments because they drastically change our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| And if people in these forums state that they're not interested in voting, they want to remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8982)|
| 2:29:50| they want to vote on their Register of Deeds, that they want to vote on these clerks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| you're still stating that you're going to put the petition on and have on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| No, I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| I'm saying we're going forward with a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| Let me answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| Our only option, our only two options in that drive are to finish it and turn it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| and get the matters on the ballot or not finish it and not turn in the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| And you have put the matters on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| The second part of that is, the second part of that is, if we knew right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| by March 25th, the content changes, you're asking a very, very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9030)|
| 2:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| If we knew right now by March 25th the content changes that was a consensus of this commission on the four items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9038)|
| 2:30:49| that are controversial and we agreed to those content changes because it didn't change the spirit of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9049)|
| 2:30:57| particular amendments, we would, in fact, change the content before the petition drive starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9057)|
| 2:31:05| But I don't think there's any way that anybody will know the content changes you might contemplate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| through amendments by March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| And so our only option in that case, because of the time frames, is to go forward with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| If you then amend on those four controversial items and put them on the November ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| if you amend the content in a way that sticks with the spirit of those items, we just don't turn in the petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9089)|
| 2:31:38| and they go on the November ballot by commission rather than the August ballot by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| But my real question, sir, is, is if there is a major voice in this community that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9104)|
| 2:31:50| we want to vote for these offices, will you still put that on the petition or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| I would say if there is a major voice that doesn't even want it on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| we won't be successful on the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| But that means you're still going to do the petition with that on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| At this point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| At this point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| Yeah, they're doing the petition drive, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| Again, again, I would ask you to put yourself in our shoes until we know what changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| I understand what you're saying is that you're kind of hamstrung in certain regards, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| But what comes across to us, sir, is that you're still going to do your petition the way you want to do your petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9146)|
| 2:32:34| irregardless of public input, citizen input, this commission's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9154)|
| 2:32:39| You've decided this is our language, this is what we like, these are the issues that we think are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9159)|
| 2:32:44| and we're doing it gung-ho and the rest of us be damned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| No, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| It appears that way, sir, and it sounds that way, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| Because we have been here since, what, eight o'clock this morning for four and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| We discussed it for two hours last night at our, how long, eight hours that we discussed this at our first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9177)|
| 2:33:07| And the same answer that we keep getting is we're going forward with the petition, we're going forward with the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| we're going forward with the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| Well, let me use a specific example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| Let's take the partisan versus nonpartisan election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| But why does it have to happen right now this August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Why can we not create a group, a study group or a committee group, and really discuss these issues and go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9203)|
| 2:33:30| gather more public input, because we have had changes in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| We will have changes come August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Because there are eight of us here and certain, probably five of us will not be sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9217)|
| 2:33:44| And so we're going to give someone the product that I'm not really sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| And I want to make sure that whatever I, that my successor inherits is something that is a quality product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9230)|
| 2:33:59| and is something that I believe in, that I put my name to, that I have really researched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| and investigated and have heard from the community and that I feel justified in the legalities of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| And there have been more and more questions about some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| And when you have somebody that says that they haven't really looked at the logistics of the school districting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9254)|
| 2:34:19| that's a real concern, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9259)|
| 2:34:20| We haven't had the school board come down to us and talk to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| Maybe individually we have talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| But we need to have this very serious conversation about what we're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9267)|
| 2:34:35| and slow this process down to make sure that it's done right and that it's done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9275)|
| 2:34:43| I think we today indicated the flexibility that we feel comfortable stating today that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9283)|
| 2:34:53| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| We understand completely what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| We want that public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| We also feel an absolute obligation to a process that started last year that said we would take those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9299)|
| 2:35:07| that came out of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| But we've made a lot of changes since last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| We have just what you said with regard to the February election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| A lot of things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| This commission body has responded in a lot of ways to the changes and to the voice of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9318)|
| 2:35:25| And I think that we need to really recognize that and incorporate that into some of what's going on currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9325)|
| 2:35:33| And not just base everything on a year ago or two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| What we need to look at is right now and how things are working right now and move forward from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| Because this is a different commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| This is a different community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| And we have had a lot of people become more involved and become more aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| And maybe they would like to really voice their opinion and contribute to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| And we need to make sure that they're heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| We would be excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| We think ultimately people voice their opinion best if they're allowed to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| I think the biggest concern we've got is the potential of perpetual delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| and particularly delay after this voting season in August and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| I think you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| I understand that there's been a history of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| And that's what you're concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9385)|
| 2:36:26| But we're a different body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| And this for us, we need to be afforded the opportunity and the trust that we're not trying to play tricks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9388)|
| 2:36:38| that we're not doing delaying tactics, that we're actually reading these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| and we're really trying to vet these and really scrub them down and make sure it's a quality product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| And we need to be afforded that opportunity and the respect that we're trying to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9408)|
| 2:36:54| I certainly understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| And we've already committed numerous hours already as a whole body to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| So there has been a dedication on our behalf to listen and to wrap our brains around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| Commissioner Ballant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| This is directed towards our law director, I guess, in standing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| Is it possible for their, I guess, legislative and executive petition to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9435)|
| 2:37:24| And for us to modify one, is it possible that they both could pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| And if so, which would have standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| And then I've got another question along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| That could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| And then which would have standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I think it would end up becoming a judicial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| I can envision a situation where if a number of amendments are passed and some of them are conflicting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9471)|
| 2:38:00| then it will become a question for a court under some circumstance brought by persons with standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9480)|
| 2:38:08| who have a real case or controversy to ask the court, now, what does the charter mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9488)|
| 2:38:17| And I guess, Lauren, I don't know where you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| Is it in the legislative part, the enabling ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9504)|
| 2:38:25| What happens if that part doesn't pass and then, say, a part, well, let's say the appointments pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9505)|
| 2:38:35| And in my particular race, our terms are 2-12 and not 2-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| Would that change it up or would you have a legal question there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| I guess also along those same lines, you simultaneously voted for two people to have terms till 2-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9525)|
| 2:38:51| but at the same time you're voted, it's voted to end in 2-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9531)|
| 2:39:03| It may depend on whether it's on the ballot in August or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9543)|
| 2:39:10| Is the swearing-in, so is the election when you're elected, is that the day or is it the swearing-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080312charteramendments?start=9550)|
