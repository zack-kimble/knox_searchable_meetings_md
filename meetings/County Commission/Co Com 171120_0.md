| 0:08:10| you, Mr. Chair. A couple of months ago, I attended a Vietnam Veterans Association meeting in Pal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| came across the fact that there is a pin presentation authorized by the Congress of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| I received a pin then. I was honored to receive a pin as serving during the period of the Vietnam War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| I went to Colonel Julian and said during this month of November, it would be a nice fact if Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| County could take a moment to recognize people that might be at this meeting this evening who served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=520)|

| 0:08:54| Mayor Tim Burchett. Thank you, Commissioner Wright. If we could ask our Vietnam veterans to come on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=534)|
| 0:09:06| here. Law enforcement, you know, they just go their own way. You just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=546)|

| 0:09:37| It's Vietnam era. Vietnam era. They served active duty during the Vietnam era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Are there other prior military here in attendance tonight? I see one young lady here coming on behalf of her father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=583)|
| 0:09:54| Are there other Vietnam War era former veterans here tonight who has not received a pin? Come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=594)|
| 0:10:08| I think we're just doing it for county employees. If we bring in lawyers, we're going to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Here we're going to get the date. Right here's the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| This is for anyone who served on active duty in the U.S. military anywhere, doesn't matter where you served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| anywhere in the world, between the dates of November 1st, 1955 to May 15th of 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=626)|
| 0:10:38| Arthur, were you in that time frame? Get up there then, brother. We're going to limit it to county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=638)|
| 0:10:48| You've taken enough from the county. We're honored. This is great that we can honor you all, turn the program over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| I'd like to say as the son of a World War II veteran, my father got his welcome home multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| and unfortunately you all didn't. This is a small way to pay back you all's incredible sacrifice you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| and we're honored that you all are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=673)|

| 0:11:38| He was the Assistant Commissioner of Veterans Affairs for the State of Tennessee, and he did great work for our veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| and he is a veteran himself. Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you, and good evening. Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six. Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| I counted that. Got extras and did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Before I start the pin, this program began with the Presidential Proclamation in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| that started a 13-year commemorative period to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| In 2014, the Department of Defense, it only took them 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| the Department of Defense authorized this commemorative pin to be presented to veterans who served during the Vietnam War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| We'd like to do that presentation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I put that sign up over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Part of this presentation makes reference to the symbolism of the pin, what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| That's a picture of the pin that you will be receiving this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| so that way you'll be able to follow along and see what it is that the presentation is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| As part of the 50th commemoration of the Vietnam War, we would like to present you with this commemorative pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Its purpose is to recognize, thank, and honor United States military veterans who served during the Vietnam War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| On the pin, the eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| The eagle represents the courage, honor, and dedicated service to our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| As one of the most recognizable and notable American symbols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=792)|

| 0:19:32| On behalf of the people of Knox County, I'd just like to say welcome home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1172)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1201)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1224)|
| 0:20:34| Okay, it's time to move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| First up is Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you, Chairman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Ed Schaus, 1301 Wilshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Several of you asked me about the tax sale we had October 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and the rebid sale this past Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| I think Commissioner Wright, he attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| I think he's attended at least two of the three that we've had on my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| and I appreciate his interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| We start with hundreds of parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I've had several questions from some of you and some of the public in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| of why wasn't this piece in there or that piece in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| To start with, we're working on 22 now, number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| which will come up in about a year, and we have about 400 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| To be realistic, you need about 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| It would take two days to go and auction 400 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| So that 400 will be whittled down to 200, then hopefully 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| then 100, 190 to 100, 110, primarily because people pay them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| I mean, I'll be frank, this is one of the most more unpleasant parts of my job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| is the tax sale because we are forcibly taking people's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| because for one reason or another they can't pay their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| or won't pay their taxes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| I'll give you a quick breakdown of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| We actually had 117 parcels we started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| That's a consultation with myself and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| and Clerk and Master Howard Hogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| We combined several lots in South Knoxville near the South Dole School area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| combined some vacant lots, so we went to the auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| started with 108 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| History has proven that about 50-50 in the past tax sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| about 50 are taken by investors and speculators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and about 50 are taken by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And so the surplus ultimately, we did a little better this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| 69 were sold to investors, 34 were bought by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| and five there were no sales because Knox County did not want to bid on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| I guess the way to put it in the real estate vernacular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| it had a negative value because of EPA or runoff or, it's hard to believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| but picking up the obligation to pay a homeowner's association dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| The county is very reluctant to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| The total dollar amount that was sold at the tax sale was $1,272,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| I wish I could say that all went in the county's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| It did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| $156,000 went to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| $268,280 went to Knox County to pay taxes and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| And $847,000 will be held by the Clerk and Master to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| basically, that's the gap on when the taxes are paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| and say the taxes are $10,000 and somebody paid $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Well, that $20,000 is held in escrow by Howard Hogan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| to be ultimately distributed to the owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| They have to petition for it and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| That's a bottom line of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| I have some staff who works on this year-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| It's a fairly intricate process, and I can answer any questions if you have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| or I know you want to get your meeting done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Feel free to come by my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Several of you have in the last couple of days to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| and I'll be happy to give you any details that you might want on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| I would say this does trickle down to the bottom line of the 2008 property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| are now the collection rate for the 2008 property taxes are running at 99.91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| So you're never going to collect 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| It would be nice to say we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| We will, but realistically we will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| But we're running at 99.9-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| So that's a snapshot of what we did the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Anybody got questions, try to answer it now or come by tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Mr. Trustee, I commend you and your staff for the actions that you've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| I looked at several of the pieces of property just at the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| and there were some parcels there with property tax several years in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| I'm sorry that we, Knox County, have to go about this legal and lengthy process to collect taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| but it's what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I encourage you to continue to do that because it's money for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| It's unfortunate we have to go to that, and it is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Let me just add a little bit of editorializing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It is expensive, but the taxpayer who's not paying their taxes is going to pay 18% interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| So we do cover our expenses in that 18% interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And you know what you earn at a bank, so that's a very expensive rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| But thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Mr. Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you for the great job you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Next up is David McCorkley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| David McCorkley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| I guess he is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Commissioner Wright has some very special guests he would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Yes, I would like to call Troop 500 to the podium for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| They were asking to be on public forum for just a moment because I asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| why would scouts be here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I'd like to introduce Chris Wright and a couple of her scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| She is mentoring toward the merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| The question is, why are you here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| These fellows are working on a citizenship in the community requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| where they are to find an issue that's relevant to their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| see how their representatives handle the pros and cons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| or the negatives and the positives of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| and come to a decision as to how the county will move forward with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| So that's why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you, Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| So we see the future of America standing here before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| wanting to know what we do and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Chairman, one of them also gets a photography badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| as well, just to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| Moving on to honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1679)|

| 0:28:19| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1699)|

| 0:28:27| And I will turn it over to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| David Connor is the executive director of the Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and has served in that post since January of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| So what does the Tennessee County Services Association do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| They represent the 95 county mayors in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| They also represent the 95 county road superintendents in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| and 1,640 of our commissioner colleagues across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| And we really appreciate having him come all the way from Nashville this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| to participate in this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1750)|

| 0:29:17| You all forgot to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Would you like for the Madam Clerk to read this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| Whereas at the recent Tennessee County Services Association annual conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Dwight VandeVate, Knox County Senior Director of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| was elected to serve as president of the Tennessee County Services Association Board of Directors for 2017-2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| And whereas Mr. VandeVate has a history of service with the Tennessee County Services Association Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| including serving as second vice president as an east Tennessee highway official in 2015-2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| and serving as first vice president in 2016-2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| And whereas the Tennessee County Services Association Board of Directors is a 19-member board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| representing three affiliate associations, namely the Association of County Mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| the Tennessee County Commissioners Association, and the Tennessee County Highway Officials Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| And whereas the Tennessee County Services Association has a combined membership of more than 1,800 elected and appointed officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| of both the executive and legislative branches of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and its board is responsible for adopting a legislative platform each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| and directing association activities with the goal of improving the operation of Tennessee County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| and thereby the services counties provide to their residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| And whereas Knox County desires to recognize Dwight VandeVate upon the occasion of his election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| to serve as president of the Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| and commend him for his election by his peers to serve in such a leadership role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1849)|

| 0:31:18| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1884)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners, especially the sponsoring commissioners for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| I am hard pressed. It really does mean a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Just a couple of thoughts to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| My journey with this government started July 16th of 1984| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| and walked in the doors for the first time as a correctional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| We actually called detention officers at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| working the evening shift in the Knox County Jail with Wednesdays and Thursdays off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| And it has been a long and glorious journey, absolutely amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| and I am privileged to have been a part of so much over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| I believe so much in public service and I believe so much in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| County government is the government that is closest to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| It is the government that delivers the services that make a difference in the lives of our constituents every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| And I'm here to tell you the work that you do matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| In those 30 some odd years since 1984,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| one thing I will tell you is I've seen various iterations of the legislative body come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| And I would want to share with you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| as a guy who probably has more career behind him than he does in front of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| that this commission is as strong as it has ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| I appreciate each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| This is a legislative body that any county in the state would be envious to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| I've had good fortune in working for a mayor who has given me so many opportunities to thrive and grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| and Mayor Burchett has consistently been supportive in every endeavor that we undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=1998)|
| 0:33:27| I've had the blessing of a great staff, and certainly none of it's possible without support at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| I've got my youngest child here, so I'll take just a moment of personal privilege and introduce her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Holly Marie Mandevate, my pride and joy, actually one of three pride and joys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2020)|
| 0:33:48| I will do my best in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I am grateful to David Connor and Rodney Carmichael for their investment in me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| and for the opportunity that they've given me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| and I will do my best to bring good leadership that I learned from all of you and from the mayor and from my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2037)|
| 0:34:08| I'll do my best to bring those skills and those lessons to Tennessee County Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you very much. This really means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2053)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2067)|
| 0:34:58| Mr. Connor, you drove all the way in from Nashville, sir. Would you like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you for the gracious welcome here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| I was very much pleased to be here on this occasion recognizing Dwight for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| The position of president within our association is elected each year by the members, and I think they all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| he is a person who just epitomizes the idea of a humble public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| His dedication, I know, to his county, to his family, to the state of Tennessee, to his involvement in our association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| he really steps up and tries to reach out to continue to make our association stronger through his leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| welcoming in other people, working together with other county officials, networking with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| trying to seek to find ways to educate himself and to help his fellow county officials and county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| county mayors all become better public servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| So that's what I think his entire career exemplifies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| and we just couldn't be more pleased and honored to have him serving as our president this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| So I was happy to be here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| And obviously it's a big deal for Knox County because there's 94 other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| that don't have Dwight Vanderveet serving as the chairman this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2170)|
| 0:36:28| If I could, if there's no objection, I'd like to move an item under In Other Business up to right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| so we can go ahead and get this out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| That's a presentation to recognize Chris Gondue and Martin Pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| for establishing the Environmental Stewardship Program in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| and being recognized by the Tennessee County Service Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Would Commissioner Schoomaker, Bussler, Daly, and Carringer like to go down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2209)|
| 0:37:11| As they make their way to the podium, we have Chris Gondue and Martin Pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| This is our second big award that I know that Knox County's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| We had one last year for solar panels, I believe. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah, for energy savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Energy savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Yeah, for the procurement department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| This year we were fortunate enough to have an environmental award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| There's 95 counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| There was only three awards this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| One of the awards went to Campbell County, who took a brownfield and made it into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| The second one went to Giles County that had something to do with their jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| I'm not sure what it was, but it had to do with their jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Then Knox County was fortunate enough to have, under Dwight Vanderbeek's leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| that we have an award for environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Chris and Martin are here to tell a little bit about the award and what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2283)|
| 0:38:13| I'm Chris Gondue with Knox County Stormwater Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I'm listed only alphabetically here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I want to give my time to Martin Pleasant to tell you a little bit about the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| and I want to say thank you to all the commission for recognizing our work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2303)|
| 0:38:33| First, I want to thank commissioners for being commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| What you do is very important, and you serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| We serve the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| We hear from the public like you hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I also want to thank the Tennessee County Service Association for giving us this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| We do greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| We just do our jobs and go out and serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| We don't always think about recognition, so we do appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| I want to tell you a little bit about the program because you get calls from constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| and this program can help you guide them in ways to fix problems that we mitigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| a lot of them primarily from old development sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| When people have serious drainage issues, they call our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| which I'm sure that you hear from them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| and we come up with solutions to fix those problems for them in an environmentally friendly manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| A typical thing would be somebody has an eroded ditch line that's running across their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| and we convert that to a grass line channel, or they have an eroded stream bank on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| and we help them restore that in a natural way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| We put in rain gardens, wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| We do permeable pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| We have all these great techniques that we've found a way to do them that are more cost effective also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| but our share is that we have public roads that discharge these systems, so we have a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| It's a community issue with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| I'm just going to give you some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We also provide our expertise to help solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| For a lot of the public, it's a complicated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and they can spend thousands and thousands of dollars trying to solve these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| and then they call us, and we can provide the expertise to help them solve them in a manner that's long-lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| You probably already know this, but there's 250,000 residents that we serve, 2,000 miles of roads, 134 bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| 34,000 pieces of drainage infrastructure in the county, so we receive a lot of calls from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2442)|
| 0:40:51| Just to give you some numbers of the program, since 2001, we've had this program, but we've been kind of quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| We didn't advertise it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Since Dwight has been on board with the county, he's upped our budget for the program, and we've grown tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| We were starting out doing about three to four projects a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| We're currently doing over 20-plus a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| We've done over 200 total projects in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| We've done four bioswales, 27 rain gardens, 11 stream bank restoration projects, 165 grass swales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| five wetland projects, a living wall, and over six permeable paver projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| I encourage you to check out our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| You can find out more information about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Particularly when you get constituent calls, you can refer them to it to get a little bit of knowledge on what we can provide for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| We've also combined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| It's a cost-share program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| We pay 60% of the installed cost, and the clients pay 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| To date, we've invested with them over three-quarters of a million dollars into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| We feel it's very successful, and we appreciate your support for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| Chris has been there from the beginning, and it's very important to have this larger support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| Several people on our staff have helped with the program over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Just from people taking calls and dealing with very upset, irate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| there's a whole process just to manage people and to get them to know that there's other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| When someone's upset, they're going to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| They're going to call their state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| They're going to call every agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Then when they get to us, we have real solutions for them, and that's such a great benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| Keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Next time someone calls you about a flooding or drainage issue, we do have options for them at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| I want to take advantage of Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I want to recognize that my family's here, because this is why we do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| It's for our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| There's my lovely wife, Virginia, my two daughters, and my son, Casper, Gala, and Jada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2593)|
| 0:43:30| Again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| I know in our department that you've recognized us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| We sometimes live on an island, and we're mostly getting negative news from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| They're very upset, but we do want to help them solve these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Greatly, greatly appreciated your recognition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you all for your great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Again, I just wanted to thank the Tennessee County Services Association, who sponsors these recognition programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2635)|
| 0:44:07| It's great that Knox County, here we are, the third largest in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| We got an award last year, and we got an award this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| Obviously, we're doing the right things in Knox County, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| We appreciate David and the Tennessee County Services Association for recognizing what's going on in the different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2671)|
| 0:44:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the honor of the devotional tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| At this time, I'd like to introduce a gentleman who actually is one of my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| but he has another honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| He is involved with the Knox County Sheriff's Department Chaplain Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| and he's actually kind of the quasi-director of organizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| Before he steps to the podium, I'd like to recognize Mayor Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| who would like to say a few words about Mr. Gerald McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, Commissioner, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| I think it's very appropriate today that Pastor McGinnis is here because we're honoring some Vietnam veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| Pastor McGinnis is a very humble man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| If you read his bio on his church's web page, it just kind of glosses over his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| He is a combat veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| He's a heavily decorated bronze star with valor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| He's the real deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| My dad would say, he'd probably give you the ultimate bit of praise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| that my dad, he would have told you, you would have made a good Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Anyway, he and his wife started their church in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| I believe they started with 20 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Now they have over 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I got the pleasure of being caught in that traffic jam last Sunday, as a matter of fact, as they were coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| So it would be appropriate if he'd come to the podium now and say a prayer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| Pastor McGinnis, thank you, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| It's an honor to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I've been asked to just share a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Hello, my name is Gerald McGinnis, and to share a little bit with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Knox County Sheriff's Department has a Chaplain's Corps that was instituted in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| You have approximately 32 chaplains serving for you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| Every morning at 8 a.m., they will go to the Sears building and pick up an unmarked car, a police radio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| and they will report to dispatch that they're on duty for the next 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| You have a chaplain on 24-7, 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| They do your death notification, suicides, homicides, domestics, and mass fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| We have worked many, many cases in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and these men and women that serve you are honored to serve with you and to serve for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| I commend the commission and Sheriff J.J. Jones, our county mayor, our honorable mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| for permitting this and endorsing this and helping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| We are very honored to get to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| I'm a Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| I grew up, some of you may not know the place, it's over the hill called Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| I grew up there around Porky's Pool Room and went to the Boys Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| and when we got a little bit of money, we moved over to Lonsdale and lived in the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I graduated from Fulton High School, and I'm honored to be in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| and honored to work with men and women like you that have devoted your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| I want to pray from a Christian perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I encourage you to pray from your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Heavenly Father, I come to you tonight in the name of our Lord and Savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| I thank you for every man and woman that sit around this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| for the talent and their temperance that they give to their county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| the sacrifice they make to serve, and some of the things they go through to endure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| to be servants and to be leaders in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| I pray that you would impart unto them wisdom, knowledge, and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| as they make vital decisions that impact individuals and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| I pray, God, that this community will continue to grow as it has in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| that it will grow economically, that it will grow spiritually, and it will grow morally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| I pray for your blessings and favor, and in three days from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| we will gather around our tables with our family, our friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Some will invite in others from their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| and we will give thanks for all that you've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| I stand here today reminded of the background that most of us come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| and the humble beginning that we had to be where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| The Bible says it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| We give you praise and adoration for all that you have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| and I pray that our future will be in brighter than our past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| as we committed to you in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| Amen and amen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Commissioner Wright, will you lead us in the pledge, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| I ask that you give proper attention to our country's flag and join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| Mr. Chairman, we have another scout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| I don't know. I thought he might have been with the other group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Would you like to invite him up and introduce yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=3003)|

| 1:10:58| Also a couple of other announcements, Gibbs Christmas Parade is December 3rd, the Cornington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4258)|

| 1:11:17| It's a good season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4280)|

| 1:11:29| I was told not to say that I was Principal for a Day in Knox County because of my lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| of education, but anyway, I went anyway, and I got to go to Adrian Burnett and be the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Now, they first started off with the kindergarten, first grades, where I was reading to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| and I failed that miserably, but then they sent me in front of the student council, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| was made up of fourth and fifth grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Jasmine, Junior, Samantha, Bailey, Lucy, Madison, Aaron, Aiden, Ryder, Lucas, and Cade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| And needless to say, it was a lot more difficult to be in front of them than it is anyplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| else even in front of the rest of you commissioners here, but they did question me and gave me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| some things I needed to do, and here's some of the things that they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| Now, if you're not familiar with Adrian Burnett, it's the only wooden structured school in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| It takes about 600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| Some of the things that these kids asked for, now these were, I asked the principal if she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| put them up to this and said no, they came up this on their own, and just give you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| few of the things that they said that they wanted for their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| They wanted an improvement in their playground, so I went out to visit the playground, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| they had two places where they had playgrounds at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| They said they would like to have an after school program, such as an academy or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| of those Lego classes and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| They wanted more parking when they have open house for their parents to park at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| Now these are fourth and fifth grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| They wanted a place to have concerts, programs, and things where they could have it at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| own school, but they have to find places like churches and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| They wanted better signage up front next to the road, because the sign that they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| up there don't hold the letters anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| They wanted the community to know what was going on in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| They wanted to fix the open classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Too much noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| They have spaces between each classes where they make too much noise and they can't concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| on their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Another thing they asked for that was really important to them was they wanted the garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| trucks to stop coming during class time, because they made so much noise, because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| have those thick walls like everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| They also said that they would like better bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Did you know 75 teachers share one bathroom out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| Now think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| A lot of those are women, so there's a problem that's going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| The classrooms, anyway, I'm just trying to make a little bit of a joke out of that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| anyway, and it was a little bit of a joke, and out of 600 students, they have three bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| that have two or less toilets in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| These were some of the things that they were asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| The reason why I bring that up is when students ask for simple things like that, where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| we at to take care of that type of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| I will be happy to go back next year as a principal out there, and hopefully we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| bring them better messages about being principal, but let me tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| Those are very smart kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| The teachers are very excited, they smile, they enjoy, and they have an atmosphere out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| there like I haven't seen in many other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| It made me feel really terrible as a commissioner to not be able to really say I can take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4522)|
| 1:15:31| of every one of those problems, and as a community, we should take care of those problems, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4531)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| Since we've been talking about the Tennessee County Services Association, I did want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| point out that in the fall of 2019, the annual conference will be held in Knox County at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| the downtown Holiday Inn, and of course, utilizing the Knoxville Convention Center for our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| so that's kind of a good thing for Knoxville, because in Knox County, obviously having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| opportunity to have all the county mayors, the county highway officials, and our fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| county commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Just a quick shout out to my schools and district, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I was fortunate to be able to be principal for the day over at Inskip Elementary, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| they have a new principal this year whose name is Lynn Jackaman, and she's very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| She was dressed as Wonder Woman for the day, and she's out there opening corridors at 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| a.m. and has started a PTA this year, and on Fridays, she has a special assembly for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4606)|
| 1:16:55| the students and is recruiting people to come in and help give awards out on Friday mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| so if there's anyone out there listening in leadership, any of you commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| would like to go and join and meet with these students, she would very much welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| You can let me know, and I'm very pleased to say that this was a school that has lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| of wooden structures out beside it and fenced in and all, but as we all know, last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4642)|
| 1:17:31| or year before, Inskip was one of the schools that is supposed to be getting some renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| which they need desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| It's an area where a lot of children are very transit or they come and go, but they're full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4660)|
| 1:17:49| and it's also a Title I school, so I was very impressed with the staff there and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| children, and I had some that looked like future county commissioners or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| Very impressive students, so if you ever get a chance to go visit Lynn at Inskip, she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| more than welcome to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you to the school board for allowing us to have this opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I'd like to shout out to South Dole High School, where I went and was principal for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| The most impressive part about what I saw that day was career technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| We still have auto mechanics, auto body, HVC, building trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| After we did the tour of all the technical, and I wish we'd still had a small engine repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| because you can't find anybody working on a two-cycle with small engines anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| It's hard to do, but California, I've seen an article, the state of California is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| to spend hundreds of millions of dollars guiding students away from four-year colleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| to technical colleges because we do not have welders, carpenters, HVC plumbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4736)|
| 1:19:05| Even the left coast is figuring out that we need these career technical students, so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| you want to make a million dollars in about 12 years, go out and be a welder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| I promise you, you will make a million dollars in about 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Mr. Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Dwight, before you leave, I want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| Before I was sworn into office the first year I went past the primary, I went to a TCCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| I went down there, I didn't know that anybody else was going, and down there, and I walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| in and I introduced myself and was walking around and nobody was really speaking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| Then Dwight came up and said, what are you doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| I said, well, I paid my own way to get down here, but after he spoke to me, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| else down there came up and spoke to me, so his name is really well known down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| Since everybody's gone and nobody heard that, they'll understand that I'm not giving you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| any praises publicly, but anyway, I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| The way that the other people look at Dwight, ask him questions, and the respect that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| gave him to elect him president, it's just something else that ... Listen, I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| for what you do for the county, and thank you for how you present our county to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| I really appreciate the support from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| For those of you that are able to come and be engaged, it really does mean a lot to East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| We are the third largest county in our presence and representation there matter, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| over time, everybody can have some level of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| I believe in the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| I believe in the work that it does, and I'm proud to represent us, and I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4857)|
| 1:21:06| Thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| I had the privilege of going to Cedar Bluff Elementary and being principal for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| I went around with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| We went to four or five K through fourth grade classes and observed teacher techniques, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| way they're teaching our kids, and also got to sit in on a fourth grade level teacher's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| meeting and interact with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| I spent most of the day talking with the principal about what they need and exchanging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| ideas on what education needs in today's society to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| It was very enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| One of the highlights of the day was next door on the same campus at Cedar Bluff, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| have a special needs preschool that literally serves all of West Knox County and the amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| things that they're doing there in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| Does anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| I'd like to remind everybody about Thanksgiving and that we should all be humble and appreciative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| of what we have and be thankful and enjoy time with your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| I call to order this November meeting of the Commission Zoning Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4934)|

| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Before we get started, I wanted to let Mr. Kelly address an issue we've been having with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| giving notice to people that when they have a decision that comes before this body, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| have to be present for us to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| I have worked with Gerald Green and his staff to come up with some things to help give notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| Mr. Kelly, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Yes, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| The Planning Commission, after getting some direction from Mr. Smith, has, at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| of each of their meetings, they have an introductory remarks that they read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| We have added to that script, basically, it states the attached case is scheduled to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| heard by County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| You or your representative must be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| That's stated at the very front end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| They're told at that point, we provide a letter to each applicant, or I shouldn't say applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| On each application, there is a box that they fill out stating all correspondence related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| to this matter should be sent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| We send them a letter telling them in that letter that they're supposed to appear at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| this meeting if they want their matter heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Of course, there are, at the counter, when they come in and make application, we've instructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| our application technicians to inform everyone, you need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| I think they, short of picking them up and bringing them in, I think we've done about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| everything we can do to get their attention to come to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5059)|

| 1:27:14| I make a motion to approve up to 4 units, but I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| Go ahead with your questions, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| On this development right here, where are you going to have your entrance to the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5248)|
| 1:27:39| It's right there at the front of Emory Road where it abuts Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| There's currently a home that's there at the front and we're going to be taking down that home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| and that entrance comes off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| It's on the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| It is on the design plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| I also noticed on the design plan that you have a stub out that looks like it's going into the next subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| over to Emory Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| Was there a sidewalk design in that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Yes, that was one of the requirements with MPC that asked for that stub out to be over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| and it's just a walking path is what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| Just a walking path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| It's a pedestrian connection between Hoffa Estates and this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| That way the children, you know, the school is right across the road down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| and they'll be able to get down and get across Emory to the school if they are walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| It would be a lot easier to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| No, I was talking about the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| It looks like it curves in to go to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| You're going to have a walking strip between Emory Estates and the new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5317)|
| 1:28:47| I refer to it as Hoffa Estates, it's Emory Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Well, Emory Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5330)|

| 1:35:29| Mr. Chairman, can we have the MPC first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| MPC staff recommendation, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| As you well know, Commissioners, this matter has been up and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5741)|
| 1:35:49| At last month's meeting, you adopted a sector plan amendment to low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| This month, the matter before you is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| The applicant has requested up to 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| The MPC recommended 2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Previously, and last time it was before the Planning Commission, they continued to recommend 2 units per acre to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| Do you want anything other than that at this point, or do you want me to quit at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| You can continue if you wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| The Planning Commission did recommend 2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| The 2 units per acre does fall under the low density residential classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| If you did approve it at 2, 3, 4, 5, you would be in compliance with the sector plan as you amended it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5794)|
| 1:36:43| As you know, the 2 units per acre partially was recommended to you based on the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| That plan has been adopted by this body as a guide, and the guide is telling you 2 units per acre in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5812)|
| 1:37:01| The development, should you approve it at the density as requested by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| they do have a subdivision that was approved in 2016, I believe it was, that had approximately 60 lots in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| With the number of units that would be added between the 2 units per acre and the 5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| the traffic count would go from like 600 units, 600 trips per day, up to 1,450, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| That would necessitate the requirement for a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| which would be reviewed as part of the development review process, depending on how you deal with this rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5853)|
| 1:37:48| The traffic impact study is going to point out a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| The intersection alignment between the proposed development and Steel Road is close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| but it doesn't line up directly across, which is going to make getting the lane configuration possibly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5879)|
| 1:38:08| I think there's high likelihood that the traffic impact study will call for a left turn lane from Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| into the development, again, based on the 1,400 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| If that be the case, there is a left turn lane that goes into the school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| I think we're going to be creating a conflict point at a very heavily traveled intersection right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| The concept plan that we had that was approved previously for the 60 lots, Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5912)|
| 1:38:43| which is the main spine road that goes up into the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| and I think the new concept that I believe they have shared with you still shows a spine-type road going up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| The plan that we had previously, the road was 1,900 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| Of that section, 1,500 feet of that was at 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| Twelve percent is the maximum grade that we will allow for a public street or a joint permanent easement in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5945)|
| 1:39:15| You can go to a higher grade, but it would require a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| In order to get to 12%, the original plans that they submitted to us when they were doing the 60 lot subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| was actually a higher grade, and through work through their engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| was able to bring it down to the maximum grade that is permitted in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| The property is located within the parental responsibility zone for all the schools that are located there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5979)|
| 1:39:49| and as such, they would have to, or we would require that they construct sidewalks as part of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| to get them down to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| That is a signalized intersection there, so you can envision children walking to school from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| It's easier to walk to than from, given the steepness of the property going back up the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| but there is possibility of that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| With the 12% grade, the concept plan that they are proposing, when you include sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| they have to be constructed to be ADA compliant, and I believe it's going to be very difficult for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| That's going to be a point of discussion, again, through the development review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| For these reasons, we feel the Planning Commission supports density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| We don't have any issue with density, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| Density is good in the sense that it concentrates, utilizes public services, things like that, in a concentrated manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6045)|
| 1:40:54| On a steep piece of property, though, such as this, density is not the best thing to do at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| We don't approve density just for the sake of approving density sake, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6061)|
| 1:41:08| From that standpoint, we are standing firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| The Planning Commission is standing firm at two units per acre at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| Again, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| I have our engineer here, Billy Fulgham, who is prepared to address the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| that really would be more appropriately discussed at a use-on review, but I'll hit a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| Also, Mr. Rusty Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| You asked for people who are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| I think there may be a couple of people who are actually in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| Are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Would you stand up or raise your hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| It's hard to get people who support a development out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| It's easier to say no than yes, but they did manage to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| Last month, we were here to discuss the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| and you all amended the sector plan from two low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| which in the county is up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Part of the reason MPC did not make this recommendation earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| was because this property was thought to be covered by the urban growth boundary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| and you all and your lawyers have decided that it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| The rural residential, which would limit the property to two units per acre, is no longer in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| We are here asking for, I said, five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| In actuality, the best we could get out of the property is about four and a half units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| and that is still subject to a requirement that we go back to the MPC for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6168)|
| 1:42:59| When the property was limited to two units per acre by the urban growth boundary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| Mr. Biddle submitted a plan that resulted in 20 detached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| We are asking for increased density here to allow him to do townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| Yes, it will result in more homes, but it will result in less disturbance of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| I think, Mr. Fulgham, you just handed this out, did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| Under the previously approved plan, the land disturbance, per Mr. Fulgham, the engineer, would have been the red area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| Under the new plan, only the green area would be disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| so there would be less land disturbance under the proposed new plan than there was under the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6225)|
| 1:43:55| The entrance will line up to Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| I talked to Mr. Snowden, who was here at the earlier meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| and he said, yes, he and his department and Mr. Fulgham and his engineers have been working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| and they have an agreement that the entrance to this subdivision will line up with Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| It will be partially at Mr. Biddle's expense, but they are doing work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| So you will have what is unique to most of Hardin Valley, a subdivision that comes out on a traffic light onto Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6265)|
| 1:44:37| Mr. Fulgham can address how that will be done if we are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| Now, just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| There was one other thing I wanted to mention, then I was going to turn it over to Mr. Fulgham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| The subdivision, as I said, will be unique in that it can line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| The complaints I have seen, and there was an email furor today started, as I understand, by a Facebook post on one of the school Facebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6305)|
| 1:45:16| I'm not big on social media, but that's what I understood happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| It's about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| All right, Knox County is looking at this corridor, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| and it's in the planning stage only to address the traffic issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| However, for you all who travel Emory Road, I-275, I-40, Chapman Highway, Broadway, Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6334)|
| 1:45:45| and the other major arteries in town, I would urge you to compare the traffic counts on Hardin Valley Road to those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6345)|
| 1:45:56| and you would find that there is not near the congestion that you've heard complained about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| There have been complaints about grading already taking place on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| That has been done with a permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| Mr. Biddle, as the owner of the property, has the right to harvest the trees, and he has done that to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| but also it is partially being used as a borrow permit, and TDEC has issued a permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6383)|
| 1:46:31| They are in charge of that function, and if you have any questions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| I would suggest that you address it to Mr. Fulgham, who handled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| The land disturbance issue in this chart can be handled by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| and I gave this to Mr. Green at last month's meeting, and he said he will hold this to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| and I'm going to give it to Mr. Kelly and tell him if we can get this approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| that MPC hold the developer to the reduced land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| The other issues I would like to address, there was a question about a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| I think Mr. Kelly has addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| MPC will require a traffic impact study for a development such as Mr. Biddle is requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6439)|
| 1:47:29| and he will be required to do improvements to roads as suggested by that traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| one of which was suggested was a left turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| That is part of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| An issue was raised about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| As I understand from Mr. Fulgham, if your sidewalk follows your road, then there is not an ADA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6467)|
| 1:47:56| Otherwise, there would be a lot of places in the city of Knoxville and Knox County where you could not build sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| So sidewalks are not an issue if they will follow the road and that will be ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| If I may, am I out of time, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| You are, sir, but I'm keeping track to give opposition equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Mr. Fulgham, do you want to say anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| He's here to answer any questions you may have now or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| If not, I would urge you to approve the density at four and a half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| My name is Billy Fulgham with Fulgham-McInnes Associates, 10330 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| I'm here to answer any questions or as far as the work that we've done so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| whether this is 61 lots that was approved or 155 or 150, anywhere in that range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6531)|
| 1:48:59| the street is going to line up the same way regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| And that's already been approved and worked out with pretty much every member of Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| We've worked with Jim Snowden, Cindy Pionke, John Sexton, Leila Cameron on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| and so everything is lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| The work that they're doing across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| they've sent us that information to make sure that we're still lined up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| and we're still working together on that, and we've checked that to their satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6562)|
| 1:49:31| Another thing I heard was the slope of the 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| Originally, we submitted a concept plan and received a variance for 14%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| which is something that we do quite often in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| and the 14% was approved for this piece of property at this exact location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| Mr. Biddle had another person that wanted to look at a different concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| Based on that concept, we resubmitted the concept plan at 12% at the request of that particular client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6595)|
| 1:50:05| So we've really had two approved, one at 14%, one at 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| If we're able to come back with another concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| we will ask for the 14% so that we're not disturbing any more earthwork than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6614)|
| 1:50:24| You can look all over Hardin Valley or anywhere around the county, 14% is an acceptable grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| We've got 23% on the side of this building right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| Other than that, I didn't know if there were questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| I'd be glad to answer any that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| If we have any, sir, we'll be sure and ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| Ma'am, if you would restate your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| I'm Laurie Vollega. I live at 1833 L Rancho Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| And you have eight and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| The proposed development lies within our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| which is located on Beaver Ridge within a band approximately two miles wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| along Campbell Station Road and bordered by Hardin Valley Road and Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| We are in agreement with the approved housing density of two houses per acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| Our community housing density ranges from one house per 20 acres to two and a half houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6693)|
| 1:51:43| We oppose the requested rezoning of five houses per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| because it does not match our community's housing density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| and it will set a bad precedent for housing density of future development in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| The zoned housing density for a piece of property remains with the property through a sales transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| If the rezoning request of five houses per acre is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| then any owner can build 144 or 155 individual houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| because the zoning does not carry any specification for attached or detached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| Also, zoning carries no requirement that a specific development design must be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6742)|
| 1:52:30| Approximately 2,000 homes are in the pipeline to be built in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| The traffic impact of which has not yet been felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| If the rezoning request of five houses per acre is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| then any owner of this property can build up to, as we said, 144 or 155 individual houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| which is an increase of 52 houses over the approved 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| These 82 homes will add cars to the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| with the development's access at the Steel Road and Hardin Valley intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| These extra cars will increase the traffic congestion, which is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| They will also add traffic to the increasingly crowded North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| North Campbell Station is a main route to Turkey Creek Shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| Although traffic congestion problems tend to be solved retroactively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| there are two sections of Campbell Station Road which can only be widened at a huge expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| We've got a valley. We've got a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| The lay of the land prevents an affordable retroactive fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| In this case, it is crucial to be proactive and prevent traffic buildup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| to the point that widening these sections of Campbell Station Road will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6832)|
| 1:54:00| The MPC staff has evaluated this property twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| and determined that the maximum housing density should be two houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| The MPC board has voted twice in agreement with the staff that the housing density be two houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| The two votes were 11 to 1 and 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| We request that the County Commission vote to deny the rezoning request of five houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6867)|
| 1:54:37| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| We did have the community, most of the people were in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| that were out at the community where I had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| I've struggled with this zoning since the inception of it being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6886)|
| 1:54:56| I mulled it over, looked at the history of everything and the MPC notes and things like that over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| I told Arthur this morning that I don't feel like I can support anything over three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| Currently at two, and I think the urban growth plan, had it not been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| maybe three would have been on their radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| I can't support five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| I'll listen to more discussion and have a motion in a few minutes if somebody doesn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| That's just kind of where I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Anything over three to me, just based solely on topography and how this land sits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| I think it would be difficult to do it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| That's kind of my feeling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| I guess I'll chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| I've struggled with it, too, because the topography is pretty tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| It is a very unique piece of property in the sense that it is one of the few places you could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| slightly higher density because it has access to Hardin Valley via red light, a control point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| which is something that most of the subdivisions on Hardin Valley do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| Also, because it is within the parental zone of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| I think given this was a flat piece of land, Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| wouldn't we really try to concentrate density there because of its proximity to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| If it were flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6982)|
| 1:56:30| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Mr. Kelly, I'm trying to do the math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| In the MPC paperwork that was provided to us, it says the track size is 29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| And it says that they wanted to propose 155 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| That's over the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| That comes up to 5.34 dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| That number is based on the concept that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Biddle and Mr. Fulgham and I have already discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| They're aware that they've proposed more units than what can be approved, even at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| And then also with the documents that were provided, doing the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| it looks like that 72% of that track of land has slopes greater than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7032)|
| 1:57:23| and 39.5% of the track of land has slopes greater than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7043)|
| 1:57:32| Do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| I don't know what the percentages are, but the 0 to 15, 6.84 acres, 15 to 25, 9.42, 25 to 40%, 11.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7058)|
| 1:57:51| greater than 40% is 0.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| That comes up to over 21 acres of the 29-acre track of land that's over 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7077)|
| 1:58:06| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7092)|
| 1:58:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| I know a lot of these people sitting out here, and having lived in Hardin Valley for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7104)|
| 1:58:32| I know a lot of these people sitting out here on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| So it's another issue that Hardin Valley is going to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| There's going to be plenty more of them coming each way, and that's just the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7121)|
| 1:58:49| Hardin Valley is just the place where everybody wants to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| The people who are out there don't want anymore, and it's already a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| And we know that TDOT's not helping a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| and we know that Knox County increases the money to operate on by building houses instead of raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7140)|
| 1:59:10| But this is the hottest community we're living in, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| Anderson County, maybe Blount County because of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| But it's going to be a problem on both sides of Pellissippi, not just on your side, but the other side too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| and it's already starting over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| So I don't know exactly what the answer is going to be until TDOT actually comes forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7166)|
| 1:59:33| and works on the intersection with Pellissippi and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| And then on up the street, we're going to have issues at Carmichael Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| with subdivisions being built on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And TDOT's talking about closing some of the entrances and exits from Pellissippi Parkway onto those side roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| And if they do that, then you'll have to drive all the way down to some community road to get off and get back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| So when this happens, it just continues to build on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| There's just more problems down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| I'm inclined to vote with the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| because if you've taken the time to come up here, and I see some of you here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| this is your third time at commission to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| And Rusty's a good friend, and his dad's a great friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| but they can't get it worked out with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| They go from one to another to another to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| We've looked at it, sent it back, they've declined it, sent it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| and it keeps going from one thing or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| So that's my position on the issue. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| Mr. Kelly, whenever we set by the ridgetop slope protection guidelines density per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7243)|
| 2:00:51| is there any interpretation in that for volume of dirt moved versus units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| Yes, in applying the hillside and ridgetop plan in an actual development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| there is what's developed that's called a grading budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| And in the materials that we provided to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| where it's the page that has slope analysis on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| on the back side it talks about the grading budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| The area that is zero to 15% under the hillside protection area, you can grade 100% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| 15% to 25%, you can grade 50% of that acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| 25% to 40%, 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| What we try to do, the way we have applied that is we add the acreages up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7301)|
| 2:01:50| and say based on these classifications, how many acres can you grade on the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7310)|
| 2:01:59| And it would come up to somewhere between around 13 to 14 1⁄2 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| if you did the math on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| Now the question is, Mr. Biddle has, as correctly stated by Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| has gone in and logged the property off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| has done significant rearrangement of the earth through that process already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| So to what degree do you apply the hillside plan after the cat's out of the bag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7348)|
| 2:02:38| I guess you could say that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| If we zone this up to a certain unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| it comes back before MPC for a final approval at a certain number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| MPC does have the ability to not go to that max number, do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Depending on what engineering and further development plans have been submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| There's a guy standing up in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| and I didn't want him not to be recognized if he wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Yes, sir. Do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| My name is Chip Fisher, 11346 Samley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| I am here to represent or speak on behalf of the people of the community of Hardin Valley that are for the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7404)|
| 2:03:33| We've got a school there in Hardin Valley Academy that is drawing a lot of people to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7413)|
| 2:03:41| They want to be there because the education is so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| In my involvement with the school and working with the kids and football over there and baseball and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| you talk to a lot of people, and a lot of people are for this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| I appreciate their stand, but there are a lot of people looking at growth as a good thing for Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7436)|
| 2:04:05| and I think it's important that their voice is heard too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| I just wanted to be heard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| My name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| My name is Bob Valiga, address 1833 El Rancho Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| Our little neighborhood group has taken the stance from the beginning of not going to no building at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7471)|
| 2:04:39| We're for growth, and we're for preservation of the beauty of Knoxville and Hardin Valley and the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7479)|
| 2:04:51| We think that growth can be achieved, and we can also have a preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| so we're looking for a responsible, balanced growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| and we decide on the side of the MPC on this one that five units per acre is probably pushing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7501)|
| 2:05:10| and that's why we've requested initial two units per acre, 62 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7510)|
| 2:05:17| So we're looking for a balance to try to preserve what is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| Growth is not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| Growth is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| We all have the food city to thank for that, and we have schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| So we're looking for what would be a great overall development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| and that's why we're looking for a reasonable, responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7540)|
| 2:05:50| Yes, sir, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| My name is Bill Jones, or William Jones, formally, at 1822 El Rancho Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| and I think you handed out the lay of the land with the color coding for the amount of disruption of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7558)|
| 2:06:08| and I don't know whether you also received his arrangement of the townhouses that he plans on putting on that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7568)|
| 2:06:16| and if you do have that, if you would look at the way it's rendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| that all of these 144, 155, et cetera, units are abutting the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7581)|
| 2:06:30| Now, there is no frontage on these units for any type of resident use, and that especially includes parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7590)|
| 2:06:42| Mr. Biddle has indicated he has a one-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| Most people that are going to be residing there will have, I would say most people will have more than one car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| They're going to have a few boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| They're going to have some motorcycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| They're going to have some trucks that they use for their employment and work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| and there is no allocation for this additional vehicular arrangement on this unless he puts a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7620)|
| 2:07:09| Well, if he puts a setback on this, then this color-coded layout of excavation goes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| because you've got to excavate further, make arrangement for some sort of frontage for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7636)|
| 2:07:25| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| With that said, you have, because of the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| Can I interrupt you one second and get clarification from MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| There is a required setback on anything built, is there not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| It depends on whether he's doing it as condominiums or on lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| and if it's done as a condominium project, the only setback is around the periphery of the land itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7665)|
| 2:07:55| We do encourage, and as the gentleman was saying, they are going to have to provide parking for each individual unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7675)|
| 2:08:03| so the buildings will be set back to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Well, if that's the case, then his color-coded excavation plan has to be expanded in order to accommodate that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7689)|
| 2:08:20| Now then, you've got two bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| One is not quite as steep as the other, but one is steep, and it's got to be filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| I've got an engineer here who can describe that better than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| but with that 29 acres, he cannot use all of that 29 acres because of the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7714)|
| 2:08:43| So he's got a density of much more per acre than is indicated by 5 flooding units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7723)|
| 2:08:53| because a good portion of that land will not be buildable when it's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7733)|
| 2:09:03| There needs to be just a reduction in order to accommodate that many dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7743)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| Yes, I just wanted to address the comments about the setbacks in the frontage and then the disturbed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| Obviously, the disturbed area is something that we've worked out on a conceptual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| and was trying to be conservative as far as how much we would probably disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| This is not a detailed design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| My hope would be we would reduce the limits that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| As far as the parking, they'll have a one-car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| and then the driveways will look like any other single-family residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| Any of these new subdivisions in Hardin Valley that either are ball homes or Saddlebrook or someone is building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| it will still be off the road the same distance that any of these homes would be off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| The county will require you to have at least 20 foot off of the right-of-way in order to have a car in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7803)|
| 2:10:12| That will be shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Again, so there will be setbacks regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| There will be townhomes, and the driveways will be consistent with the subdivisions that we're designing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| all throughout Hardin Valley and throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| Mr. Kelly, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Yes, I'd like to ask Billy a question if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| You talked about doing the road at 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| Given these are multi-unit structures, you're going to come down, shelf out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| I assume it's going to be a building like that, in order to be able to get an ADA-compliant sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7846)|
| 2:10:53| In addition to the driveway for the car, we've been talking about a sidewalk coming down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| Again, Arthur is correct that the sidewalk can follow the grade of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| but the street's going to come down, and it's going to have to flatten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| because the driveways aren't going to go into each of these units at 14% on a side slope at 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7869)|
| 2:11:17| That's going to have to be flattened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| In order to be able to make that transition and then go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| are you confident that you can put an ADA-compliant sidewalk in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| The units, you have really two options when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| One is crossface, or the other one is slabs, but the foundations would have to be stepped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| So that's the only two ways of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| I just wanted to ensure that he believes that they can get an ADA sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7905)|
| 2:11:53| Dan, what is some of the spot zoning, not spot zoning, it's not a good word to use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| what is some of the other zoning densities that are used within the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| Arthur, perhaps you know. Dan, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| No, but I'm sure they're probably across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| I don't know about five, but I'd be willing to bet you there's two, three, four within close proximity to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7931)|
| 2:12:20| Again, given the grade of the property, traffic issues, things like that, that's why we're making our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7940)|
| 2:12:28| Arthur, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| As I understand, there is medium-density sector plans near the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Which would allow up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| The sector plan is already approved for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| If you look in the whole Hardin Valley corridor, there is everything from 12, 10, I think I've seen 6, 5, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7966)|
| 2:12:58| I mean, it's across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| It's MDR behind the schools and everything else is LDR or RR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| Well, there's some acreage. Is it behind the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| It's MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| MDR, which would allow up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| There are 12 units per acre at the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| Earlier tonight, you approved the apartments where the zoning went from BP to OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=7999)|
| 2:13:28| That's 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| That was at Pellissippi and was it Carmichael?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| At Carmichael Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| That's not medium-density or low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| Which feeds into Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Only tonight, you've approved 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| But the densities are all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| Yes, sir, you wanted to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| Referring to the community size, we talked about plus or minus a mile on either side of Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8037)|
| 2:14:03| and between Hardin Valley Road and Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| That's part of Beaver Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| We're speaking towards ridgeland versus valleyland here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| Valleyland is much easier to build on in higher densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| Without destroying the ridges, you have to really do a lot of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| Right now, the highlands at Hardin Valley, right next to El Rancho Trail subdivision, is being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8062)|
| 2:14:30| It's in this process of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| The original size of that property was 20 acres, and they're putting up 50 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| That density is 2.5 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Just south of them, down Campbell Station Road, Brandywine at Pepper Ridge is being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8081)|
| 2:14:50| Because of the lay of the land there, the density of that subdivision is 1.6 houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| That gives you an idea of the really steep areas where density has to drop significantly off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| Those are the two that I know of within that community that we've defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| Beaver Ridge, closer to the parkway, does have a substantial area that is zoned at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8113)|
| 2:15:23| I'd like to make a motion that we approve at no more than three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8123)|
| 2:15:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8135)|
| 2:15:43| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| Let me ask a question of the developer, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| I heard the design of this was a single car garage and a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| The driveway is going to be about what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| What width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| I'm not sure what the width would be, but it would probably be a minimum of 20 to 25 feet in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| In depth, but width, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| It's going to supply a single car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| The units are relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| They're 1,350 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| By asking that, what demographic type customer are you looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| I think we'll get a lot of single people and a lot of single parent people as well, and some retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| About how many bedrooms is each unit going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| There will probably be two bedrooms, two and a half baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| This question is for Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| In his statement to the community, you were saying that you were in favor of supporting what they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| Was that basically two units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| Commissioner Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| I'd like to hear the opposition's response to the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8215)|
| 2:17:01| The opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Not the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| The community's response to the three houses that are recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| I just like to hear what their response is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8228)|
| 2:17:26| We just took an informal poll, and we're willing to compromise at three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8246)|
| 2:17:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Just a quick confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| One of the NPCs says 30.48 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| Mr. Bittles, may I answer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| And the other one says 29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Are we at 30.48 or are we at 29?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| I need my magnifying glass, but it's surveyed out at a little over 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| It's 30.48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| So we're going to be at 30.48 at three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| Just to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8285)|
| 2:18:14| I think they took in one of those commercial lots to do the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| I think that's the difference in the number, isn't it, Trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Actually, that number is coming from the final plot that was recorded years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| That would be about 92 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| 91.44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| Go Maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| This is kind of a point of information to the opposition, to this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| because I spoke to several of you over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| And in our conversations, there was a point made about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| can a developer, once he gets approval from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| can he turn around tomorrow morning and sell the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| And the answer was yes, that they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| And then I don't know if anybody else, but I had a phone call today saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| if the density was going to be higher, they were going to be buying the project from Mr. Bittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8344)|
| 2:19:12| So I don't know if anybody else had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8352)|
| 2:19:19| There is absolutely no truth in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| Do you know of Frank, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Oh, I did get that call, but I didn't return it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| He just left a message and talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Yeah, he said he's buying it from him if he got the five units per acre, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| Who is it? Frank Wyckoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| He's in the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| I have full intentions of doing this development myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| So that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| If I could say one thing, the three units per acre really doesn't help me for single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| There is no way to get more than 62 single family homes on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| That's what we maxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| And what's happened is the development cost is higher than what the lots are worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| That's why we are trying to develop less, a smaller area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| and get the density up is to get the cost per lot down, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| Mr. Bittle, a two-bedroom, two-bath or bath and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| They're two-bath, two-and-a-half baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| Two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath, 1,300 square foot, one-car garage townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| What is the projected selling price of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| They will be under $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Are there any homes available in Hardin Valley, new construction, under $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| No. What's funny is today I got calls from people that saw the Facebook posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| that were interested in buying the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| So there is no market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| There is a void out there for that product, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| These are not cheap homes. They're an all-brick product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| They will be built very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| I just wanted to say that I think the price point is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| I think the discussion about townhomes in the area for single professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| or young families is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| I just don't think this piece of property can handle that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| and I made a commitment to those over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| and to everybody I talked to about the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| And, Rusty, if you don't want the three, we'll pull it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| and you can have a discussion later about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| You guys can vote as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| I would ask for a little more density if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| Okay, well, I'm going to ask on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| to make a substitute motion that we vote on first at four and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8492)|
| 2:21:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8502)|
| 2:21:51| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| Call to question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| Okay, so we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| We have a motion of three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask the question of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| Is three per acre going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| What happens is instead of being $179,000, those houses go to $199,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| and they want to praise out, so the lot cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| what you can't develop out of those $155,000, that number is $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8549)|
| 2:22:33| I figured it's $600,000 if I went to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| So that's $600,000 that goes into the lot you're trying to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| and it just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| The math doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Four units per acre would get me close to that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| that would make the product sellable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| When you call for the question, doesn't that stop discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| No, it's up to the chairman's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| Let me make a substitute motion, if I could, on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| We're getting closer to a unit here that makes it affordable for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| I'm going to make the motion that we go to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| I'd like to hear from the opposition about what they think of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8614)|
| 2:23:49| I appreciate Mr. Riddle's predicament financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| I've made a few bad investments in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| When you look at that land and the excavation that has to take place to accomplish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8637)|
| 2:24:07| and then you put that density in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| the Healy property, which is right close by, within 200 yards, has a 20-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8651)|
| 2:24:21| There's a little over two houses for that 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8661)|
| 2:24:29| But a good portion of the back of that 20 acres is not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| He will have the same situation where some of that land is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| If you put single units in or he puts townhouses in, the land is not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8679)|
| 2:24:47| You're trying to get a density in there that isn't practical for the terrain that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| The rest of the neighborhood would like to stand at three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| Commissioner Bossler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| The reason why I was making that motion is, and I was asking what the units look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8712)|
| 2:25:19| and we're getting to the point in some of our areas here where you have a lot of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| I mean, well, things around there that can support the people that would be living in that type of unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8726)|
| 2:25:33| What I'm seeing in my area, I'm having a lot of, like me, that has a lot of gray hair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| and they're downsizing, and they're going to these size units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| They don't require a lot of land, and they don't do a lot of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| but they do like to live close to certain facilities and being able to get on and off and go places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| With that, why I was asking so much of what the design is, I'm looking for things down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8755)|
| 2:26:03| and I'm even looking at my district of how we can take care of the fastest growing part of our society right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| is the senior citizens that have places that they want to downsize from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| Even at my age, I have downsized to this last home I'm in by about 1,500 square feet from off the original home I was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8777)|
| 2:26:28| Now, having said that, I'm just looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| This is a nice place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| It has good infrastructure right now as far as it may be real busy, but so is some of the places in my area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| but there are things that developed around it where my generation can get to it very easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8801)|
| 2:26:51| and they don't have a lot to take care of while they're living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| If that's not something that you want in that, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| I'm just trying to make that type of housing available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| It wouldn't be for young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| They wouldn't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| They have two or three cars and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| I'll just give you an option there, and that's why I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| May I remind Commissioner Busseler that these townhouses have stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| They're two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| They would not be that amenable to the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| Also, they're built on a 16% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8850)|
| 2:27:39| If they're as old as I am, they'll have trouble walking up that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| You're 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| Okay, is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| Mr. Seymour, anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| Four is better than three, so we would like four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| That's the present substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| That's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| I realize the site has issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| All the good sites in Knox County are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| That land is not there anymore, so we're dealing in a challenging environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| trying to provide housing for all the people who want to move here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| which is 4,000 or 5,000 people a year, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| Well, I'll have to argue about all the good places are gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| because just west of this property is a huge flat farm of over 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8912)|
| 2:28:40| so there'll be lots more built down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| But MPC will only recommend two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| I believe we've ended our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| We would say that three is a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| and remind that this, if I understand it, this is just a vote on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| not on the design, just the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| Sir, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| This is a vote, if I understand it, not the design of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| Just the rezoning, not the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| Just the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| We're voting on four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| The proper motion is in a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Can we have a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| Just make sure they're recorded correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Roll call vote starting in the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| We started in the first, last roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=8982)|

| 2:31:29| Tom Simon's application for the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| It was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Yes, and the law director has informed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| that for a closure, the applicant does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| need to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Mr. Gentry reminded me he was a client of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| You're trying to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| You don't need to represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| He doesn't have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| He had no need to charge me anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| Six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9112)|
| 2:31:52| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| He didn't call me, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| He wanted me to do this before the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| Yeah, let's go ahead and get it out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| 10-A-17-S-N-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9123)|

| 2:32:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9129)|
| 2:32:09| Jarrett Benson, 1905 South Hills Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| unrelated to pretty much everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| except the opening statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| Notice of this meeting, of which I wasn't given any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| And one of these nice gentlemen, and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| apologize, I don't remember who, called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| It was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9144)|
| 2:32:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| And asked to see my packet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| I would receive from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| And also, I wanted to note, after both meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| this is my first time in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| and I hope to do it a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| But after both of my meetings, zoning and use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| after the meeting, directly, I walked upstairs and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| am I done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Is this everything I need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| And the guys at the counter said, you're all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| You're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9166)|
| 2:32:46| To me, that means I'm all set, good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| There's no more secret meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| We don't have secret meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| Secret to me, I guess, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| But I think what's being miscommunicated here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| is you are done with them at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| but you're not done completely with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| Where would I find out about this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| I guess would be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9191)|

| 2:33:35| Not received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Blame it on the USPS, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| But anyway, did you want to see my papers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9222)|

| 2:33:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9224)|

| 2:33:49| came through in September, and hopefully no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| will be caught not knowing that they're not supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| And I appreciate your all's work on that, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9236)|

| 2:36:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Dan, I see on the future agenda on December the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| you have item 64, consideration of a sidewalk policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| Is there any way that we can get some information more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| on what that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| I'll have to get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| The planning commission in dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| with the subdivision regulations took some action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| that they are wanting to hold in abeyance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| and get into working with all people involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| from both sides of the table as far as the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| community and those who are strong advocates for sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| and trying to come up with some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| as to when they would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| and how they would be constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| There may be give and take that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| going to occur there, potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| with reducing street widths and things like that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| may hold costs in line if they have to provide sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| And the only reason why I bring this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| is I noticed that there was a house out in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| that was subdivided off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| And they were starting to build the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| And because it was subdivided, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| were putting in a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| And it goes nowhere on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| And I was wondering, because we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| have to keep on that piece of concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| You've got me on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| That would be highly unusual for one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| But if you subdivide it under the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| you're required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9472)|
| 2:37:53| Not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| Not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| Are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9477)|
| 2:37:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| The subdivision regulations, as approved by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| Commission, says that the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| may require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| And the policy that they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| adhering to for some number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| now has basically been within the PRZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| that the responsibility zone is where they've been required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| But that has only been in subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| that have multiple lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| It's not where some guy has divided his property into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| Now, if he's in a subdivision and dividing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| He's a, it's on the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| But it is in the parental zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| But there's no other sidewalks on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| Would that be a coding issue that they've done it wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| I'll do it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| But anyway, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| If you will give me the address or something associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9528)|
| 2:38:52| with the property, I will find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9535)|
| 2:38:55| Before everybody leaves, I'm supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| to let you know that the Sheriff's Department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| some frozen Thanksgiving sausage for you back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9546)|
| 2:39:06| Happy Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| Rocky Hill Christmas Parade, December 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| Are we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171120?start=9555)|
