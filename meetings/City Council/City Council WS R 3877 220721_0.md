| 0:01:30| Seven present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| All right, this workshop is in response to constituent input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| about increasing noise levels in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| Although increased noise levels are not isolated to our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| tonight Council will hear about what is causing these increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| in the downtown pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Joining us this evening is Deputy to the Mayor Aaron Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| and Carter Hall, who will be leading our presentation this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Is that on cue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| And I'll also mention we brought our lawyer for good measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| always helpful to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| But thank you for calling this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| and it's really our pleasure to provide to Council an overview of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| pilot demonstration that we have been running for roughly about six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| And this is in response to a significant and recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| and growing more frequent concern, not only in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| but also in other neighborhoods throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| So in response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Carter has become quite an expert on noise in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| but really specifically looking at strategies that cities have pursued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| and explored all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| because what is clear in this problem is that this is not a Knoxville problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| It is happening in increasing levels all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| especially in metro and urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| And we can all hypothesize as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| I'm not sure that anyone scientifically studied the cause of why these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| happening, but many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| many cities across the country are looking for effective strategies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| It is one, again, not just here, but across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| something that from a technology and a staffing perspective is notoriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| And we'll talk a little bit about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| especially when we consider the intensity of resources that's required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| enforce the ordinance with traditional tools, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| So we know, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| that we have to evaluate those strategies in the context of other high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| priority issues that require time of our officers at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| So we have looked at this from a policy standpoint and run this demo with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| eye toward how do we find strategies that maybe are not in that more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| traditional realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| that can be something that is sustainable and less intensive in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| use of our officers' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| We know that this can be frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| and I will give you the punchline that there are no silver bullets to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| but we hope that we can see an eye toward a future in which we might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| able to get toward an effective strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| So that's kind of the real level-setting news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| On the other hand, with the deployment of the camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| I would say that we are at the cutting edge of addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| When we started the demo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| we were one of only two cities in the country that had deployed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| the other being New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| And since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Carter has heard from literally dozens of other cities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| and we're not talking about smaller towns looking to their larger neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| We're talking about Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| We're talking about Miami Beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| We're talking about really large metro areas who have encountered this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| and are looking toward Knoxville because we are a step ahead of them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| terms of our ability or our interest in using technology to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| So we found the technology to be very reliable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| and it has given us a better understanding of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| and that understanding is what we can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| position ourselves to better understand precise strategies to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| very real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| So we've learned a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| and that's what Carter's going to walk you through tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| We'll review the local context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| including the concerns that we've heard as well as the challenges associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| with being responsive to those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We'll walk you through the actual noise camera technology and what it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| found and the data that it's gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| and then we'll close with some next steps that we see in terms of how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| work toward a viable long-term approach that can, importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| deter people from coming downtown to create a disruption and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| holding them accountable when they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| So without much further ado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| let me turn it over to Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| and he will walk us through his great presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| and he's really done the heavy lifting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| So, again, as he did with scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| he has become quite the expert and is ready for all of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you very much, Erin, and good afternoon, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Carter Hall, Policy and Business Innovation Manager for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I will be taking us through the presentation on the noise camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| I think Erin did a really great job at not just letting us know about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| agenda, which you can see up on the screen now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| but also setting some context for where we are at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| how, generally speaking, the pilot has gone so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and really also hitting just on how we understand this is a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| frustrating issue for downtown residents and business owners and then just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| anybody who visits downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| I think that this is, as Erin mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| the beginning of our ability to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| We certainly have not found the silver bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| and we are not here to say that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| but we think that this is a good step in trying to be creative and innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| at dealing with this issue that impacts a really important part of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| With that, we know that excessive vehicle noise has been a consistent complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| from downtown residents, but we have really seen an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Really, these concerns are on loud engine revving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| whether or not a vehicle is at a stop sign or a stoplight and are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| or they are on a straightaway and are hitting the gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Largely, probably a big part of that issue are modified mufflers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| which is not just a sound concern, but also an environmental concern as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Then also, just have heard from folks in terms of racing and parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and generally speaking on our streets, which is, again, not just a noise issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| but also a safety one at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| As Erin mentioned, Knoxville is certainly not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| We know that cities around the country have really struggled with this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| not just in terms of an increase in the amount of noise violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| that they have seen from vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| but also in their ability to deal with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Just to provide some context when we're talking about our noise ordinance going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| I did want to review that all with you briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Again, we're talking about Chapter 17, which is our motor vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| and traffic part of our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| This is separate from Chapter 18 that deals with stationary noises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| from things like a business or a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| That's where there's some nuance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| We're really talking about two main parts of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| You all should have a printout of the full ordinance if you want to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| but the main highlights there are the point on modified mufflers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| and muffler cutouts that create excessive noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| or excessive pollution being illegal by city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I believe we also have a state ordinance addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| What we do not have a state law on, but we do have in our local ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| is the noise limit, basically saying that any vehicle above 6,000 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| which is going to be most vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| is limited at 86 decibels at speed limits under 35 miles per hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| and 90 decibels at speed limits above 35 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Just so you all know, 90 decibels, we're talking like that's being at a concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| or standing next to a leaf blower that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| These are things that traditionally people use hearing protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| being that close to noises that loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| These are things I think we could all agree are very excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| We're not talking about smaller sounds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| To provide some context on where we're at with enforcement up until this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| we know that excessive vehicle noise is hard to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| due to both technology and staffing limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| Stationary consistent noise, as I mentioned, that is established in Chapter 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| That's something like from a house party or a business that's being really loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| a bar or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| It's a little bit easier to enforce just because it's not moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| and generally that sound is going to be happening for a longer period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| say like hours on end, not a handful of seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| We've also seen some sort of technological limitations in enforcing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Again, this is something that not just the city of Knoxville has experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| but traditional handheld decibel readers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| they have to be calibrated for ambient noise that's around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| for a consistent and legally upstanding noise reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| That can be hard, especially when you're trying to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| the way that noise bounces off of buildings in a more urban or dense setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| There are limitations when it comes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| It's not just as simple as someone pulling out a noise reader and taking a reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| and saying, okay, we can write a citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| or let somebody know that they're being excessively loud in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| With that, we've seen that also there can be legal troubles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| with when you write a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| that is obviously going to be able to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Somebody who receives a citation could contest that citation in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| and the burden of proof requires both technical knowledge of sound itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| but then also really understanding the equipment that was used to issue that citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| on top of being able to speak to the physics of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| which is something people dedicate their whole academic careers to understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Just important for you all to know, when it comes to enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| our city court is limited by state law to $50 fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| You will see later on when we talk about what some other cities have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| their proposals, or I've heard it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| can we just really increase our fines for a noise violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| I just want to say up top we are limited to $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| when we're talking about city court issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| That brings us to the actual noise camera pilot where we are at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| In late 2021, we connected with the vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| who makes the noise camera called Intelligent Instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| They are a London-based firm that has developed the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| to capture excessive vehicle noise events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I'm going to use the term events throughout this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| That's also just any sort of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| so any time a vehicle is above 86 decibels, we're going to call that an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| The camera was already used in London for, I believe, about a year before we got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| and New York had deployed theirs for, I think, a whopping week or two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| before we got ours, so again, relatively new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| The company offered us a free demo to test the camera technology in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| said, hey, we're happy to send this over to you guys, get a feel for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I think the company is relatively new themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| so they were really interested to see how municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| incorporate it into their systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| During the demo, we have used the camera to gather data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| on noise events that are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| really understand those issues better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| and use that data to precisely target actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| It's really important to note that we have not used the camera to issue any citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| and we also have not used it to issue warnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| although that tool was available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| We did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| We deployed the camera in February of 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| on the corner of Gay Street and Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| That's a picture of it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| If you have not seen it in person, it's pretty cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| It is a little bit bigger than a lunchbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| It's in a weatherproof case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| We have not, just for the record, have not experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| once it was all set up properly and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| we have not experienced any technical issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| It has seemed to weather all literal and proverbial storms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| and so it's technologically created really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| The city policy team is the one who manages the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| the footage and data review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| and all policy decisions associated with the demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Our police department and other enforcement bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| have not had system access at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| so it's really just lived in the policy department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| particularly just with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| As far as I know, I'm kind of the only one with a login at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| Well, I can confirm I am the only one with a login.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| To talk a little bit about how the camera actually works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| it has two cameras, each at a stationary angle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| to capture the front and back of a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| as it's driving through an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| There's a noise meter on the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| that is listening for sounds that are louder than 86 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| If it picks up an event louder than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| that is going to trigger a recording of the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| That recording is typically around 10 seconds long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| I've seen them as long as 15 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| as short as 6 or 7 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| just however long it's recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| the sort of bell curve of the noise event happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| And then after the noise event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| the camera is immediately going to send that footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| and the noise meter recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| to our software interface that we get on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| I sort of describe that as looking like an email inbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| where you can just kind of click through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| and see the events as they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Here's actually what I'm able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| when I see a noise event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| This is a real-life one, obviously, on Gay Street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Just to kind of describe what you're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| on the left side there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| the left picture is the empty intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| of Gay Street and Clinch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| and on the right where the vehicle is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| that is as it's driving down Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| towards Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| That vehicle is going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| You can see that this specific time is right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| This is a 14-second recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| This is right at about eight seconds in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| And I went ahead and just picked this specific time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| because this was the height of the decibel reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| That line below the footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| is the noise level for the recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| You can see right there at the level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| specifically as this vehicle came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| is at 102.7 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| so that is obviously very well above the legal limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| And we are able to use...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| This is all of the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| that is available to us with the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| It's just the recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| And I have blacked out the license plate for this example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| but the relevant thing here is you are able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| using the camera, it's a pretty high-definition camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| so you're able to see the license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| You're able to see the number clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And that's where you would potentially be able to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| and use that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| In a world where you're citing using the camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| you would connect that to your system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| plug in the license plate number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| get the information there, and issue it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Really important distinction here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| that it's not like a red-light camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| which is going to automatically issue a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| If, hypothetically, you were using the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| to issue a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| that would all have to be manually done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| and manually reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| and you would be able to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| hey, yeah, we are going to use this evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| to issue a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| or there might be a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| why you would choose not to issue a citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| based on the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| There are some things below there that you can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| things like recording if it is a foreign license plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| if it was a false positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| if you've seen the vehicle before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| so if you're trying to keep track of frequent offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and then just some other data that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| But again, in terms of the main bulk of what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| it is the actual video recording and the noise reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Just to be curious, there is a night option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| It does work at nighttime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Using the camera over the last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| we've, again, been using it to do data observations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| put together data reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| and at this point, that's where I'm going to dig| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| into what we've learned a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| As of July 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| we have seen around 1,300 excessive noise events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| that we've recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| and the average event is around 90 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| so that is pretty significantly higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| than our noise ordinance allows for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Again, I've mentioned this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| but that's equivalent to a concert or a leaf blower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| and we've really seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| that the excessive noise violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| have happened in clusters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| and they tend to range between 90 and 100 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| What I mean by clusters is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| when we talk about the time that they happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| that's something that we were really looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| is what time are these happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Are these consistently happening throughout a 24-hour period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Are they happening in a bunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| happening in the sort of similar ranges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Are there any trends that we could identify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| The clear answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| We'll look into that a little bit more later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| but we did definitely find clusters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| that these events were happening in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| We found that while there certainly were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| like souped-up sedans and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| we found that it was a lot of pickup trucks and motorcycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| and groups of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| that were coming up the most often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| That is a little bit of an anecdotal thing for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| just having gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| and I haven't personally looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| at every single one of the 1,300 events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| but from what I've gone and picked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| those stuck out more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| at least in a way where it was maybe counterintuitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| to what I was initially thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| It's not like a bunch of sports cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| We think that these violations are most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| to have modified mufflers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| That's just based on knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| that an unmodified V4 engine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| so that's what's in an average sedan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| is going to run between 50 and 60 decibels loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| A motorcycle is going to average 80 decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| when unmodified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| which is still pretty loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| but not illegally loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| However, it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| that really common modifications to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| especially motorcycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| like a straight pipe muffler that could be put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| is going to easily bump up the decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| that that vehicle or motorcycle is outputting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Like I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| straight pipe modification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| which is a really common one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| can make the motorcycle put out decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| up to 110 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| so we're talking really, really loud at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And from a trade magazine that I was reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| because now I'm reading auto trade magazines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| it was saying that a modification like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| is not a question of if the owner of a motorcycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| is going to do that modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| It's a question of when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Take that what you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| but that's what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Interestingly, on that time point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| the peaks were really between 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| We're at 8 a.m. on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| and 2 a.m. on Sundays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| but that's in the same morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| so that's in the same period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Important, though, that they are at those periods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| not between those periods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| and I'll show you guys a little bit more in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| but we have really seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| that there are these significant peaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| especially on that 8 p.m. Saturday point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| And then, again, this is somewhat anecdotal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I don't have specific pinpoint data on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| but I have not found that it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| a small group of vehicles causing the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| like we thought it might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| We were wondering beforehand, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| hey, is this the same 25 vehicles over and over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I've not found that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| It is, well, it's certainly not 1,300 individual vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| There are repeats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Generally speaking, we are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| varying vehicles and owners at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| Some hard numbers that I do have for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| are the number of events by decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| It might be a little hard for you all to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| but the most common one is 90.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| This one graph, future graphs, are up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| This one is from late April of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| but that is the most common one is 90 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| You do see some in the even higher ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| up to 105, 106 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| but the bulk are in the 88 to 95 decibel range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| This is a time scatter plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| This is, again, some really helpful data here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| The x-axis is going to be the hours of your day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| so the far left side is midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| The far right side is going to be 11, 55 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| You can really see on the left side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| that big cluster right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| is happening between 2 and 4 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| That's a lot in the 90 decibel range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| and between 80 and 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| but then I also wanted to point out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| that 8 p.m. time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| which is the circled group on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| That's some of, interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| our loudest violations are happening around dinner time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| This is across the seven-day period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| so this is not just on a Saturday or Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| the general weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| but, again, interestingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| we've seen that really high cluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| of the high-level sounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and then into the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| kind of goes to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| this is not just consistently happening throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| We're really seeing it happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| when people are downtown trying to eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| or go to businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| and then when downtown residents are trying to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| is when we're seeing a lot of these happen, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| not necessarily during the middle of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| At this point, this brings us to our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| We do plan to purchase the one camera that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| We're getting a deal on it from the vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| and we can use this camera, station it at different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| really going to focus on commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| and be able to deploy the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| The camera and the software costs $27,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| and we are going to continue to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| enforcement options at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| We hope to initiate partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| to enable technology-based enforcement options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| A part of that might be issuing a request for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| seeking a service provider similar to Redflex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| which I believe is our Red Light vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Really kind of the point here being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| an issue with enforcement when we're talking about going to a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| as I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| you have to have substantial knowledge of not just the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| but also noise in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Our Red Light vendors at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| actually do that service themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| They will have somebody come go to city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and talk about, hey, this is how the Red Light camera works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| this is how we know that this citation happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and we can provide evidence for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| That does not exist with the noise camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So there could be a gap that we could work with a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| or a different vendor or the actual camera vendor themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| to be able to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| However, that's something that we're going to have to look at in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| not something that we have done up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| We did want to provide some of the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| for what other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| This is just some examples from cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| taking different tactics to approach the noise issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| New York City, which is the only other city in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| that has had the camera as long as we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| it is actually their Department of Environmental Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| that uses the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| It's considered for them really a pollution issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| However, they are licensed to do noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| That's how they got into using the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| They use it to issue violations and citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| so they are ticketing using the camera alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| The violations must appear before the Environmental Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| which it does act as a court that does have a judge who presides over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| And the noise-certified inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| that's another important thing that the state mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| that would be helpful for their people to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| be certified by, I think Rutgers University is what they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Those inspectors have been equipped with knowledge from Rutgers on noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| and can speak to the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| if they are requested by the judges in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| There are cities who have updated their ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| to try to crack down on the issue a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Kansas City has changed it to where it is illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| if a noise is audible from 300 feet or more above 55 decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| from a vehicle between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| There's a 90 decibel limit during daytime hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| so they were really looking at nighttime noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| They were saying, hey, if we can hear you from 300 feet away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| and you're above this pretty low sound threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| then that's going to be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| New Orleans, an example from them is that they have an annual vehicle inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| things like checking things like brake tags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| and that's at a time when they would be able to look at a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| and see if it has a modified muffler or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Fort Lauderdale, Florida, they have just increased their penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| They've said, hey, if you get caught violating our noise ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| we're going to increase this by a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| But really we see that a lot of the cities continue to struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| with these additional tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| They can help in certain cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| but they don't necessarily overcome our challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| We see whether that is the technical ability to get an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| or they are not limited, like we don't have vehicle inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| We face similar issues when it comes to using technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| To be able to do it, we can't increase our penalty above $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| So there are certain tools that they have that we cannot necessarily implement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| although we can certainly look to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| and see that other cities have reacted with ordinance updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| At this time, that ends the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| However, I am happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you all very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| This may just be the first round of questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| If they cost $27,000, how hard are they to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| So if we have one and you say we can move it around, how hard are they to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| And if they're $27,000 all in or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and associations or organizations wanted to purchase some additional ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| to donate to the city, would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I can definitely answer the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| The camera is easy to put up and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| That's something that actually got assembled by our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| They got on a video call with the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| They were able to put it together in a matter of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Deploying it takes between one and three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| I've gone down there and talked with them while they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| They seem to be having a lot of fun with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| So it's not hard to take off and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| The only limitation is it has to be high enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| because it uses 5G service to actually get the data out of the camera and send to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| But as long as you're able to meet the height requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| then it just takes a matter of hours for the engineering team to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| And the reason I was asking about that is it may be easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| but how frequently would we be willing to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| And that's why I ask if we wanted additional ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| could outside charitable folks help increase our supply of cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| so that we could put them in other places downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Yeah, so we do have mechanisms by which we could accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| whether it's a technology donation of the actual hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| or a financial donation to purchase the hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| I think we would have to keep an eye on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| because right now we think this is a sole source provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| If other companies enter the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| we'd have to procure them obviously competitively at that price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| But the bottom line is that we do think that they would be beneficial in some other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| I will say, though, and this is a point that Carter's had a conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| is that you want to be very targeted in looking at commercial corridors, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| places where you're not necessarily looking at a residential scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| but places that are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| We would need some conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We have several places, I'm thinking, commercial corridors downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| I mean, anecdotally, you hear the thing that people know is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| they wave at it and just rev up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| So just having one, they figured out how to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| I know audiences have distinction between speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Do these cameras detect speed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| It is preset to whatever we want to set it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| So if we moved it to a street that had a speed limit above 35 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| we would change the setting to only be triggered by sounds above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| or by vehicle noises above 90 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| Okay, understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Okay, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| What do you think about the nighttime application that one of the cities used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| that you would only use this hours 8 to 6 or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| It looked like that's where most of the noise was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| What do you think about that versus all day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I think at that point it gets back to the enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I think if we were trying to really focus time-wise, enforcement-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| you would absolutely want to look at nighttime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And specifically with this, having the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| we wouldn't just even say nighttime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| We could say, okay, 8 p.m., 2 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| these specific hour windows is what you would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Yeah, at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| So in terms of changing an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| are you kind of referencing the city that has two different ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| Yeah, one of these just had a specific penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| or regulation associated between certain hours you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Did I make that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Kansas City between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| I mean, again, it goes to show that that ordinance would be reflecting of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| that most of these violations are happening at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| I didn't know if you considered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And my other question for now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| were there any other unexpected events like a scream or, I don't know, a bullhorn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| Anything that you thought, well, this is not caused by noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| but it triggered the technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Sure, and this is probably a good time to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| how the algorithm with the camera works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| The vendor that developed the camera is actually originally a software developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| who got into the hardware game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| They developed a wind turbine sound measuring algorithms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| The way the camera works is it very intentionally targets excessive vehicle noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| It has an algorithm in the camera that does not record if it triggers a loud sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| So, say, speaking or music or any other loud sound they can think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| that's not a vehicle noise, it will not pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And I have not seen a single case of it picking up anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| other than an excessive vehicle noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| You do sometimes, I've had to teach the algorithm a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| in terms of weeding out things like loud delivery vehicle engines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| which have their own carve out in the ordinance, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| or like a fire truck going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| I've seen it pick up those before, but you're able to go and click a button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| and say, hey, this isn't actually what we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| and it will learn over time, okay, that's a sound similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| We're not going to record that and just focus on excessive vehicle noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| And last one, you mentioned music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Music from a car, was that considered an event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| No, it is just engine noises at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I was listening on CTV as I got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| so I was able to hear the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| which is still playing on my phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| and had a few questions about what was stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| One thing that really stood out to me is that this is anecdotal information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| you're sharing, and there hasn't really been an in-depth data analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| of these 1,300 violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| Could you give us a better understanding of what type of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| of the data you have conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| So there is, I'll call it hard data analysis, actual numbers and graphs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| for things about the level of violations, what time they're happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| The data that I use for anecdotal is really probably just more from scanning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| through and looking at the different events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| That's more what kind of vehicles there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| The camera doesn't pick up or store specific data around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| okay, this is a pickup truck, this is a sedan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| I can't go in and toggle or pull a report of how many of these events are sedans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| That's just from going through and looking at each event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Usually at the kind of start of each day I'll go through and just look through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| and say, okay, were there a bunch of pickup trucks, were there a bunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| of motorcycles, did I see a bunch of groups going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| have I seen these vehicles before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| If so, I can record that, and that data I can pull whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| or not we've seen a vehicle before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| But the software itself does not distinguish or track what kind of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| or even if it's seen the vehicle before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| That's something that has to be done manually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| So theoretically, yes, we absolutely could go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| and individually record the kind of data that I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| what type of vehicle it is mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| But we have not done that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| And so there's not a database of information that's matching that license plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| and the time of violation with the other data that you're able to view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| once you look at the report, such as the type of vehicle, other information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| I have personally not been recording individual license plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| So no, not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| You could retroactively do that, but I do not have that available for you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| And so as a part of the next steps, one thing that is being proposed is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2218)|
| 0:37:09| moving forward, law enforcement would have access to the data captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| by a noise monitoring camera as well as any data that's been captured up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2235)|
| 0:37:25| I would say that we stopped short of confirming a recommendation in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| We do intend to use the Red Flex example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| That is a software system, and I'll lean on Carter and Ron to describe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| but that's an integrated system that processes that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| issues that ticket, stores that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| We don't have that level of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| We essentially have a hardware, a piece of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| and the example is kind of a software interface that Carter describes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| that currently in order to take any action requires a lot of manual input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| So there's not a database of license plate because, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| that would require an automated process to figure out who has that license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| We're not going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| So if we had an if-if, and this is a big if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| because we are not aware that such a service provider even exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| and if they're out there, we haven't found them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| So I don't want to speak to what that solution would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| but we are not at the point where we could even provide a similar service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| as to what's offered now with the red light cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| And the red light cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| do they currently capture license plate and record license plate data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And do we have policies currently in place with that vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| regarding how long that data can be retained by that vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| Specifically around the red light cameras or the noise camera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| The red light cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I was looking to Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| He says we do, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| That would be part of the operating rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| that the police department would have with the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I cannot tell you exactly what that retention period is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| but that would be part of those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| There was also mention in the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| to station the camera at different locations to collect data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| this new noise camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| How would the locations be determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| That could be determined on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I think there are some that we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Cumberland Avenue comes to mind as one we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Generally responding if we had a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| who live by the commercial corridor asking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| that could be something that we could respond to residents in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Again, we really want to stick to commercial corridors at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| not looking at expanding this into residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| But Cumberland Avenue, I've had folks who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| near the corner of Summit Drive and Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Hey, could we move it a few blocks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| and see if there's a difference there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| There isn't necessarily a criteria for where we would decide to move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| but we do know, again, at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| that we just want to stick to commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| And would you say that the purpose of the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| is to deter noise violations through the issuance of citations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| Again, we're not at that point because we haven't connected those dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| We get the technology limitations that we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| The purpose of the pilot is very much around gathering data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| not only to inform what is going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| and we've heard these complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| but really understanding the nature of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| I think in a world where why are we buying this long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| We've had it for four months. Why do we want it long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| It's because of the ability to establish a baseline data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| We don't know how we could deter action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| if we don't know what the existing situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| In the paradigm that you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| which is we get to, again, a hypothetical future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| wherein this functions similar to a red light camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| absolutely the point first is deterrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| and then to the extent that action is not deterred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| that there is an ability to follow up with a penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| to say you have violated one of our ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| and here is your penalty for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| Essentially what I'm doing is going through questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| that are housed in a surveillance ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| that I plan to bring before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and we have it on a list of upcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| yet to be scheduled workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| but these are questions that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| that should be answered before a technology is deployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| although I do not have concerns about a pilot project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| especially when the equipment is on loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and so there's no cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| but moving forward with purchasing equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| having a third party vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| and not having clear policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| or an understanding of the intended use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| or end goal of the technology worries me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| and that's something that I would like to see in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| before the city would make an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Also, an understanding of our overall surveillance program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| would be helpful so we can have a better sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| of where funding is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and whether we have opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| on whether funding is going to the right place or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| And finally, my question would be around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| how the city plans to engage the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| around some of those issues that were just raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| if a neighborhood may have objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| or may have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| and want either the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| or not want the benefit of this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| How can they engage in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| So, again, I think you're jumping maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| to a hypothetical future that we're not at yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| but to just make two points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| The first is that it is our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| to make attempts to enforce our laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| The second point would be around our specific plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| If we were to acquire more cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| it would, again, really want to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| the focus on commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| and that's a different set of constituents oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| because it's not about the residents who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| It's about the thousands of users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| passing through a corridor every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| So it's very clear that we have an issue with noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| based on the enormous amount of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| that we, the city, and myself, and other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| have received from downtown residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I think that this data clearly substantiates those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| especially looking at the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| I also want to say that whether it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| in the middle of the night disturbing someone's rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| or whether or not it is disturbing someone's meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| or just their enjoyment of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| and walking their dog or their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| these levels of noise are very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| If a person has anxiety or any type of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| as relates to noise, this only exacerbates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| I'd like to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| additional information from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| So New York actually has technology in place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| that they use to issue citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| They use this exact same camera from the same vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| and they are just able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| the way that they have judicially figured it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| they have a way to go through the court process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| using the camera alone as evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| That's not something at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| that we feel like we're able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| but that is something that New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| just in accordance with their different state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| are able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| It's a slightly different court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| that doesn't exist here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| That is a barrier that we have that they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| That's not an automated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So that's not issuing a ticket or a citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| every time a violation is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| That's very much around a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| as we understand it, Carter jumped in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| at this conversation very recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| but targeting around very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| very high excessive noise events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| And out of, again, if we have 1,300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| they've issued around 50 citations total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| in a city the size of New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| So very limited, but able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| really with a human-powered approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| rather than any type of automated approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| They let me know that they are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Erin was right, very selective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| with what they choose to bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| They're certainly not bringing forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| every violation that they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| They're bringing forward less than a fifth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| less than one in every five that they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| It's really, again, those clear-cut ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| where there's no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| not only that the sound is very well above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| their legal limit, which I believe is 76 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| but also that it's very clear which vehicle it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| that there's only one vehicle in the area at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| so they're not misattributing the citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| that they are only bringing forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| the most clear-cut violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| They did not necessarily have an answer at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| whether or not they feel like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| deterring more violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| but I will say that they are expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| their noise camera operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and have moved from a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| to a concrete program at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| So we've had the pilot in place for 162 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| and captured 1,300 events in that span of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| which would, based on some of your research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| in the other cities that are using the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| is that, you know, average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Are we above average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Do we have any comparison as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| what's the traffic count on Gay Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| I'm not sure what the traffic count on Gay Street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| That was a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| We can't really compare to other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| because we're one of two that have the camera, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| There isn't any back data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| in terms of these events at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| That's why I think the camera can be really helpful in itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| is providing some of that back data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| It provides us baselines to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| whether it's being able to issue citations with the camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| if that does end up being able to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| or any other sort of deterrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| or enforcement measures that we put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| whether or not it's helping the issue or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Without the camera, there's no real way to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and so there's not really a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| unless there's some sort of academic study out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| that I haven't seen looking at a specific city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Cities are not really able to track this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| So, as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| we still don't have any concrete way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| to deter the noise downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| I have not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| So one thing we were hoping with the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| is that, in a perfect world, it would be a deterrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Someone would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| oh, I'm not going to create excessive noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| because I see the camera right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Again, we didn't have any back data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| because there wasn't a way to measure that beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I have not, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| seen the amount of violations decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| I also haven't anecdotally heard from residents or business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| that sound has decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| so I don't think that we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| that the camera has been a deterrence itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| But that does mean, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| if there were other, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| if we found other deterrence measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| understanding this isn't the silver bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| there are other things that we might be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| to address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| the camera would help us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| whether or not those things were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| So how would a motorist that maybe has a muffler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| that's out of compliance or other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| that's creating some of these noise issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| how would they even know that there's a camera there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| We have very clear sign posting by the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| that says that excessive vehicle noise is being monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| Okay, I'm trying to think exactly where that sign is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| and would just the average person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| that's downtown making noise, wreaking havoc,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| would even pay attention to a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| I'll jump in here because this is my own anecdotal observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| but I think that part of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| and why enforcement has become so difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| is that this is attention-seeking behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| Oftentimes these modifications are made to be loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| and that's why more systemic approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| we hope, might be actually effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| because the one-offs are not able to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| with that type of trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I would just jump on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| saying that it's very hard to accidentally trigger the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| I mean, we tested the camera before we deployed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| We took it to a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| and we had our fleet department take a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| modify the muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| They did fix it again, don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| But they modified the muffler and drove it by the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| We saw that that worked, and then we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| actually, Russ Jensen, our leader of 301,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| who has a very fancy-looking Mustang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| drove by it, and it did not trigger the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| And that's the kind of vehicle that we might think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| hey, that could potentially be illegally loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| And you could definitely tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| when the illegally modified vehicle drove by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| it was significantly louder than the sports car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| The sports car did not trigger it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| That did not have a modified muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| The modified muffler vehicle did trigger it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I think that from what I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| and from the research that I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| both generally with our camera and our pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| but even more broad, just the research that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| in order to generate above 86 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| you have to be intentionally trying to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I guess my concern here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| and I know that we manpower limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| as it relates to KPD enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| but I think that at this point today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| we're not walking away with any solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| for our downtown residents to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| hey, we've got something that we can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| to help deter people who are down there making the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| and causing them distress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| even if it were someone that could flag a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| and say, hey, there's a noise ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| that you're violating right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| You may not be aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| because I don't think a lot of people are aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| especially kids, younger people who are driving motorcycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| in particular, is what I've experienced downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| making a lot of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| and so I'd really like to see us maybe start looking more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| towards some type of solutioning on that end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| so that at least there's some hope for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| because education is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| And again, even before we start doing a lot of enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I think warnings actually could come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| so I'd like to hear more conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| or let's explore some more options maybe with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| and whomever else is needed or has the capacity to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Councilwoman McKenzie hit on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| This is very frustrating, very frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| and we don't have a solution isn't a good answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| for our residents and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| and people, out-of-town visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| that we want to get tourists to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| and if it is a horrible quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| while you're trying to sleep in your hotel room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| have dinner out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| we've spent a lot of time, energy, and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| to make downtown the heart of this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| and it has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| We can't let it fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I'm not assuming that you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I'm just trying to speak as passionately as I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| that we're working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| isn't going to be satisfactory for much longer to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| so we're going to have to tell KPD cadets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| when they walk around that they need to tell people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| that it's a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| We've got to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| to let people know it's not acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| or it'll be a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| We can't wait for technology is basically what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| is that the technology is not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| so I would just encourage with all the energy I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| that we figure out something in the meantime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| to not just let it look like the city's doing nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| because that's what we're hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and it's very frustrating to pass an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and it's not enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| and people know we have ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| and they're not enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| and that's frustrating to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Yeah, no, I absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Both Councilwoman Fugate and Mackenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| I think that has been our frustration as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| in researching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| so we commit we are not letting up on the gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| to use that analogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| and are continuing to push forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| not only for a long-term systemic option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| but also to explore how do we utilize this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| in a meaningful way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| to provide some short-term enforcement options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| even recognizing that that may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| the more systemic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| that we ultimately hope to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| It's doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Council Member Sain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| So throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| there is an ordinance to not go over 65 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| How have we been enforcing that in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| when people complain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| How have we been handling that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Which ordinance are you referring to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| We passed it a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Decibel level law bans any airborne sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| on public property that is more than 65 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| We passed it a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Is that Chapter 18 or 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| I believe you might be looking at Chapter 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| which is that stationary sound from a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| This is because we're talking about vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| It's our traffic ordinance, which is 86 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| and that's where...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| But how are we enforcing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Like, how do we enforce the 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| I can handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| There are actually two elements to the noise ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| in Chapter 18 of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| The first is an objective element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| That's the noise levels that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| That can be enforced primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| by a police officer with a noise meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| KPD, I don't know how many they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| They do have some noise meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| There are issues with calibration of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| There are much like calibration issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| that you have with breathalyzers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| We have in the code a specific standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| by which you measure from a specific location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| You try to account for ambient noise as best you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| and if the noise is over that particular level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| a citation can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Now, I think obviously the first round of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| is gentle encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| An officer comes up and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| hey, you need to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Many times that takes care of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Going beyond that objective standard, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| the part of Chapter 18 is subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| and there is language in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| that specifically states if noise is unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| under certain conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| then it can be a violation of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| even if it doesn't violate the decibel standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| or notwithstanding the decibel standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| That, of course, requires, since it's subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| requires convincing the city judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| that the noise under the circumstances is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| And there are, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| officers I think often have better tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| to handle those these days than the noise meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| because all of our officers are wearing body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| and those body cameras have a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| It often is a defense raised in situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Well, the noise wasn't coming from my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| It was coming from somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| and I encourage officers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| use the tools that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| If you can stand at a location 100 yards away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| and hear the noise and then walk toward that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| it's pretty easy to tell, or residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| it's pretty easy to tell where the noise is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| when it gets louder as you approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| and maybe when that door opens, it gets really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| So there's that subjective element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| and the objective element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| that you can deal with under the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Okay, so right now it's complaint-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| The first offense or incident is gentle encouragement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| and then citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| You can't issue citations under the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| I would also address a question that came up earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| about sound from motor vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| and particularly stereos, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| sound equipment inside the motor vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| That has a different standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| That is a purely subjective standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| excuse me, purely objective standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| If it can be heard from 50 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| then it's subject to citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| That's both state law and city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| but that's part of Chapter 18 of the code as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Mr. Carter, the events that you noted in this pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| are those violations of state law and of the city ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| There's no way to know if they're modified mufflers or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| just using the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| So the state law only impacts modified mufflers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| There's no state law on noise from an engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| So no, just city ordinances is what we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| are for sure being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| In all likelihood, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| these are probably a significant amount of modified mufflers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| So in that case, those would be violating state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| but at this point we can just know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| that they're violating city law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So I guess basically we know it's a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| of the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| but it's likely a violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| We just don't know because you can't confirm from the camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| whether or not there's a modified muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| And that was kind of my follow-up was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| and I think we've touched on this a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| in discussion this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| but this is not what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| with this noise camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| This is not normal noise from a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| You're having to intentionally change and alter the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| to produce this loud sound that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Generally speaking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I'm sure there probably is a way if you have an engine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| or a muffler that's not modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| but you just have a very loud vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| As mentioned, motorcycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| some of them get up to not illegally loud, but get close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| I'm not an expert enough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| whether or not you could get it to cross that threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| but when you're talking about something above 95, 100 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| I have to imagine that that's going to be illegally modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| Our noise levels are not out of sync across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| and in particular, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| which is the north star to which car manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| design their vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Most vehicles off the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| are not going to violate our noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Again, older vehicles perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| but those vehicles out of the gate off the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| that people are driving downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| are likely to have been modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| due to the fact that manufacturers design their vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| to comply with these laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| There's some systems that you can modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| You can change on the dial inside your car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| the amount of the sound of the exhaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| Is it worth considering redirecting some traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| in some ways, not allowing certain size vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| on Gay Street at certain times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| or even motorcycle traffic at certain times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Is that something worth considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| before a major investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| I would argue a couple points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| I would say that there's been lots of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| that we've heard chatter around ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| even from residents about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| why don't we just close Gay Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| So I think, again, we are not recommending that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| That's not necessarily the type of intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| that we've been studying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| because we've really looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| what are the specific policy decisions made by other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| that would more align with kind of a broad sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| of addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| The other point to make, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| even just in understanding some of the concern from residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| is that this is not even just a Gay Street problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| This is really a problem that we see throughout downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| and so I think that type of intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| may assist in one street if it were to be pursued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| but you would then expect to see similar traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| end up in other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So, again, I think I recognize where you're coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| but would also say that we've seen this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| in other streets, even in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| and so that might be a harder intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| Will there be an additional report coming from this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| In next steps, it says that the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| is to buy the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| so I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| what is the next step from your perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| We are looking at this point into...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Now it's a little bit of a purchasing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| We have to issue an intent to sole source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| is the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| That's saying we believe that this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| is the only one of its kind that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Just making sure that from a procurement law standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| we're on the up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| If, theoretically, we have a bunch of companies coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| and saying, no, we have technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| that can do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| then we would move into a more formal bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| If it does look like it would be a sole source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| then we could go ahead and purchase the camera at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| I think at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| we would likely move it to a different location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and do a similar noise report at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| If we did get to a point in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| where we found potential deterrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| or enforcement mechanisms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| we would probably move it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| to look at doing a second round of reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| to see if those interventions made a difference or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| And this next step is all through your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| or is this talking about working with a third-party vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Our office will be handling the procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| but ultimately, if we, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| going to this hypothetical scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| where there's some type of semi-automated process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| for issuing a citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| that will have to necessarily require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| some type of partnership with the technology vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| that we have not yet identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Once you conduct the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| will it be for your office to manage that technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| or is this now for KPD or a third-party vendor to manage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| I think if we do not have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Until we have a path toward an automatic or semi-automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| let's call it a red-light camera model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| it would very likely remain in the policy shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| If we are to move toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| that type of semi-automated citation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| then it may live ultimately in a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| that has the ability to issue citations, which we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| And there would have to be a change to city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| to authorize that automated enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| just like we had a change to city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| to authorize automated red-light camera enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| So that's something that would have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| And can you tell me how...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I know there's been some new state law passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| regarding unmanned cameras in terms of traffic violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| When we're talking about traffic violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| under these new state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| does any of that govern the red-light cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| or these noise-monitoring devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| The statutes, to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| talk about new or existing or modification to existing systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| regarding automated enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| They're all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| When you're talking about speed cameras or red-light cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| they're all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| That's all unmanned camera enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| So there are rules that apply differently to speed cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| than to red-light cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Ours are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Our red-light cameras, we have no speed cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| The red-light cameras are operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| under those state guidelines as well as the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| so we're where we need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| As far as sound goes, as far as noise goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| those are not inherently motor vehicle moving violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| so you don't have to deal with the issue of moving violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| that we had to deal with legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| when you're talking about red-light camera violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| But still, you've got to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| how can you issue a citation to the proper person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| And it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| You saw the video image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| You can't tell who's driving that vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| that you saw in the image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| It would be even harder to identify the driver of that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| So I would assume, and that's a broad assumption at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| I don't have any authority to say that's the way we would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| if we did it, but I would assume it would be something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| to the red-light camera enforcement system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| if we were to go there where the owner of the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| would be responsible for the misuse of that vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| just like the owner's responsible for the misuse of a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| when it's parked improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| And we set that by ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| That would require a change in the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Just a couple of quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Number one, I may or may not know very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| someone who has one of those little buttons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| to make your car louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| And said individual has informed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| as we were having this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| that the measurement of the noise for that individual's car is 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| And that individual's comment about the Audi in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| in the presentation, that is for sure an aftermarket exhaust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| that would get it to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| So I can put you in contact with said individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| if you do not already know them, Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| You might all know this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Anyway, I don't know why anyone needs a car with a button like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| but it only goes to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| That's the FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Without altering, as you guys saw with Russ and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| Anyway, I do have just to tack on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| number one, if you're looking for a location in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I have one because I had sent it to KPD in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| because someone in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| I've actually had a couple of areas in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| where they've asked for these kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| and I passed them on to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| And, of course, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| it's very frustrating for people in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| because, you know, if they call in to KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| by the time somebody comes, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| So that's the only way to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| And I believe Captain Coker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| had snotterly reached out to the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| and talked to him about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| and they did let him know about this trial that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| because that's the only way to be able to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| So if you're looking for places out in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| I can give you some suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| and that's my only comments at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Just a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Since we're placing dibs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I think the Cumberland is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| and I think that the merchants there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| would probably support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| I'm going to need Mr. Frost to show me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| how to set the sound level on my 2012 Camry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Maybe we can do that after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I didn't know that feature was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| And the last thing was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| what feedback from us would be helpful after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| I think at this point, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| you know, this is the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| of trying to understand this issue better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| and as was mentioned earlier by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| Excuse me, I forgot which council member it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| but we're not necessarily coming to the end of this with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| we have a solution to this issue, we have fixed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| we found our silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| We don't have that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| In the future, that might require some things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| suggested ordinance changes, code changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| At that time, that would be a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| and I think as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| understanding that there might be legislative needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| to help address this issue in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| and understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| At this point, that's kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Other than that, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| always happy to hear from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| who are dealing with the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| if you all hear them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| and feel free to connect them with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| and what I've learned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| Happy to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| Mr. Carter, beyond the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| that we're talking about this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| are you aware of changes to our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| that we could make that assist in enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| in these events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Not at this time, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Is that something that's being reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| I'll give him a little bit more credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| because I think in talking to other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| and as we looked at some of the other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| that have, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| changed the precise language of their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| maybe to Ron's point around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| how is there a more subjective measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| that doesn't require that clear decibel reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| That is something that I think we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| We've already flagged it as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| that we want to maybe think about a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| and whether it might offer us a different type of tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| because it is a subjective measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| rather than that objective measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| which requires, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| a level of technology that we just don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| But I think that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| we'd be interested in exploring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| and again, that would require a council action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So hearing your feedback tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| I think, gives us more assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| that were we to find that type of option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| that you all would be interested in reviewing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and that it would not be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| that you would look unfavorably on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| were we to come with that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| So that is another thing that we'll take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| and continue looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| From the comments that we've heard this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I think that's a safe assumption to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| You know, we talked a little bit about needing an expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| to go along with this particular technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| So, obviously, this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| that you're talking about in the pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| is one tool in a toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| that you're looking at for enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| regarding excessive noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| You know, what would that, if you had an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| what would that expert need to be able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| in a courtroom setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| to help you enforce this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| I can, let me try to jump in on that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| And let me first start with red light cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| because that's the easiest measure of a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| in which this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| With red light cameras, it's all video based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| You don't have that element of sound attached to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| And it's relatively easy to prove a red light violation on video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| You either stop behind the stop line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| when the light is red or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| So, once you have someone who is able to demonstrate in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| that this is how the system operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| and this is a reliable reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| of what happened at that particular intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| at that particular time from a technological standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| and that this video evidence is reliable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| then you get to the question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| is this a violation of the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| And that's where the police officer comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| and makes that judgment and provides that testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| But that's the expert that you need regarding those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Now, when you're talking about noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| you also have to overlay the element of sound on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| So, you're going to have to demonstrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| okay, this is not only how this camera operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| but this is how the noise element of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| is attached to this video that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| or the still photo that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| to demonstrate that it came from this particular vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So, you have to be able to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| from a scientific standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| this is how we measure the sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| this is how we determine it's over this particular level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| and this is also how we isolate the sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| to determine that it's coming from this car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| that you see going by in the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| So, you're going to have to have that overlaid onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| So, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| it would be a substantially more difficult job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| to do that, but it's not necessarily something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| that's out of reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| One of the things that we have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| is that the solution to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| from the standpoint of these cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| is if one of the red light camera vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| actually determines, hey, there's a need for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| You know, there are customers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| for this type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| and they develop that technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| and they develop the system to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| to take that information to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| They have that expert witness available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| like our red light camera vendor has available to us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| and do that because they've already got the system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| as to how this operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| The system meaning the business system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| as to how it operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| and how you get this information to the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| who makes the determination that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| this is a violation of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| and then present that into the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| So if they can solve that technological issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| there may be a market out there elsewhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| Well, and so you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| there's a technology barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| that would need to be breached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| but then you've also got this expert that you need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| and they're just going to need to be familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| with how the camera works, sound in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| and then be able to testify in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| about, you know, when I see this recording from the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| or from this camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| this is telling me that the sound emanates from this vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| and it is above this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| then the police officer can take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| If you can demonstrate to the court that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| this is the technology that you use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| and therefore this image that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| and this sound recording that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| are fair and accurate depictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| of what happened at this particular intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| then you've satisfied that burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| of determining that that evidence is admissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| and it's up to the court to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| whether there's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So I say there's a technological issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I don't think it's insurmountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| but it's something that I'm certainly not qualified to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Well, is the technology issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| is it just that you don't have an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| or is there actually an issue with the technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| I don't think there's an issue with the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| because what we're seeing from the cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| demonstrates that, from what I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| that we can't show with the cameras that there is a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Can we demonstrate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Can we explain that to the satisfaction of court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| that that would be acceptable evidence, I think, is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| So you do certainly have to have that expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| that can testify to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| and can demonstrate that the technology is sufficiently sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| to be able to present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| So it sounds like one next step would be trying to find an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| And that's exactly what we kind of referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| when we think about the New York model, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| or a quest for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| We want to try to find the people who are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| who could bridge that gap for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, have we stated a time frame for the proposed pilot program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| There's no technical end date for the pilot program at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| We are getting started now, pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| with the, as mentioned, intent to sole source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| which is, again, not actually starting the sole sourcing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| but just making sure, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| that we're on the procurement law up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| So you'll just basically kind of see how much data you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| and when you feel comfortable with the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| about making another proposal after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| But there's no specific time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Does the company not want their camera back or a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| I mean, at some point they're not going to let us keep it forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| without buying it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| So while we may not have a timeline, does the company have a timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| If we don't, we're trying to buy that camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| So if we somehow fail in our attempts to buy that camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| they will ask for it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| That was sort of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Do we have, like, 90 days or, I mean, we've had it six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| Yeah, we've had it for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| It exceeded the initial thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| But, again, their phones blew up the minute we put this on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| So I think that they have found some benefit to our demonstration project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| But, yes, if we don't succeed in purchasing this camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| then we will have to send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| I just kind of want our citizens to know this is not a forever open-ended pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| that there will be action within the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| And I think everyone's asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| It's been a very good discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| I think, you know, certainly Mr. Carter has heard about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| and Deputy Mayor Gill has heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| I think all of the council members have also heard about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| not only downtown but, you know, throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| And I know we're concentrating on corridors and you've got this pilot right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| which what this did was confirm there was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| And it showed you when the times were that the issue presents itself mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| And so I think that's really an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| You know, I've got to applaud the thought process of receiving, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4872)|
| 1:21:21| issues that we're hearing from our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| and launching a pilot program to see what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| And I think the second piece to that was what was discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| We now know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| We have a technology that could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| We're in need of an expert and maybe looking at our ordinances for potential changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| that might be able to help enforce these issues because they are quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| And we really need to move forward on that expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| You know, this has been, I think, just a really good workshop for us to have and listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4912)|
| 1:22:00| I really like having the pilot program, having us, and I hope my colleagues feel the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| having us be able to look at that and then start the thinking process of what we do to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| So hopefully we can start moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| Thank you all for participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| And this workshop is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Oh, no, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| We have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| No one signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| So I was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220721?start=4950)|
