| 0:00:00| Ms. Witt, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| Yes, I'm Sherry Witt, Knox County Register of Deeds, 5052 Dovewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:15| As Mr. Arnett said, from the get-go, I guess my question is when was the get-go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=15)|
| 0:00:21| The get-go for me was Monday, when at the 11th hour, an item was added to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| that we had no idea anything was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:30| We did get a memo from the law director, Mr. Jarrett, and in that memo he said that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| had been asked by the mayor and by Mr. Hammond and Mr. Briggs to give a decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:44| That was the first we knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| I had no idea how it would proceed from there, and the whole presentation is what I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| If something is so good, why do we have to hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| Why do you have to sneak it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| It's not where Knox County has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| I'm disappointed, and I have told that to a lot of you commissioners as I've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| I'm very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| I'm not afraid of losing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| I'm not afraid of any kind of base, quite the contrary, but when you can sell a pack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| of potatoes, if you've got open and transparency on the front of it, that's not what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| We're talking about people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| We're talking about the way that this commission is acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| I am not against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| If it, I think all of us are on the same page, we want the best thing for the citizens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| I have a problem that it was not explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| Saturday, thank you so much commissioners for sitting down with the criminal court clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| and myself and explaining some of the questions that I had for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| There's still lots of other questions that haven't been explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| I tried to tell you how I've been running my office, everything I do, and a lot of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| didn't understand that, and I appreciate you coming to the office and understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| Anytime something like this happens, there's unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| We've got to know what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| I don't want to spend any more days in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| I don't want to do anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| I've tried to do exactly what the voters elected me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| Now the first thing that comes down the pike, and somebody says, well you need to hand over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| your money, you need to hand over this and that, and this isn't my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| This is the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I fully understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| You call it my job, my church, because you have interaction with it, but I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| this money belongs to the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| What the discussion here, I'm sorry, I'm very passionate about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| I'm not angry at any of you, you're friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| I like and respect the job you do, and I'm just asking that you do the same for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| All I'm saying is if you can give some time to make a change like this, that's what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| feel like we need to do, however long it is, or what you need to do, the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| I brought my bookkeeper that's been with the Rest of Your Deeds office for 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| There's some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| If you would like to ask anything about any, there's never been any kind of misappropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| in the registrar's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| If there's any questions you have, he's here, and I just thank you for your time and I thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| you for finally sitting down and talking to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| That's where the problem came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| I have been looked at in the media as a rebel, as a thief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| That's some of the nicer things that they've called us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| That is heartbreaking for me when you come to work and you try to do the best you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| every day for Knox County, and you try to save, and these fee offices have been portrayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| That's what I was standing up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I'm not against this resolution if it's the best thing for Knox County and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I think we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Mr. Sherry, before you go, I just didn't want to walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Sherry, I've tried to look at this from, you know, obviously you and I are friends, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| me and the mayor are friends, and me and everybody in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| I don't think I have any enemies in here, I don't think, but what, to me, here's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| fear, I have a small fear of, if this resolution passes, the only thing I see is it takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| you have a two-part budget, and one is through the operations that we approve in the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| budget, the other is salaries that is not approved in the general budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| It's never seen by anybody other than the mayor and the people that file it at the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| The only thing I see this resolution doing is bringing those two together in one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| and, you know, I don't want a commission to tell you, you know, I don't want a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| to tell you who to hire, and I don't want you to have to go through our HR if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| choose to go through our HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| But I think it's fair to the public for them to look in one spot, because you tell your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| budget is only a couple hundred thousand dollars, but in essence your budget is millions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| dollars because of salaries and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| And so I want the people to be able to look at one document and see everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| And I think this resolution does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| I don't see, I don't want this resolution to take an autonomy away from any of the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| Is there any unintended consequence you see now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| I know we've only looked at it a week, but is there anything that's, to me, this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| just brings the two budgets to one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Mr. Andrews, if that's all it does, I would never have said a word about it, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| are trying every way in the world to put everything on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| There's so many things now that people can view just at the click of a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| And I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| But they can't view your salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| And I don't think there's any, I've never questioned your integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| And I've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| But I think that it puts it all in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| And I think we've, you know, 15, 20 years ago the public had no idea of the money flowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| through this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| But today the people are more aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And we've got to do government different than we did 15, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| And I think that if this resolution only does that thing, that one thing, I think it's a good resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| Because I think it needs to protect the autonomy of your office, allow you to hire who you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| pay what you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| But I think those two things need to be in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| And if this does anything other than that, I won't vote for it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| But if it only does that, I have to vote for it, because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| And I think every time I ask a question, of course, it's never been in a setting until Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| And then we didn't have all the answers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| We didn't have an attorney there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| We don't know what all it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| That's the question I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| And that's why I'm asking, if anything, for a little more time to get some of those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| I think that I've heard one thing that it says that, I mean, one of the commissioners said that they wanted us to get rid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| of all these checking accounts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Well, it's my understanding that we have to have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| But maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| I mean, I will stand back and say I have, you know, I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| If we can do this and we can do this without any conflict, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| But I just don't think that those things are clear yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| There's, you know, there were questions that I was asked on Saturday that I couldn't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| So, you know, that being the whole problem, I expected to be extended the professional courtesy to sit down and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:15| Had I been extended that same courtesy as Trustee John Duncan, as County Court Clerk Foster Arnett, I might be on the same page they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| But that's why I'm thinking we are not ready to vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| If you have half as many questions about it as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| Is there any questions you'd like to ask my bookkeeper, Richie Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| You know, I'd like to make a comment because there has been some reference that maybe some commissioners think that there's malfeasance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| or something wrong going on in any of those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I want the public to know that there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| We had an external auditor that came through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| I was attending the audit committee's meetings at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| This isn't our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| This is the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| And they felt that the Office of the Register of the Deeds was about as perfect as any could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| There was nothing wrong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| And in the other offices, there were some problems in some of the other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I know people have thrown the term transparency around a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| And I think it's important to maybe define what we mean by transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| You're absolutely correct if you look at the two parts of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| One part, which is the operating budget, that does come before the mayor and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| And then the other part is the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| In anybody's office, in almost any organization, it's the salaries that take up the majority of the cost of that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| I think that what we mean by transparency is what we mean is making the budget in a form that the public can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| We're a county with a recent census of 432,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| And I'll bet there's not 500 people, and I may be exaggerating, that really understands the salary suit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| We do understand a budget because not only do we have to deal with it with our own businesses and our own offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| we have to deal with it in our own households about what a budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And I think by submitting a budget, it allows the public to understand the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| because this is something that they deal with every day in their own lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| The other point I was going to make is that recently, and it's mostly because of the economic downturn that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| the receipts, for instance, in the Office of the Register of the Deeds and also in the clerk's offices are down very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| And sometimes you may even have to cut personnel or not fill positions that you need because you don't have the money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| And under the present system, you cannot go back to the county and get money sometimes to do your job the way you feel that it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| And it's the same with Joy back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| She may very well receive a lot of criticism when election time comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| because she's only collecting a very small amount of what the courts have assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Now, the problem is not Joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| The problem is that it's the enforcement and the actual collections, either on people that don't have money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| or the judges determine that they're going to forgive some of those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| And so she's having a difficult time filling those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Once we're under a county budget, you know what you're going to have for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| You're not at the whims of the economy or the whims of whether people can pay or not pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| And I think it actually has the potential to make the government run better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| and to make the jobs of those office holders easier because they know that the money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| Then the question comes up, well, what if all of a sudden we're having just a real estate boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| but your budget's been fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| You can do the same thing that Phil Ballard did in the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| He can come back and say, we've got an antiquated computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| We need money that's not in the budget to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| We heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| There were some discussions back and forth about which system to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| He also wanted to hire a person that was highly qualified, uniquely qualified for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| He came back to the county commission, and he could get funds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| If you're on a limited budget with trying to deal with what we sometimes call you've got to eat what you kill with your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| We did the same thing with the sheriff last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| This was off his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| He came in and says, we have right now a unique opportunity to buy some police patrol vehicles that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| at the right price, at the right vehicles that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| We spent several million dollars to address those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| In other words, he didn't have to live within his budget, or he didn't have to try to manage his budget with something unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| The commission recognized that there was a unique opportunity here, and we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So I think in summary that what we're trying to do when we're using the word transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| so you're right, it is a transparent process, but it's a process that people don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| And we're trying to make for the public a process that they do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| If someone's trying to tell you whether to have a checking account that's within your budget or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| or who to hire and fire, that's absolutely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| I think that's going far beyond the authority that the commission would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| because you are an elected officer that is responsible for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| And I don't think that's the intention by any means of what we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| and we don't do it with any of the other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| We can't tell the sheriff who to hire and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| And then the second point I want to make is to reassure the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| that at least in my humble opinion at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| we have a government that we've not seen in my lifetime here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| and they need to have a lot of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| We're just trying to make it more, I'm not going to use the word transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| we're trying to make it more understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| And I think by bringing it into the 21st century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| we may even be making your job easier for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Every time I've talked to a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I've tried to ask them that they just make an informed decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| Obviously, there is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Dr. Briggs, you understand this quite well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| and you understand a lot of probably the repercussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| but I have to say most of the commissioners don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| because I've spoken with them, unless they just haven't shared that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| That's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I need that assurance from you that that's where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| and that if I put this, it's my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| It's not my money, but it's my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| If we do this, what does it mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| That's the things that I would like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| And you were saying when we met Saturday that we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| I said we've only known about it for a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| and you said, well, you've known about it for about five years to get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| We have fought the legalities of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| We have looked at it and said from opinion, from a previous law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| that we could not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| So we never got into exactly what does it do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| And as Commissioner Burrell stated, it appears a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| It might have the same effect, but it does appear a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| I try to keep up with where I wear individual suits too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| so they'll know when it's time to maybe look at the laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I've pulled the card out of the suit pocket that I'm wearing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and September the 1st of 2010, I wore this suit at the installation of county officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| and it's been cleaned twice since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| But the last three times I've had this suit on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| December the 21st, received friends at Minots and Howells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| February the 17th, received friends out on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| and March the 27th, received friends Minots and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| So this must be a funeral suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I notice there are a lot of frowns in today's crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Smile, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| I told you that you looked really sharp today, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| In keeping with the 20-minute sermon I'm about to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| the reverend associate pastor, Robert Lawrence Smith, will be passing the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1011)|
| 0:17:02| I really don't know where to begin with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| because there are so many things that have occurred over the last three years at Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| I'm really at a loss as to where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| We've heard it several times that this has been with us for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| or this was with old commission about putting it on the ballot before the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| so the voters could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| I would offer to you that the citizens of Knox County did collect signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| and placed an article somewhat like this on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| although it was to appoint these fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Now, whether you appoint them or whether you control their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| I view both of those things to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Within the past year, I believe the third occurrence of this being before us happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| and now we're looking at it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| In order for me to look at this over the last seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| what did I say, 168, 169, however many hours this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I had to come up with a few rules of how I wanted to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| in trying to make sure what took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| The rules that I used are if leadership is to be exhibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| the interested people should be working it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| We, speaking now of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| shouldn't beat each other up on something that's only been with us for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| We're talking about the most important change in Knox County since Tennessee became a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Knox County existed before Tennessee was a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| My fourth rule is, the one I have to look back at and grin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| is I don't think I brought this up and I don't believe I'll be able to settle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| I was in this building every day last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| I was in three separate meetings on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I got lots of input yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| People even came by my treadmill this morning while I was trying to get out three and a half miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| and gave me their opinion about fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| It's been the talk of the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| My wife finally said today on our way back from Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| said enough's enough, go vent and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| I found that we have a need for facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Sit down, Sherry, you're bothering me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| It's best illustrated by one trip into the county building one day last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| on my quick trip trying to get from the parking lot to my appointment, I stopped five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| Three of those I'd like to say something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| The first person said, I'll be laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| The second person said, vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I'll get a $5,000 pay equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| The third one that I'd like to say something about is don't fix something that's not broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| The don't fix something that's not broke is the one that I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Knox County is in existence before the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| I say that only to illustrate the fact that change can and does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| Usually change is necessitated by a need and implemented with a measurable goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Knox County is now at 169.5 hours and counting on this monumental change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| Over the weekend, some heard my questions and a couple maybe thought they got an earful of my comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:13| but let me say that I'm very glad to say this is not a county mayor issue versus the fee officer's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:23| It's not a he said, she said situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| I base that on Mayor Burchett being on TV this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| acknowledging that in the 600 or 900 or however many hundred people he has to watch after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| in his segment of county government, he has little time to micromanage all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| Likewise, the elected fee officers and their mouth to my ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| and I believe standing here this morning have said or this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| they'll do whatever it takes to best implement the policy that services Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:07| All the plans or all the paths are legal, they're valid, they're usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| but what I sometimes see is that we're compared to Union County or Blount County or Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:23| Good, bad, or indifferent, whatever legal path is best for us to pursue has been fairly constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:36| is to allow the elected to do their best job or face the electorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Now I want us to look very closely at two facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| First, as we exist today, the operating budget, the rubber bands, the copy paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:58| the building space rent are all currently a part of the county mayor's budget and come through us for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:12| On the second fact, the compensation budget, within 30 days of assuming an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| the elected official must file with the mayor a plan, a compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| It involves the mayor, maybe the director of finance, and especially the official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| and I'm sure in that meeting there has to be give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| If the two elected officials, that's the mayor and the elected official, agree, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| It's filed and ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Now let me restate, that's within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| That's not at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| It's not at the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| It's not in the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| They have 30 days in which to file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Why the rush, you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Well, the official was just elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| There may have been competing views out at the ballot box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| You know that's what elections are about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| That election may have involved dollars, money, head count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| and if that's what was involved, then that elected official has to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| about getting on with providing what they have made as campaign pledges, various campaign pledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:43| This is a mid-budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| They tweak their processes up or down or sideways or whatever it is they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| but they have to stay within the fees that they collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Based on the service they provide, they collect a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| They have to stay within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| They have to continue to manage their part of county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| They only get to hold three months of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| They don't get any tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| To say that we want to take their money into our county budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| which is where it's going anyway as soon as you get through holding the three months of salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:30| doesn't allow that elected official to move their head count up or down mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| This is not really in what I had to say, but let's think for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| The trustee moves his head count up or down through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| Some other offices may have this, that, or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| which impends upon their plan of being fairly constant or flat in their hours per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| Some people are asking, what's the unintended consequence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Does that mean they staff up to whatever they need for the busy months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and have these people there with them during the non-busy months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| That's a far field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Where are we today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| We're looking at that next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| What if the mayor and the elected official disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| I again need to go off on a tangent for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Say you're involved in a traffic accident and the parties can't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Let's say a divorce and the parties can't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| I would take Amy's two kids and they can't agree, but they want to fix each other with a big hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Say it's a property line dispute and you can't get the parties to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Where would you take your disagreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| How would you want it resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Would you want it resolved on the basis of a statement of fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| or would you want it based on a political expediency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Would you want a judicial deliberation based on fact or a political expedience of half-truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| The most important issue is that these elected officials operate their service centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| not profit centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| They are state regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| They do technical and specific functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| And they're usually directed at where they're supposed to spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Send the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Send the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And I guess that alludes to, well, the checking accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Those accounts are checking accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Those accounts are line item entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| It doesn't really matter much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| But you'll notice money is divided up in these offices, a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| and sent to lots of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| The easiest way, though, to subvert their actions is to make their office budgets subject to political wind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| you didn't support Dave Wright in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Therefore, I'll cut your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I'll make you inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I'll make you vulnerable in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| In closing, if there's nothing wrong with where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| I'll go back to something I started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| You've got to have something that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| You've got to have a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| You've got to have something to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And we've got to have a measurable plan in place that will fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| If there's nothing wrong, though, in the elected offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| then let me say this trite word that we've had trotted out in front of us, transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:47| Transparency is not a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| It's a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| We should always strive for greater transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| So without a good plan or measurable goals, we might be looking at a mirage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| Now, while Larry's passing among us, taking up a collection, I think we've rushed at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| I truly and honestly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| But when this is all over and done with, I'll have done what my wife said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| I have vented, and then I can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I want to address this, but I want you commissioners to have the opportunity to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| So Commissioner McKenzie, do you want to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| I know Commissioner Boyles is going to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| That was a long discussion from Commissioner Wright there, so he held true to his sermon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| Twenty minutes, I think, is what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| For the record, I was not invited to Saturday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| No, I don't mean invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| I'm just being tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I don't think I ought to show up to that one anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| But it sounded like it was a great meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Maybe I'll show up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| You know, and I know there's a lot of emotion wrapped around this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| and I think Commissioner Anders tried to distill it, and I think he did a pretty good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| What we're voting on is basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| What we're voting on are things that are five years old in terms of what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| Yeah, there are some other attachments, and you can argue over those other attachments that did not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| but what we were talking about five years ago had to do with this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| So folks say that, hey, this is coming out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| It's not coming out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Maybe this particular resolution was quickly put together, but the issue has been the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| I also like what our trustees said, and that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| We're talking about a budget system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| That's all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| But because we haven't done it in so long, because we've done it a different way for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| there seems to be some hesitation to go in that general direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| But all we're talking about is a budget system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| I really don't think the school board has had any of their power or authority taken away from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| by going through what they go through on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I dare anyone say that the county commission is running the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I dare say that you guys are tying J.J.'s hand up to sheriff's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| You guys are just cutting him every month and tweaking with his budgets and telling him how to spend his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| There's something to say about how we're behaving, how we're acting, what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| What we're doing is we're not meddling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| We're just wanting things to come through us to have an open discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Now, if there's something like 100 vehicles or 65 vehicles, yes, we're going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| So there's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| So I don't want to portray this to say that there's a huge issue that shows up in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| We're not going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| And I don't know who said, and this again clouds the issue, saying that you have too many checking accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| or not enough checking accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| That's malarkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| That won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Someone may bring it up, but I think we'll do a good job of keeping those kinds of conversations at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| Now, if there's a general accounting principle that you're not meeting or following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| I'm not saying that you are, but if there's something like that, yeah, we will bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| But, you know, this isn't complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| That's why I don't think we need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| I actually, you know, kind of like what Commissioner Briggs did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Hey, we've got some slate that I think have spoken to this, and we'll vote on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| and we'll vote on some others that may want to present a little later, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| in maybe an educational, I won't say opposition, but in an educational form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| We can vote on that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| You know, in terms of this being a make-or-break kind of issue, I'm just not seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:32| This is, I mean, if you look at what we're saying, not why we're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| who did it first, who said this about it, who set this in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I think Commissioner Briggs and Hammond set it in motion, and I signed on because it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| It's a good thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| It lets the process be made known to all, not to the mayor, not to a judge, not to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| It just brings those things together, and we have an open budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Commissioner Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| A couple of quick comments I want to make about what Commissioner McKenzie just said is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| and I agree, I think that ultimately this is the best thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| However, and it's a process thing, and the process is, that might be open and transparent when we go in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:33| but the way that we're doing it is not open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| To say that this is simply about a budget system, I can't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| As we've heard today, as we've had this discussion around the table, it's more complicated than simply a budget system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| The references to the sheriff and the school board, and I've heard this point made many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| is that, well, if the sheriff and the school board have to present their budgets and have them voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| well, every department should have to, and I agree with that in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| but what's not said as part of that, that I think it's important for the people of Knox County to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| and for the commissioners to understand is that the sheriff and the school board's budgets are protected by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| We can't go in and cut every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| We can't go in and adjust their budgets up and down however we want to because their budgets are protected by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:29| I also want to comment something that Dr. Briggs said about that this should give these fee offices some relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:43| when things are lean as they are now, if they're not sure they're going to make it from month to month on the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| that doing it this way will make sure that they don't run out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Well, according to an email I got today from CTAS who I've consulted on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| according to state statute, if they run out of money, even under this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| the county's required to pay it whether we have the money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| So that doesn't change. That doesn't fix that. It's already fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| When asked about the extra checking accounts, Commissioner Briggs says, well, it's not going to affect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| and I think Commissioner Hammond had an interview today that said this is going to do away with checking accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| So even the two people making the resolution are not in agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| That's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| Sherry, can I ask you a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| When did Commissioners Briggs and Hammond bring this to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| When did they bring it to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I guess they presented it on Monday. The first time that I spoke with them about this was Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Okay. And the mayor, has he contacted you to speak with you about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Okay. And my concern over the mayor, and when he discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| is because he's been a champion of this and he's been giving public interviews about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| so I do think that makes him involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And, you know, earlier today we passed a resolution on Women's History Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and I know this is not something that you guys are going to be aware of because of differences here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| but, and I'm not at all saying that this is intentional, but this does not look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| The two elected officers who were brought this last, or not this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| but the week before, before the work session, are men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| The three elected officials who were completely left out of the loop on this are all women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| I'm not saying that that was intentional, but I'm saying that that does not look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| And, again, this isn't just about whether this is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| This is about the process that we're going to use when we conduct our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll just emphasize a couple of things and be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| I think it is a fact, as several have spoken to, it is a budget system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| Probably from a purely financial standpoint, I think it's probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| But, of course, we do not make decisions in a vacuum of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| There are political considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| And so I just think it's a mistake, given somewhat of a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| We know that there has been a history with this issue going way back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| but this is not something that's been on anybody's mind that I know of for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| And the details of the considerations that go with it, I am not familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| So, as I said earlier, I just don't see the rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| I think that deliberation is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I think there are several things that could be exposed that need to be exposed in this deliberative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| that could take quite a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| And we're in the middle. I mean, look at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| We're in the middle of a budget cycle and this year talking about a budget item for 2012-2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| So, why not get past this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| We've got enough to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| There's plenty to deal with in this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| So, I just think it's a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I would hope we'd put it off and we'd take it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| I think it's a good issue, but it's just not the appropriate time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| I want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Mr. King, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I see you standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| You're more than welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| And we're talking about the trustee, of course, and the Register of Deeds and the court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| Then we'll talk about the judiciary in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Well, that's sort of one of the things I wanted to do was get clarification on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| Some of my comments are going to relate to all of these officeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| both the three you've mentioned as well as those serving in the capacity of clerks of the various courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| And I want to start by saying probably the easiest thing I could have done was to make the decision not to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:47| or not to come down here and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| And it left me with a thought that sometimes the easiest thing to do is not necessarily the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| And I'm here on my own behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I'm not speaking for any officeholder nor, for that matter, against any officeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| I'm here because I live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| I'm a frequent user of the county services offered up by these various officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| And I have been for a little over 40 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| I frequently appear in front of this body, and I and others like me are somewhat, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| students of what goes on here and how county government functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| And so I'm here to discuss process, political, practical reality, and people's expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:53| And I want to say that one thing for sure that this resolution does, it creates one thing for sure that is not there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2513)|
| 0:42:10| And that is substantial opportunity for abuse that is detrimental to the operation of these county offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:21| If you look at the code, the Tennessee code, Title 8, 820-101, it's been referred to as an arcane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:32| outdated process as to how these salaries are set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| It's been codified in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| It's in the same title of the code that your law director cites for support for you being able to do what is now being suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:50| It doesn't say you should do it, that you have to do it, but you're able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| In that same title, there are provisions for the statutory authority for salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| 820-101 sets out the procedure for filing suit by filing a sworn petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| You have to assert and be able to justify and support the necessity for the deputies and assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| The number required and the salary each should be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| 820-102 says the county mayor is to be made a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| He can respond as he deems appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| If he disagrees with the petition, the court has a hearing and allows, disallows, allows less employees or allows less salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| whatever is appropriate under the facts of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| I suggested that we ought to bring all this together into one budget so we can look one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| I suggest to you it would be a lot easier to find out how much any one of these fee offices pays for salaries for their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:55| than it is to go digging through a county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| If the mayor agrees with this application by the county fee office, he can file a letter of agreement and no hearing is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| If he agrees, they file a letter of agreement and that's pretty much the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| The current practice is to go talk with the mayor when this fee application is made and hopefully work everything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| If there are differences, there's a methodology for resolving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| 8-20-105 says it is the duty of such offices to reduce the number of deputies and assistants when it can be reasonably done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:33| and on motion by the county mayor, the court, upon notice of the officer involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| may have a hearing and may reduce the number of employees or salaries and that can happen at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:48| I heard a comment by one of these officers, recently elected, fine looking young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:57| and he says he inherited a problem in his office and he welcomes the county budget process as a response to his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:08| I would remind this body what it doesn't need to be reminded of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| having something to do or having things approved through the county budget doesn't necessarily cure the kind of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| he has found and discovered in his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| If you think back, if you will, not too long ago to the last county mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| the fact that things went through the county budget didn't seem to solve some of the problems we discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:41| 8-TC8-822-104-A1 requires every one of these officers to keep a complete account of every fee, commission, or charge of every nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:55| and file an itemized statement monthly under oath with the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Also, copies are furnished to county commission and county audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| How much transparency do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I suggest to you the system that's there now is more transparent than what you're going to get if you make this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:20| A2 of 822-104 requires quarterly remittance of all fees and funds, commissions that are received that is due the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:32| in excess of the officer's salary and that of the deputy's to be forwarded quarterly to the county trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:44| That is what is being done and it allows for flexibility in the operation of those offices so as to respond to the needs of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:55| I said there would be an opportunity for abuse and that's because I guess as lawyers many of us turn out to be rather cynical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:06| You look at it on a real world basis, I like to say rather than say I'm cynical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| If for some reason a county mayor had a problem with another county wide office holder, his being in charge of determining the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:25| and the salary of employees in that office I submit is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| You set a course for less independence on the part of these offices and that's the way it was originally designed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:43| an independent service oriented fee based office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:53| Each officer is answerable to the public will through the election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| But this change moves the means for the delivery of service of that office out of his or her control and puts it into a different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:11| It's never a good idea to do that without a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:24| Why are some of these officers in favor of this and some not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| If I were a young officer recently elected and looking forward to the potential of a political career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:39| I can see how I might be tempted to bend and not book the newspapers, the TVs, radios, the Sunday morning talk hosts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:50| when they say use all of the famous buzz words about transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| I can see how it would be easy to say I don't need to get in that fight, I'm looking for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| Well, I'm not young and I'm not looking for a political career, so I'm offering a different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:16| It's suggested at least at one point, and I'm not sure where we are on it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| that this was going to be an action that gets rid of a bunch of bank accounts that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| Wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| State law requires these offices to collect, account for, and remit various funds to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:43| That's required by law. That's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| The resolution you have before you says all fees collected are to be turned over to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| At another point it says all shall be transmitted to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| I think it says that about four different ways, four different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| That's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Each one of these offices has statutorily mandated duties and they're the ones who are most familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| with what's required and what their reporting requirements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| and what the penalty is for them that they have to stand for if it's not done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| I would suggest that most of you, if not all, probably don't know what all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| If you looked at the register of deeds office, the mortgage and transfer tax by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| has to be accounted for on a monthly basis, reports submitted to the state, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| You look at the criminal court clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| By law they collect money for the state, bond forfeitures, fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| Some of that goes to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| They collect some other fines that go to the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Some go to the Department of Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Litigation taxes are paid to the Department of Revenue for the state of Tennessee all on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| That's why those checking accounts are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| That's what they're used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| If you don't believe they are subject to scrutiny and accountability, you don't understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:39| I would urge that this commission should concentrate on the legislative affairs of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| and stay out of trying to run and manage everything in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| There's no compelling, overriding, persistent problem that only this change can cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3113)|
| 0:52:02| and therefore it is absolutely necessary that this be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| Just because you can do something, just because something is legally permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| doesn't mean you have to or that you should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| It's a matter of judgment to recognize the point in time when even though you have the right to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| you elect not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Who knows the most about the operation of these offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Who knows the most about what it takes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Who knows the most about what their statutory duties and requirements are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Who best knows how many people it takes and what kind of expertise they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| I suggest these officers do while I would suggest likewise perhaps the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| nor county commission quite fulfills that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| That's no criticism of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| You've got plenty to say grace over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| And you do a darn good job of it, all things considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Is this public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| No, but I'm giving them some leeway to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| So this is not public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| It is public forum, but you're giving them leeway to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Could you quantify what leeway, because if we're going to extend it, I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. King, how much more time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I want to be respectful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| And I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| And I know the clerk and master wants to be heard on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| And I don't know whether this is the time you all want to hear me or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| but I sort of got the impression that the way things were going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| if I was going to get a chance to speak, that this was probably going to be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| That's the reason I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| But, sir, how much more time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Oh, less than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| Mr. Chair, I mean, I just think we're setting a bad precedent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| If we're going to keep some Brad Mays coming, we keep him to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| And, I mean, I think, again, Mr. King here, he's not here representing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| He's here as a citizen of Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I think that's a little bit excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Regardless what side of the issue you're on, I think you've probably been going 10, 15 minutes is a little excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:27| Mr. King, can you wrap it up in about two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| I'll wrap it up in less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| The point's been made, and it's true, that this is a very significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| substantial change in the way Knotts County government operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| It is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| It is extremely significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| What Knotts County doesn't need is to have this commission standing between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| and trying to referee differences of opinion between county mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| and help some other elected office or officer who has the most knowledge about their particular office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| and how many people and at what salary they will have to perform their statutorily mandated job functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| You don't need to be in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| You aren't currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| You don't have to be in it for it to operate properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and you don't have to do it to achieve transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Mr. King, before you go, can I have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| You talked to us about how we don't have the ability, and I mean most of what you said I tend to agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| but you said we don't have the ability to tell them how to run their office or make decisions for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| but yet on the other side you argue that when MPC makes an argument against your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| you want us to change what the experts in MPC say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| This body legislates those things, and we have the, and I'm, you know, there's problems I have both ways with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| but you can't come down here and argue to us to change MPC zoning rules for you on appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| and then tell us that we can't do statutory things that Tennessee law allows us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| That doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| I didn't say you couldn't do it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| You said we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| In this circumstance, I believe you should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| You should not go against MPC when your clients want us to overrule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| I think we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I mean, we're talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I think we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| You're talking about experts that are making decisions on behalf of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| and one time you want us to overrule them and this time you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| They're making recommendations, and this body, ultimately on a portion of the budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| gets to make recommendations and decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I'm just suggesting to you that what you have here is a situation where somebody is expected to deliver a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:51| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| And you are separating that person's ability to have as much input on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| and the salaries of those people that are necessary to deliver that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| If this body wants to make this change and put itself in that posture of more clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:16| more significantly regulating or managing these offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:25| I think you have to accept the implied, if you will, responsibility on your part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:36| that you're going to make yourself as aware as to the functions and the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| and the responsibilities of those offices as the people who occupy the officer position would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| If you're going to put yourself in that posture, then I think you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| it's almost like an implied representation that you're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| And once again, I think that is asking an awful lot of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Let me, if I could, wrap it up and we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And thank you for your indulgence as a sponsor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I wanted to be clear as to why I'm sponsoring this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| First of all, let me say that last month we were presented on Monday a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| to spend $2.2 million on police cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I did not have that resolution in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| No one came to me and asked me and I didn't get my feathers ruffled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I wanted to see if it was the right thing for the folks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And so I spent the next week looking at it, thinking about it, pondering over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| came to the conclusion it was the right thing to do and voted to get more police cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| But why am I sponsoring this resolution and why am I so in favor of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Two and a half years ago, I became aware of some misdeeds in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| I met with employees late at night, on the phone, outside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| They were telling me things that were going on in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| and let me be very clear, this is not Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| And I'm not suggesting at all that our current office holders are involved in misdeeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I'm telling you what my experience was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| As I met with these individuals and they were telling me what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I became extremely disturbed over the compensation that was being given to employees in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| When I started looking for documentation on what that compensation was, I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| It was not online. It was not readily available. It wasn't anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Because of some courageous employees in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I was able to gather documentation on the compensation for some of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| It's been widely reported. You know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| These folks were being given bonuses, travel allowances, extra compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| The person who was responsible for keeping the books paid themselves not thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| hundreds of thousands of dollars, not over a one-month period, over a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| When we talk about transparency and when we talk about accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| where was the transparency and accountability in that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| The TBI investigation is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| I cannot wait for the TBI to release that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| That's why I keep pushing and pushing. I know what's in it or what could be in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| That's why I keep pushing for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| It's because we as citizens need to understand what happens when you don't have that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Again, let me be clear. I'm not saying that there's anyone doing anything wrong right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| I'm saying this is what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| This is why I don't need 30 days to vote on this. I don't need 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| I'm ready to vote right now because I believe it is in the best interest of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| to put these budgets under the purview of the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| so that when we have the staffing and we have the compensation, it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| It is right before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| If these offices need to come in and get more money, they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| They do it in front of these TV cameras. They do it in front of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| And they don't do it in a back room somewhere and slide money under the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| This is why I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| And I will support it two years ago. I'll support it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I'll support it next year or the next year after that if that's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| So I want to be very clear as to why I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Is it being rushed? I don't think so. It's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| We should have done this two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| But we had a law director who opined and I agreed with him at that time that we shouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| So what I'm saying is I believe that these budgets need to be under the budgetary control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| The salaries, the compensation, all of those things need to be under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| There's no way in my mind it takes anything away from these office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| and their ability to do their jobs or to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Is this the most significant thing in the history of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| Well, I hate to disagree with my folks, but when you look at all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| that we've been through in over 200 years, I wouldn't say it is the most significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I would say it is significant because when you have 97% of your budget under one control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| and you have 3% under another control, or not another, I won't use the word control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| but under another process, why do you have the 3% out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| And particularly when you have these office holders saying I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Ms. Quist has said let's do it. Mr. Duncan has said let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Mr. Arnett has said let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| So let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| They have no issues with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Is this political? I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| Is it practical? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Is this going to give us and the citizens the opportunity to see exactly what's going on in these offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| So with that, I'm ready to vote on portion number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| But Mr. Shouse, you have some comments and then Ms. Boyles will get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| The issue we're about to vote on is simply splitting the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| That's all we're voting on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| No, the resolution, and it was already second, was to split it, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| But now we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| We don't have to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| We haven't voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| No, we're voting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| We're going to vote now on the first part as to whether to include the county clerk, the trustee, and the register of the deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:46| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| I think we need to ask the law director if we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| We're just splitting the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| That was a motion I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| We didn't vote on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| You don't have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| We vote on the motion to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Yeah, I mean, if you're going to, you know, you had a motion to approve a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| You had a substitute motion to essentially modify the resolution before you, which is to only include three officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| Okay, I'll need to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Right, yeah, that's the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| The motion was to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| The vote is to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Not to only vote on the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| It was to vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| That was what was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| The ability to vote on the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Yeah, you were going to bifurcate it so that ultimately you could conceivably have two resolutions before you to vote upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| Right now you're just merely voting as to whether or not you want to consider it instead of one resolution, two separate resolutions, three in one, the rest in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| So this is just to split the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| That's what we're voting on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Not whether to approve the three being under the new, in the new status, just to split the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| The vote we're about to vote on is to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| And then we'll have to vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| That's my understanding of the intent of the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| My understanding, Commissioner Briggs, was that you wanted to only vote on those three first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| And that was your substitute motion, to go ahead and vote on those three first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| No, you've got to vote to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| We've got to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| That's not what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| I don't remember Commissioner Briggs saying his motion was to split them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| His motion was to vote on those three first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| No, my motion was I wanted to split them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| And then after we split them, then vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Well, there is one thing that I want to say because Commissioner Hammond referenced last month's resolution on the sheriff's vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| And that was my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| And that was put on the agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| At the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Was that put on the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| At the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Honestly, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| At the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| But the big difference there was that we're not changing the way an office does business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| And also, that was on a deal that was going to expire that night of the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| This. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| There's no rush to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| This isn't going to make a change by the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| There's no need to do this before the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| That. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| I'm sorry, but I can't. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| I can't go along with that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| I agree wholeheartedly that increasing the understandability of our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| and making this information available to taxpayers is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| And again, what I object to is the way that this commission is doing its business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| This is not appropriate for the kind of commission that this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| Okay, we're ready to vote, and the vote is to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4007)|

| 1:07:19| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4040)|

| 1:07:26| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Commissioner Schaus votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| You want to vote no, or are you not going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Oh, you don't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Okay, votes pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| The vote is 6-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| The vote is 6-4-1, motion passes, they'll be voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| So the first vote is to vote for the Register of Deeds, Trustee, and the Court Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| Clerk, if you would call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| I'm sorry, can I make a substitute motion then that we postpone this for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Well, you're back, you've split it now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Okay, then I would like to make a substitute motion that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Point of information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| We're voting to delay the Register of Deeds, Clerk, and Trustee for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| That's a motion on the floor, substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| On the substitute motion, I support this, what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:40| What Commissioner Briggs and Hammond and McKenzie's resolution is, I think it's a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| to move our county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| I think it helps the public, I think it just helps with the perception, that's a positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| that's a lot more than perception, but it helps with the perception of how our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| is run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| I ask that of a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| In this building, I think, in this building, and let me say also, Saturday morning at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Republican Convention, probably four to one against, but I understand that's people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| work in this building, who work for the people in these offices, or have relatives, or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Out on the street, however, at Kroger, and the bank, and the kids' school, it's running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| 30 to one in favor, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| Mr. King is one of the few people that doesn't have a relative or friend working in one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| the offices, or even he may, but not to my, but wherever he does it, that spoke against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| It's a very complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| I think there's misinformation on both sides, but frankly, when I think of things that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| over the last six or eight or ten months, goodness, how long did we kick Midway and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| Carter School that round?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| We deferred it four, five, six, eight months, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Hilltop, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| Something as small as our, well, I shouldn't say small, but our hotline with the Audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Committee, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| I feel we're doing, we're not being as courteous to our fellow office holders as we possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| should be, and that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| I've heard what Ms. Witt said, and she mentioned it to me Saturday at the meeting, and at Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| High, and frankly, I guess if you were at the meeting, our Sunshine meeting Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| I said, is there, how do you feel about deferral, and there wasn't much, I think Amy was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| it, but most of the other people who spoke to it said, no, let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| But I'm just, I'm really not feeling totally comfortable voting on this right now, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| I'm in favor of it, I will vote, if we vote on it today, I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| If we vote for it in 30 days or 90 days, I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| I didn't vote for it two years ago because the law director said it wasn't good, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| frankly I didn't feel turning it all over to that administration was something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| would be in the best interest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| So I can, I think that's a good motion that Amy just put out there, the 30 days, but let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| me put it, be black and white, I do support this, and I will support it if it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| a vote today or in 30 days, I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| But I think, out of courtesy, not to get beat up by both sides, you gotta do this, you gotta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:38| do that, I mean, if that happens, that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| But I think it's a courtesy that I would like to extend to some of my fellow office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| and others that are asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| So I will vote for Amy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| One of the things that Commissioner Shouse points out is a very valid point, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| you talk to people around the city county building, or you talk to people at some party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| function, I view them as being interested in how county government operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:17| They could be informed, you know, they might know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| And when I'm at the health club, and I get the same response by the way, and then when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| I'm at Kroger's, well I don't shop at Kroger's, I go to the IGA, or Food City, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:36| closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| I get the same comments, a fellow that worked for a telephone company made me pause for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| a moment when all I was there to do was get a chicken and hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:55| I had to talk for two or three minutes with some of the points that I used there a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And with that conversation, I believe that person understood a little bit more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| what's before us, has been before us for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| A budget system is in place, general accounting principles are being adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| The school board is protected, the sheriff is protected, and yes we are being political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| if we want to bring that budget in front of us and have clout over whether that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:38| is effective or ineffective or vulnerable in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| The process by which we get there now is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| The issues of how people are paid and can someone, yes, someone can take the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| and use it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| And I think that's why we have a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| I think that's why we have a new trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| I think that's why we have a new Foster Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| That's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| So what I'm talking about and what I'm trying to convince you of is only what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:23| And how we vote on this, you know, it's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| I just want us to know that I think that what we hear at Food City is what's on radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:41| and TV and in the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| And I don't think that that's fully informing people in Knox County of what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| The systems that are in place that have been overrun in previous elected officials' terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:57| And one other thing, Commissioner Hammond, Mr. Chair, I appreciate your being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| listen at length to everyone's position because I do think this is the most important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| that's happened in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Oh, three years, you said two hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| You said the last two hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| I've been sitting up here trying to keep quiet for however long we've been on this, two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| now, hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| I think we all pretty much agree that it's a good thing going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| But what disturbs me is the contention that is prevalent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4535)|
| 1:15:45| The office fee office holders are feeling persecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| You've heard a couple of them say, well, we need time to assess this situation and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| what do we think it will affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| What are going to be the unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| They've not had time to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| I don't see any big rush in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I think we're going to wind up doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| And I would vote for it probably at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| But I think we deserve, they deserve the right to have the time to vet it out themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| and come before it with any negative thing that they can come up with to help us make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| So I would fully support at least a 30-day deferment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| I'm sorry, I forgot to turn my light out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| I guarantee you I'm silent on this issue from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| You know, I came here today in support of the resolution because I don't think it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| anything but put the budgets together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I don't think it does anything with power, I don't think it does anything with the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| and the ability to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And I was hoping, because I have friends on both sides, that maybe they would show me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| I do support a 30 days, but I mean, if we vote on it, like Mr. Shouse, if we vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| it today, I'm voting yes, but I'm all or nothing, the splitting thing has got to be all or nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| But I do believe we could have handled it better on the front end, I do believe, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| I don't see the loss of, the only thing I see is the budget moving to one process versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| a two-step process, and nobody showed me any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| The only thing we've done is recited law or talked about what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| We're not going to be here in 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| We're trying to make it better, more informed for the next office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| We're not just talking about today, we're talking about a forever, hopefully forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| legacy that we leave, that we changed Knox County government in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| And I don't understand, I'm still, the resolution is so vague, or so, it's not vague, it's narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| into what it does, and I don't see the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| And so, but I'm against splitting them, I think it's all or nothing, and if the 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| goes, today I'll vote for it, if the 30 days goes, I'll probably vote for it again because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I don't see any other loss of their ability to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:24| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Okay, the motion on the floor is to delay for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4705)|

| 1:20:19| May I please ask for a recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| A 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I'll give you the next thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Going back into session, it is 4.34, so clerk, what is the, oh, we had deferred an item from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:51| Commissioner Shouse, and it was with regards to the whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| So we'll let him get back to his seat, and then we'll recognize, I believe Mark Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| is here to answer questions, but I want to recognize Commissioner Shouse to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| So Commissioner, again, Mark, thank you for being here, and Commissioner, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| bringing him down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| This is in response to the Commissioner Burrell's bringing it to our attention that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| some uncertainties and unanswered questions about the hotline, and when people call things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| in, and be they factual or not, they can become, when they go public, it becomes innuendo and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| possibly can be used in campaigns and things of that nature, and who filters the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| Someone calls in about, well, Mark Jones did something, certainly wouldn't be equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| for him to be the guy figuring it out, so we agreed at our workshop for our lunch to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| have Mark come in and speak to it, and Mike, the purchasing experts behind him, if he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| to assist, but just tell us how that data is filtered, if you would, Mark, and answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| any questions from Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| If you want me, I can address, if a report comes in that has my name in it, I can, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| there's four people that have special handling, has a special handling process on their reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| and that would be me, the person I answer to, which is John Troyer, Dean Rice, the Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| of Staff, and Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Any of those complaints does not, they don't come to me anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| I don't see those, and they go to the Audit Committee Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| Joe Carcello gets those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I don't know if that's your only question, but that's how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| Commissioner Brawls, would you want to present any scenarios that would concern you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| how data can be used in campaigns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Thank you so much for inviting Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| I really appreciate that, and Mark, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| I understand who gets the reports, if it's about you or John or Dean or the Mayor, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| my biggest concern is who gets it after an investigation is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:21| At that point, my understanding is that the information becomes a matter of public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| and anyone at that point can take that information and do whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| My example that I gave last month was if the Mayor is running for re-election, his opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| or someone who just really didn't like him could call in every day for three months and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| make some crazy allegation against him that obviously is not true, such as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| I saw the Mayor murder two people and bury them beside the railroad tracks, and every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| day it could be something outlandish and different, but nonetheless they could do that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| these are all anonymous calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| So you investigate it, you realize it's not true, you discharge it, but at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| it becomes public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| Someone who is putting together a campaign mailer could go look at that and say, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| know, Mayor Burchett accused of, you know, 90 instances of whatever or, you know, Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| Burchett has, you know, 300 calls made against him on the whistleblower hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| You know, you can really assassinate someone's character with that, and I said, this is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| for me, but I'm concerned about people, we already have a difficult time convincing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| to run for office, and I think this is going to discourage people even more from either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:56| seeking office or maybe even for running for office again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| So before we put all of this in place, I would really like to have something that spells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:11| out how we're going to keep that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| It does, and again, Mr. Jarrett may want to speak to this, but that is how I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| the law, the way I understand until there's a final report, anything that's being worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| on and investigated is confidential, but once a final report is issued by the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| then it is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| And also we have seen that where reports were supposed to be confidential, they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| leaked to the press during that investigation when they were supposed to be confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| So we've already seen that happen, and the hotline's only been up for what, a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| It started on I think March the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| So I already have concerns because already confidential information has been leaked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| the press, and then I have great concerns about what's going to happen to this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| when it becomes a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| So I just would ask that we not act on this until the Audit Committee can make some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:25| or come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Mr. Law Director, you wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| The Audit Hotline, first of all, we have to realize what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| It's an unfunded state mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| If you have an Audit Committee, you shall have an Audit Hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| State gives us precious little guidance in that aspect, but when you look at the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| models around the state, like the State Department of Revenue uses, it's about the best model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| you can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:51| The problem is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| The Tennessee Code, as it presently reads, does consider audit reports to be confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| while they're still working papers, but the Code, with all specificity, reads that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:10| final reports are public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| So there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Once that audit is completed, that final report is a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| You're talking about a change in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| We cannot do something in our own Audit Committee and then say from now on they're confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| and infinitum because someone could be harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Quite frankly, I think one of the first reports that appeared in the media was that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| employing the Mayor's wife as a ghost employee, who I never did find, but the point is I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| a subject of one of these specious allegations right from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Now that shouldn't have been released, but at the end of a report, it would be public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:55| So the vehicle by which to cure this is not with this body or with the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| We have to have the audit hotline in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| We have to keep the reports confidential until such time a final report is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| That final report does become public record unless we can effect a change in the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| Code 9-3-406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| So, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| Is there any way to keep an investigation open ad infinitum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| Is there anything that says we have to close these investigations at any particular time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Well, I mean, just ethical behavior, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| I mean, good luck trying to convince Dr. Carsella to keep these open, but if you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| you're rather impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| No, I understand you're being facetious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| No, I mean, quite frankly, again, as much as we like to talk about unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| I don't know how far along the state actually looked at this, and I don't know if they realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| that this could lead to possible defamation suits, because we have to distinguish between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| public officials and an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Merely because someone works for government doesn't mean they leave their rights at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| So what you're saying is that if the complaint involves not an elected official, but an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| employee of the county, and this is made public record and is reported on, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| could be sued for defamation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| I could see somebody bringing that suit, and it would be interesting to have to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| But what you're saying is, really, there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| So we may as well go ahead and pass this now, as distasteful as it may be, and perhaps some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| of us need to set up an appointment with Senator Woodson and bring this to her attention and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| see if she may not be able to see if she can address it in the next legislative session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| That's your only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Well, if that's our only option, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| We have no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| We're just asking Mr. Jones for any questions that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| So there's really nothing to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| It's been deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Well, thank you so much, Mark, for coming down here and clearing that up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| We'll see you at the audit meeting also, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| Mr. Hogan, if you would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Mr. Hogan has asked to address this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Mr. Howard Hogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| My name is Howard Hogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| I'm the Knox County Clerk and Master.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| My address is 312 Oak Park Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| I just wanted to let commissioners know, based upon the deferment, that I will appear at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| the April 18th workshop at 2 o'clock to explain to you my office, my duties, my responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:44| and how I am an appointed judicial officer, and how that fits in with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| So I would appreciate the opportunity of addressing you all, answering your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| I've heard some of the questions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I'd like to explain to you how we operate our office and how I may or may not, or should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:08| may or may not, be part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, requesting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| the Knox County State Legislative Delegation inform the Knox County Commission of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| proposed legislation that may affect the legislative and or executive duties, responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| and authority of the Knox County Commission and or the Knox County Mayor in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:49| The reason I put this out was because I was concerned about three of the bills that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| been submitted this legislative session and they had to do with the relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5516)|
| 1:32:05| the commission and the mayor's office and a possible increase in the mayor's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:13| I don't know if any of the other commissioners were informed about those ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I think that we went through this a couple of years ago with, it wasn't a member of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| delegation but it was someone who put some legislation in and we found out about it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| the last minute and there was a mad scramble to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| And again, this is not, there's no weight of anything behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| This is simply a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| It's a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| I did ask to have this added today, however, I had asked the law director to email this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| to every commissioner and also to each member of the legislative delegation at least 48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| hours prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| So it has been given due notice and again, this doesn't change the way anybody does business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| It's only a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| But if anybody, and it doesn't affect this legislative session because all of the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| have been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| So it will not, this request will not go into effect until the next legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| But if anyone wants a 30-day extension, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| So it was just, I was concerned about those bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| One was that the mayor could make appointments without commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| One would change the number of commission votes needed for a veto override from simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| majority plus one to two-thirds, which is actually for us the same number, so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| no change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| And the other would increase the mayor's salary 60 to $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| And I felt like those were things that we should have been informed of or I wish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| we had been informed of prior to their being submitted in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| So that was the reasoning behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I might, I became aware of these from the Tennessee County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| They had called and said that two bills had been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| One was with regards to the veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| The other one was with regards to the, what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| It wasn't about the mayor's salary, but it was about the other one about the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| I immediately contacted the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| They didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| It did not come from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Apparently it came out of Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| And it was a statewide initiative that would not affect just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| But was able to get that through the town of Tennessee, the County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| So they were following the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| One of the issues that we have with our legislature is a couple of years ago we asked them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| do this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| I'd like for Ryan Haynes to come maybe next month and talk with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Well it'll be Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Maybe we can, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| There are issues with them informing us, I mean we're requesting, but there are issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| with them informing us of everything that comes in with regards to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| And so, and there are reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| It's not that they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| So we can go ahead and vote on it today because it is a request, but I think it might be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| to have Ryan or Senator Woodson or someone come in and explain to us why it's not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| easy as we would think that they can just pull up something or as soon as they find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| out about something they just send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Yeah, I'd really, I'm sorry Amy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| I was going to say, can we Skype him and put it right up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| And that way he doesn't have to make a special trip back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| My understanding, in fact, I think it was Commissioner Hammond, this came up when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| were in Washington at the NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| And what I understand from reading the media and from what you had told me was that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| was actually Nicely and Campfield that actually filed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| So what I'm asking for is not that they tell us everything that other people are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| but if they themselves are going to file something or if they, not that they actually, not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:23| that they're thinking about doing, but if they've actually filed something that affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| us like our veto override number or whether we're going to make appointments or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:37| giving the mayor a $60,000 to $80,000 raise when we've got, you know, single parents making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| $27,000 and raising two kids with a deadbeat spouse and they haven't gotten a cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| raised in three years, you know, and they're thinking now that they're going to get laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| You know, that's something really important that I think that we need to be apprised of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| So I would really, I would love to talk to Representative Haynes and to Senator Woodson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| and see what the problems are and see if we can't work out a compromise where we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| some advance notice on this and we're not just surprised by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| The ideal thing would be to have someone in Nashville watching over our interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| but that's another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| That would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| And I guess I was going to kind of address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| We do, I don't want to sound negative, we have the, I forget her name, we're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| We have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| We no longer have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| We have a delegation office that's run by Patsy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| We have a delegation office that's run by Patsy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Seem to be that we, I mean, she may not just be asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| I think that may be a way to get some information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| We're paying for that role and hopefully she can maybe build a relationship with the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| County delegation to do what Commissioner Burroughs is wanting to do because I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| with her and I'll support this whenever we tend to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| But, you know, I think we just need to get all the information that we can and if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| paying someone to give us, to help us and I think that's what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| She's helping organize them and at the same token she's hopefully helping to give us some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| So I just think that's a role that we're not fully utilizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| I wouldn't mind waiting 30 days to hear from Haynes and Woodson and see what we can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| out with Ms. Miller about this if that's what everyone prefers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Well, for one thing, we've got a legislative expert up there at the podium and then I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| to make another, I have another question, a comment, but I will let him speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| What was the question, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| What was this in reference to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| This is in reference to Commissioner Burroughs' resolution requesting that the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| delegation inform us of any legislation that they may file which would have an impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Knox County with regards to either commission or the mayor and commission and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| The example brought up was the bills that Camfield and Nicely have with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| the veto power and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| The other one was about a salary issue that had come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I have no dealings with them whatsoever on the salary issue, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| I know and I didn't say that you did, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I did not say that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| I know that, but I just wanted, if I could finish please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I appreciate you saying that, but I think what everybody's quoting is the headlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| of one of these giveaway newspapers, I believe is where that information is from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| I'm pleased to tell you that they're in error if there's any inference that I have encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| or otherwise helped write or anything to do with that piece of legislation because I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| I don't think that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| I think the question was, this is why I said you're the expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| I wasn't referring to that part, but what I was referring to is what the question came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| up is what's the best way either for your office or the commission to receive information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:13| on what's in front of the state legislature on issues that may concern the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| In the past, you all have actually had a lobbyist down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| They did a very poor job in some instances, in my opinion, because as it turned out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| the state and local committee which I served, it was generally I was your lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| If you remember, there was an issue where there was, in my opinion, they tried to subvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| the will of the voters a couple of years ago and the lobbyist had actually not talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| a single member of the Senate committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| I just happened to be informed by members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| I think Commissioner McKenzie and I had talked about that issue and maybe several others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Maybe even Commissioner Anders and I talked about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| I think you've got to be real careful about hiring a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| You can find one and they'll take your money, but I think you can actually subscribe to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| a service that will allow you to do that for I think it's around $120 a legislative session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| and you can follow that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| Our law director could easily spot the bills that would apply to us, but the big three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| and the big four generally have their lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| There's an association I think you all are a member of that's actually supposed to alert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| you all to those and I'm not sure if they're doing that appropriately or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| But generally this year, if it costs any money whatsoever, if there's any fiscal note or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| physical note, as some of our friends in the rural community say, then it won't go anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Commissioner Briggs, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| That's what I was referring to because I remember in the budget, we had a lobbyist in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| a couple of years ago, but I guess we did away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| I'll tell you who it was, it was Mr. May is who it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| You had one last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| I believe it seemed like the price tag was around $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| I was thinking it was about twice that, or at least it was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| It was Welch and it went down to $30,000 last year, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| Because I believe we canceled it at the tail end because we were still paying them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| a lobbying fee, I believe, up until it was a month-to-month basis and we were still paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| them at the end of the year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| The reason I bring that up is because I asked the lobbyists that we had at that time, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| did this thing slip through, and this is what you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| This was an amendment, one of 22 amendments on something that dealt with commercial truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| drivers licenses or something, and it was actually the newspaper that called me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| that and then we brought it up at the meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| I guess there's ways to follow some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| When they put these amendments on there, it's sort of hidden in the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| I think the actual way that passed was they were huddled up with the county's lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| Some of the Knox County officeholders were huddled up with them out in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| I believe that's how that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| I would be very careful who you get as lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Make sure that they're loyal to you and there is no conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| Actually, I was one of the commissioners who made the trip up to Nashville that day to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| find out what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I know you were instrumental in stopping that and we really did appreciate that and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| I agree, our previous lobbyists I don't think did a very good job for all of us, but since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| you brought it up, does that mean that you're against this legislation that would give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| this raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| As a matter of fact, it depends on how it's written and if it's a legitimate piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| It could be a caption bill, which in Washington, I don't want to bore you all, but in Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| they can have a dog catcher's bill and they always slip their pay raise in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| But in Nashville, a caption bill, it has to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| The caption that the bill is written in addresses that portion of the law, so they can't stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| something on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| I know, Dr. Briggs, you mentioned how they stick things in, but generally they stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| things in with a wink and a nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| You know it, but you usually get a, if it's a whiskey bill that's needed in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| they get a West Tennessee legislature later to carry it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| It's just the way, and you've got to watch, generally, an old legislator told me, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| dead now, but he said you usually vote the person, not the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| You watch certain people when they get up on the floor and you watch their amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| So just to make sure that there's no confusion about this, you are opposed to that legislation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| I certainly want to say that it, unless it brings the, how much we pay some of our superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| down, then that might be an interesting, that's the flip side to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| I don't know how it's written, I haven't seen the bill, I'm not even sure if it's even been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| That's a decision for the school board to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| We have no authority over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| The legislature takes it, then they've taken it, but I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| I wanted to just clarify something along with what Dr. Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| The feeling was Mr. May was the county lobbyist and I called him and he said, look, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| your county lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Chuck Welch is the lobbyist who you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| He said, I'll try to help out a little bit, but Mr. Welch was, I don't think Mr. May received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| any compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| I think they've actually separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| They're not part of the same lobbying firm, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| So, I think that's another thing that was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| He took a lot of the criticism for that incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| That was, I think, the representative from Union County and another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Obviously, it was the status of Mr. Burchett, that time Senator Burchett, by not seconding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| the motion, wasn't it, how it died?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| There never was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| No motion made and he was the one who got it killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| In defense of Mr. May, he has not been a compensated lobbyist for Knox County for at least two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Mr. Chairman, I would suggest, make sure we find out which Knox County members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| delegation are on the state and local committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| That would be, if we could look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Ryan's on state and local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| In the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| In the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| I don't know about the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| We might ought to check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| That might be a good thing to look into for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Notary Public Applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| There's 177.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Did we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Oh, we got two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Did we get Browns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Oh, it's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| We want to talk about the hillside and ridgetop protection plan that we got Commissioner Browns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| Okay, Commissioner, we had talked about this in the Chairman's Luncheon today about when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| we would have a workshop or meeting with City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| I threw out the notion of let's go ahead and have a workshop with County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and if we want to meet with City Council, we can, but we don't, do we really want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| wait until May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| I mean, do we want to go ahead and have some type of workshop so we can start addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| some of the questions that we might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| So Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I just want to put out on the table, I know we traditionally meet on Thursdays, Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| the 22nd is a good Friday, therefore no schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| My family and I are flying out of town about noon on the 21st, so I could not attend one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| on the 21st and that would be the logical time, I assume, because it would be the Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| before our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| I couldn't attend that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| So we're selecting a date now and April 21st is off for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| For me, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| It's the day before Good Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Okay, my only suggestion was somewhere a couple of weeks before our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:10| We're going to need to check and see what rooms might be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| Joe Lee, can we find that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| If we give a couple of dates, can you call PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Okay, if we can get a couple of dates, Joe Lee can find out right now if the room's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I have been encouraged here by my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| He's laughing at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| I was going to pronounce the benediction, but we're not done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| So I'm going to turn that into an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| And I'm not speaking to any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Please take this in the vein in which I offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| Today, I'm not speaking about anything that we've done or the merits of any of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Just after this last moments of conversation from the podium, make this observation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| we the local body are attempting to tell the local officials in the elected fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| And then we've turned around and we've questioned the state legislative body attempting to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:21| us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| And I just view that as being an interesting, somewhat quizzical position that we've chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:32| to place ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Mr. Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| I just wanted to ask that we schedule this as soon as we possibly can due to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:47| that there seems to be a lot of questions and things of that nature out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| that the sooner we can address this and deal with it and get all of the correct information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6593)|
| 1:50:01| out, the better off the community is going to be and the easier time we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:09| debating and deliberating on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| So I would ask that we meet as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| I was just hoping that the commission would offer some help here at selection of a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| I thought the week of the 11th through the 15th would be a suitable week because it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:33| give us a little bit of freedom from this meeting and then give us also a little space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| So I was hoping it would be sometime during that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| What if we do April 13th or 14th early in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| Commissioner Briggs, I know that you have rounds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| My rounds are finished before you all get out of bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| But just so you know also is that on the 14th we have a board meeting with the Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| Corporation at 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| We could do it after that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| What about Wednesday the 13th or Friday the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| We could still do it on the 14th because they'll be finished by 830 or 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| We could do it at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Is there a problem with the 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| Not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| We'd have to see if the room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| I've got a problem with the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Let's go with the 13th as one and what the 15th is two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| Yes, Amy, I mean not Amy, but Julie, could you check with PBA now and see if it's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| the 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Okay, we'll check first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| We'll also check on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| We'll check on the 14th and the 15th afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| I will be here on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| The 13th and 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| We'll do the 13th and 14th and see if we can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| So let's try for the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| That seems to be good for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| If this room is not available, we'll find another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| We could even do it at the chamber if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Not chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| I'm sorry, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| We'll do it either in the small assembly room or we can do it here or in our conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| room somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| We'll find space on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| Anything else, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Jimmy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| So we'll meet in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| We're trying to get into the big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I did have a question or two about format and I know that we need to have at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:30| what we hope to do is have some side-by-side comparisons, what we have now, you know, versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| what the plan would cause to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| And so we've got several things, you know, PowerPoint-type things that we want to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| examples for, some mapping considerations and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| So we need the room to be, you know, we need that to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| And then, of course, we still have a concern about the type of meeting that we had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| where there was a lot, I mean, we're trying to present the plan and the other side is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| trying to present interpretations of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| And so I hope the meeting doesn't, well, I mean, it's whatever the commission wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| but for it to be a public, you know, a public forum, the opposite side to just use their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| time as a public forum to bash the plan, I just don't see it as productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| And so I'm somewhat concerned about the repetition of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| So I understand the sentiment is to do a workshop, which means it would be us asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| This would not be a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| It would not be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| It's more of a workshop for us to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| That's what I hoped it would be, and if there has, if the other side of the issue wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6832)|
| 1:54:01| to do some type of presentation, I mean, that's, I mean, I thought we would just present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| our thing, we would have time to ask questions, and then, of course, we have made the offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| to meet with you all individually, and sometimes that's a good thing, too, because even a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| group setting with 11 fellows asking staffers and task force members questions, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| those get a little bit cumbersome, and you can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part2?start=6869)|
