| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| There are no items on the consent agenda, so we'll move right on to the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| I want to start tonight by expressing my condolences and support for our neighbors in Middle Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| who are dealing with an unprecedented flooding from over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| At least 20 people are known to have been killed in the flooding, and many more are still missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| This is really devastating for that community, and I know all of you join me in sharing our support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| and prayers and thoughts for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| There are ways that we can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| You can donate through several channels, including the Middle Tennessee Community Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| I also want to take a moment to address the dramatic rise in COVID cases in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| We have 1,100 new cases just since last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| 1,100 new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| That means we have 3,650 active cases right now, and this is a number that we haven't topped since January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=314)|
| 0:05:24| when we were in the height of the pandemic, the previous height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| So this is a really frightening increase in COVID in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| and I appreciate everyone who is following the CDC and the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and community's best health practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| We have to work together to fight this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Many of you are aware that some of our highly regarded and most well-known entertainment venues in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| are now putting their own COVID-19 protocols in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| and just this week, UT announced masks must be worn in nearly all indoor spaces on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Again, we ask that masks be worn on all city-owned facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| but we all know that the best way to keep everyone safe is to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| New numbers in Knox County show that only 48% of our population is fully vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Let's all work to try to get those numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| We can do better, and we must do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| I want to just bring to your attention a couple meetings happening later this week that are really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| First, the African American Equity Restoration Task Force, which Council created and supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| is going to have its first meeting 3 p.m. tomorrow at the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=392)|

| 0:07:04| and this is a gathering to explain the funding and application process for the Community Healing Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| This is a fund that was set up by the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| and supported not only with private philanthropic dollars but also by a $50,000 grant from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| as part of our desire to support nonprofits working to combat violence in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| So, again, that's this Thursday, 5.30, at the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=444)|

| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| The Mayor's Maker Council, in partnership with the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center, brings together a community of crafters, local artisans, and small manufacturers to cultivate our region's sustainable, creative community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=706)|

| 0:12:04| One of the most lasting impacts of the council has been through the creation of the Maker Directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| This repository, with over 400 makers, is our community's best gateway to support local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=730)|

| 0:12:48| Just want to thank City Council for your continued support for the new Knoxville Affordable Housing Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| And I appreciate the initial group of leaders who have committed to serve on this committee to provide input for how those funds can best serve on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| I know I saw Danny Johnson here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Anyone else here on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Well, thank you to you, Danny Johnson, for your willingness to serve for the Justice Knox Alliance and all the other stakeholders who've been part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=786)|

| 0:13:27| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| For the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Advisory Committee, I really do appreciate the background information being included in our packet today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=811)|
| 0:13:43| That was very informative, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| One question, though, I believe I had a different thinking behind the advisory committee than what's before us, and there would be more of an emphasis on community representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=826)|
| 0:14:04| rather than individuals who have a background and strong relationships already with the city working on these issues whose perspectives we certainly have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=844)|
| 0:14:19| But it seems my understanding is incorrect on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| I would encourage us to have more community representatives, neighborhood groups, leaders in neighborhoods who can bring forward the creative ideas coming from their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=864)|
| 0:14:39| where they see a lack of housing and potential solutions and potential individuals willing to take the lead on those solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=879)|
| 0:14:51| So I was hoping to see more community representatives on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Deputy Gil, did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| I was just preparing if there was a particular question that Ms. Parker needed answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=906)|

| 0:15:23| 9A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Sections 2-450 and 2-459 of the Knoxville City Code to adjust the City of Knoxville's classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=923)|

| 0:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Oh, Council Member Parker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| I did have a question on this item, and more of a request than a question because I was able to speak briefly with Dr. Drummond before the meeting, and I know that I have not given her enough time to investigate the answer to my question, but I just wanted to make the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=949)|
| 0:16:13| We have approved as a city council a few different measures that have changed job classifications or adopted new job classifications to support KPD's recruitment efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=973)|
| 0:16:29| And I think that as we've seen concerning reports in the news about some of our officers that we are getting an ongoing report if any of those concerning reports involve new recruits who did not go through the same process as some of our other recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=989)|
| 0:16:53| So that was my request that I wanted to make to Dr. Drummond is that at some point we could get an update as a city council of whether we are hearing any concerns regarding the new classifications that we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1013)|
| 0:17:10| Dr. Drummond, could you just identify yourself as Director of Human Resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| Can you respond to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I'm Kelly Drummond, the Director of Human Resources for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| And Council Member Parker indicated this question prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| So what we will be able to do is review the number of lateral transfers that have come in, lateral police officers, to determine if any of those have been members of what she's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1048)|
| 0:17:43| So we'll do a little bit of research to be able to get that information back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you, Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1068)|

| 0:23:30| It is anticipated the construction will be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| in March 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| In all fairness, that's the wet season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| It wouldn't surprise me if it goes a little over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| but it should be substantially complete by that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Right now on phase two of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| we're in the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| The overall project cost on phase two is $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| The environmental documents were approved here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| In fact, on the 19th of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| we are beginning the right of way acquisition process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| which should be completed by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| That's the purpose of this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| And we're projecting that construction will commence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| in spring about the time that phase one is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1453)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you for the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Director Cannon, just for everybody at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| phase one is connecting Western Avenue to Victor Ashe Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1467)|
| 0:24:27| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| From the pedestrian bridge to Victor Ashe Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Okay, and then phase two is connecting which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Phase two will connect Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| to the pedestrian bridge we just referenced in phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Once this is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| and this is a great accomplishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| by this administration and council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| you'll have 16 miles of connected greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1488)|

| 0:25:03| 11D is a resolution authorizing acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| by condemnation, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| of a fee sample interest in certain property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| located at 523 East Oklahoma Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| believed to be owned by Carol K. Hoyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| at an estimated cost of $144,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| as recommended by the Abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1520)|

| 0:25:26| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Oh, we have some people signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| We have some people signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| and then I'll go back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| First is Christine Drummer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Ms. Drummer, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| and start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| and you will have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| to speak to council on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| My name is Christine Doomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I live at 240 East Scott Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| and that is in the Old North Knoxville neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| I have been a resident of that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| for going on 20 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and sadly, during that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| I have had the opportunity to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| what's happened with 523 East Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| It's right down the street from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| That property has been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| the entire time that I have lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| It has just continued to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| The lot is severely overgrown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| and in fact, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| the city, at taxpayer expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| had to remove a very large tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| to prevent it from falling on a neighboring house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and about that same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| another large tree actually fell on the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| leaving a huge hole in the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| that is still there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| That's never been fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| and sadly, in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| the deterioration has gotten to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| where a wall on the second story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| has actually crumbled and fallen onto the porch roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| of the front porch below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| so you can see in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| It's just open to the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| This house is, it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| It has the potential to be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| It's got some incredibly unique architectural elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| that I haven't seen on any other houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| and I know that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| has been working with the city for over 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| trying to get them to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| any further demolition by neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| but sadly, there's not been any improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| made on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| and I would just ask council to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| to approve the resolution to acquire this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| The Homemakers Program is the only opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| that somebody's gonna have to get clear title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| and it is actually, it's gonna take a labor of love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| a lot of time, a great deal of financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| to be able to bring it back to where it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and if it were to be allowed to continue to deteriorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| sadly, all of that historical attributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| that this house has is gonna just wind up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| in a landfill somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| The Homemakers Program is the perfect avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| to make sure that this does not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| and so I would ask council to approve that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Pete Creel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Creel, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| and start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1747)|
| 0:29:18| My name is Pete Creel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| I'm the president of Old North Knoxville Historic District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and I've lived in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| for approximately 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| For 13 years, I lived catty-cornered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| from the property we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| and that length of time, there's been no real effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| to improve the property or try to stabilize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| other than what the city has tried to do a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| and no one has ever lived in the house permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| It's been vacant since the day it was purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| by the Carol, and nobody's ever lived in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| She would go and visit from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| but nothing was done to make improvements inside or out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| during that 25 years I've lived in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| so I think it's essential that we buy the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| and try to save it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| and I know there are a lot of people interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| so I'm sure the city can get their money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Mr. Creel, if you could just state your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| My address now is 509 E. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| The address before that was 700 E. Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| which was catty-cornered from her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Okay, council members, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| I appreciate the speakers who have joined us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| to share their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I'm not really even sure who to ask these questions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| in the city, but just wanted to confirm some details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| It sounds like an absentee homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| someone who does not live at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Becky Wade is nodding her head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| but Ms. Wade, could you come to the podium just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| I think you'd probably be the best person to field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| any of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Becky Wade, Director of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Yes, the property is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| It was obviously the neighbors have testified to that fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| in front of the Better Building Board several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| and they have deemed that it's vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| and obviously blighted as well at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| And has the city heard or been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| with the homeowner at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I have not had any contact with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I know in the past, there have been some contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| from neighborhood codes workers with the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| to no successful end though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| She's made no improvements to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| And of course, KCDC serves as our agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Hopefully we can negotiate a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| if they're able to get a response from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I think it's important to note too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| that all of the required notices regarding the hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| where the owner has an opportunity to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| and present a plan for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| those have been followed by our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| with guidance from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| This has been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Ms. Wade, you've been at the city, how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| 15, I'm going on 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| I've personally met on site previously with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| And so there've been multiple attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| to see if there was corrective action that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| And when, can you tell me when the hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| regarding this property were held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Yes, there was, they're in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Let's see, the determination of blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| by the Better Building Board was done on October 29th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| And the certification of blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| was at the Better Building Board on 4-7-21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| Prior to that, the property was taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| to the Better Building Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| and issued a demolition by neglect order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And that was in March of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| And then again in December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| That would not include any notices about overgrown lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| the dangerous trees, the tree that fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| So that is the process around acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and noticing on that corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| But we could provide a history of all of the dirty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| There's probably seven to 10 a year for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| So if you'd like to see that history, we can get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| I have two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| One is any sort of process like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| being carried out during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| I just, I can't support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| because of the timeline that it's following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| But the other concern that I have is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| the current times that we're living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| require us to take a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| and not continue doing the same things that we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| And in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| when I first began thinking about running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| the way I heard the Homemakers Program described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| was getting blighted buildings back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And we are at a point where we need to create strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| that also address other priorities in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| And affordable housing has to be at the top of that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| When I saw the house, it looked like a beautiful group home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| a beautiful domestic violence shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| These old historic buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| these old historic homes allow for that type of stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| especially in a beautiful neighborhood like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| that's so close to amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| a beautiful opportunity to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| to address some of the larger issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| that we're dealing with in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| And so I hate to see a taking of any sort during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| I absolutely hear what has been shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| about the concerns going back several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| But for me, the timing is unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| and this past year should not be a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| that we are sending out hearings to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| about potentially taking their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| So for those reasons, I'm not able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I saw Council Member Ryder, Council Member-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| You want me to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Okay, Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| and then we'll go to Smith and Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Yeah, the timing of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| if you look in your packet, page 309,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| you'll see dates that go back to 1979, 2007, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2182)|
| 0:36:32| 2012, 2013, there's a long history with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| where we have watched literal walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| and pieces of it collapse and fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| It is a danger to people walking on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| It is a danger to people who live next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| As a neighborhood organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| when I was president of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| we had to ask the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| we had to beg the city to take action on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| hoarded private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I'm gonna go ahead and call it what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| and cut down a tree that was threatening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| to other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| That is not how the taxpayer's dollars should be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| to protect other people from negligent homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| who collect properties and don't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| There have been hearings at better building board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| and public officers hearing going all the way back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| to, I believe, Ms. Wade, there were BBB meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| and POH meetings well before these more recent round ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| in 2019 and 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| That's my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I remember going to them with neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| The taxpayer should not have to keep maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| to keep this from collapsing onto other homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| The taxpayer needs to be paid back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| for what it's put into this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| which is what this action is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Councilwoman Parker, I hear you talking about other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and other needs in the community that I do not disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| that there are needs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| but what we are voting on tonight is acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| of a property that has been collapsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| and collapsing and collapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| And if action is not taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| what's gonna happen is the taxpayer is gonna pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| to go over there with trucks and tractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| put it into the back of a truck and haul it off to the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| It won't be a halfway house, which I have three on my block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| It won't be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| It'll be an empty lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And my neighborhood has begged administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| after administration to save this house from the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| And that's what we're asking is for it to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| through this Homemakers Program, which is the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| to take it to the courts and get a clear title on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| so that it can be then sold for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| or application, which is reviewed by a private committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| So I appreciate the community members who have been trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| to get this property addressed for 10 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| And the time is now, and I asked for my colleagues to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| to save this house from the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| And you know what, here's the deal, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| We might vote on this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| and it still might go to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I mean, we are beyond the point of saving this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Really, it's not going to be a financial decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| It's gonna be a labor of love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| to make this not go to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| And if you don't believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| please come join me on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| It is unbelievable to literally watch walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| of a building fall off and collapse onto other parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| Normal, sane people just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| and call a demo in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| So that's the case that I'm making for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you, Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| This property I've been by multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| and it's sad to watch and it's beautiful what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| And so sometimes these properties in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| move from assets to liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And particularly in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| the Parkway Hotel caught fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| I think it's not an apples to apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| but when neglected properties sit for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| it becomes a risk to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| So the question I had is, maybe for you, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| for those watching at home that don't have the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| can you explain, maybe give us a minute of your history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| about how state law dictates the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| by which an administration can either acquire property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Just talk a little bit about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| by which the city can or cannot acquire, condemn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| remove blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Sure, there has to be a public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| There has to be a public purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| behind the taking of any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| by eminent domain or by condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And the public purpose in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| where there's a blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| clearly is that it presents a danger to adjoining property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| it presents a danger to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| presents a danger to property values all surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| All of that is recognized by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| And therefore, state law authorizes a municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| to acquire property by this fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| For example, we couldn't go out and acquire your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| by condemnation simply because we think it's a good house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| that we could probably sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| You would have to be a judge, a danger in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And this house has been a judge to danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Since at least 2012, there have been orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| entered for rehabilitation of this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| that have simply been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| And so that's why under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| this would be an appropriate action for condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| A couple of my questions were answered by my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| But just a couple of things on the finances of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| On this, first of all, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| about 45 years of being vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| And so back to the legality of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| it sounds like KCDC negotiates or has negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| with the owner or is trying to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I guess what I'm saying, A, is that the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| It is once you all approve that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| What we are asking for is your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| so that we can start that acquisition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| The amount of money that we quoted in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| as the value is from the tax assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| We had the property appraised by an independent appraiser that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| came in less than this value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| And so we have to provide the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| the greater of either the tax assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| or an independent appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| So on that note, on the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| would the back taxes, with the money that's been spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| taking trees down, et cetera, be deducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| from that purchase price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2594)|
| 0:43:14| OK, so all of those fees would then be deducted from these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| City gets paid back from anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| that is deposited in the court if we go that round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| or before any proceeds are paid to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| And then let's say the owner doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| say that they can't find her or family or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| and have that negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| This just continues on in perpetuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Or is that when the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| No, that's when the funds are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| It goes through the acquisition process through the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| The value is deposited in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| And the city then has possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| I just, for public record, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| wanted to make sure that that process was understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=2648)|

| 0:50:01| I live at 8044 Gleason Drive, apartment D7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| That's Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| I came to you guys to express my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| with coronavirus mandates that have been put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| in places like New York, Los Angeles, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| I'm very concerned that these are not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| being very effective, not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I do understand that the pandemic is getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| But in all honesty, it seems like the places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| that have implemented strong mask mandates, vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| mandates, places where vaccines are more prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| have had more prevalent rates of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| And I've also seen that people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| have voted in favor of such measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| have also immediately violated those measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| People such as Sheila Kuhn in Los Angeles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| who voted to outlaw at one point outdoor dining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| and then hours later went back and dined outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| So there are a lot of countries like Gibraltar and Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| that have high vaccination rates that are currently experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| many spikes in coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| As a matter of fact, Gibraltar, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| is 90%, at least 90%, vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| They have had a 2,500 times spike in coronavirus cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| whereas you're seeing some places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| have low vaccination rates, like Sweden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| also are having lower coronavirus rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| There's a video from Dr. Dan Stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| And I can email this to you guys if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| I probably should have prepared it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| But he gave a speech to Mount Vernon School District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| in Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| And he explained in that exactly how these vaccines are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| working, in some ways, not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| to create the variants, but it is, in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| making the coronavirus much more virulent and much more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3117)|
| 0:52:05| essentially, more prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| So I think a better solution to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| would be to make sure that we maintain our freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| as Americans, because that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| our Constitution is set up to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And that will allow each of us to make our own health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| decisions and to be able to fight the virus in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| that we are able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I think we have to remember, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| that there have been many, many vaccine deaths, over 12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| from these three vaccines that have come out so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| And so I think it's perfectly reasonable for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| to be, I guess, unconfident or just not completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| trustworthy in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3166)|
| 0:52:46| And I don't think that anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| should be forced on anybody in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| to participate in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| So if it comes down to having that here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I can tell you that I will not comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| And I'm sure that there are plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| of people around Knoxville who would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| comply with such orders, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| I would actually, in all honesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| rather see you passing anti-discrimination laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Because, again, for the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| can't take these vaccines, who may have health risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| associated with them, it's not reasonable for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| to be excluded from other parts of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| So thank you very much for your time, and I'll be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3212)|
| 0:53:32| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Unless there's an objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210824?start=3218)|
