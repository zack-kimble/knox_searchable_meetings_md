| 0:02:07| an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| First, how long do you want to postpone it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| A couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=131)|

| 0:02:22| We have received the rough draft from MPC, and we will be discussing that tomorrow night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| at our signed task force meeting that everyone's invited to also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=148)|

| 0:02:35| And on May 1st, we're going to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| We'd like for the public to know that the draft is on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| It's under the city council, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Oh, it isn't yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=168)|

| 0:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| And so they'll be able to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| But we will be reviewing this tomorrow evening, and then we have a meeting again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| But we have a public meeting on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| And that, Cindy, tell us where that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| It's at the O'Connor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| It will be in the Mary Star Auditorium at the O'Connor Center on Winona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=187)|

| 0:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| So there's a motion to postpone 12A, which has to do with the sign ordinance, for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=200)|

| 0:03:29| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| We're going to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=213)|

| 0:03:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Well, tonight, for the mayor's report, I want to make sure everybody knows that tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| we will have a press event to announce the centennial celebration that the city is hosting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| It will be tomorrow at 10 a.m. at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I don't want to give away too much, but Knoxville has a very interesting history, and a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| known fact is that Knoxville hosted a conservation exposition back in 1913, so 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| was very important in the beginning of the conservation movement, and here today we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| continue to support that through our greening of Knoxville and our sustainability efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| I will be arriving in 1913 style with Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| On horseback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| But sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| And there will be at least one former mayor attending, somebody that you and I have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| met, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| So come out and see who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Have I got you all interested and curious now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Come on out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| It should be fun, and Jesse Mayshark, our communications manager, has been really, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| was really his idea, he brought that to us, and we thought it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| I mean, Knoxville was really on the map 100 years ago for this event, and so we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| to be on the map again this October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| So we're going to announce it and give you some more details tomorrow at 10 a.m. at Chilhowee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| Park, and it'll be at the Gazebo on the west side of the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| Hope to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Also on Sunday, this coming Sunday, the city with our fire department and the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| EMS Education Association are hosting One Great Day of CPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=328)|

| 0:05:36| It will be held on Market Square from noon until 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| It will feature multiple stations where citizens can learn the proper techniques of CPR, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| I and some of my staff took this course, I don't know, a month or so ago, a couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| ago, and apparently there are some new techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| If you've had CPR a long time ago, there's actually some new techniques that are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| now, so you really need to brush up and learn the latest on CPR methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| We all know it's a great skill to have, and it can really help save a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| If you don't know CPR, please come, or if you need a refresher course, please come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Again, that's this Sunday at Market Square from noon to 5 p.m., and you can kind of come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| in any time during that, and there will be the stations available for you to get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Come and squeeze a loved one or something, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| If you would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Also, we have a couple of Boy Scout troops out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Would all the Boy Scouts please stand up, and their Scoutmasters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| We have Troop 3 and Troop 13, and so I understand you are all working on your citizenship badges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| So we hope that you find this meeting very useful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| This is local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Local government is closest to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| These are all your elected representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=416)|

| 0:07:02| who you are, but we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| And now I'm very excited to talk a little bit about a very special person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| You know, we have a lot of great city employees, and this past week we have one individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| who has particularly shown in how he reacted to a very tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| I'm talking about Elijah Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Last week you may have heard that Elijah, who is a Parks and Rec leader, the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| leader at the Cal Johnson Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I'm having a brain lapse there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| He was helping children cross the street, and if anybody saw the paper or listened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| the TV last week, you know that he helped save the life of a young girl in crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| So that employee is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I'm going to ask Elijah to stand up and come to the podium along with Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| And also with him tonight, I believe, is his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Where's Michaelia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Stand up, Michaelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I met her yesterday at the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| And actually, do you want to stand at the podium there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Because I know you want to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| And I'm going to come down and join you as Joe was given a little more background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Also, I believe your aunt is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Jewel Kaysen, would you like to stand, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| And is your sister here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Oh, hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| This is Misha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| And if you have other family members, feel free or whatever to introduce them in a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| And so I'm going to hand over the mic here to Joe Walsh so he can say a few more words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| I'm really glad to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Mayor, sometimes we disagree about we have an argument about who has the greatest job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| She thinks she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| But I think tonight we can share that role tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| We're both very proud to be here and recognize Elijah for what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Like the mayor was saying, last Thursday on April 11th, some students were walking down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| from Green Magnet, Green Academy, to participate in the Cal Johnson After School Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| And they got to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| And Elijah stands there waiting for them to come across the Hall of Fame, which is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| busy street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| And as a group was crossing the street, he noticed that this car wasn't stopping for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| the pedestrian crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| So he quickly reacted, jumped out there, grabbed a little six-year-old girl who was right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| the middle of the street, pushed her out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| And unfortunately, in the process, the car hit Elijah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I think there's no life-threatening injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| But he did go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| And he is sore still today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| But he did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Certainly an example of a wonderful employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Elijah's been with the Parks and Recreation Department for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| He's a Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| He graduated from Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| 2010 graduate of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| An outstanding employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| In the short period of time he's worked for us, he's really been impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| But nothing more impressive than what he did to put his life on the line like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| So we're very proud for what he's done as both a Parks and Recreation employee and as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| And we're glad to recognize him this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| I am here to present to you the Certificate of Merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| This is the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| By your honor, the Mayor, Madeline Rojero, is pleased to recognize Elijah Clark for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| bravery, dedication, and quick actions on Thursday, April 11th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| As an employee of the City of Knoxville Parks and Recreation Department at the Cal Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Recreation Center, Elijah Clark every day shows thoughtfulness and care for his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| Elijah Clark every day shows thoughtfulness and care for the children in his charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| But in putting himself at risk to protect children from an oncoming vehicle and sustaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| injuries as a result, he demonstrated exceptional courage and selflessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| For his actions, the City of Knoxville is pleased to present to him this Certificate of Merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=662)|

| 0:11:39| Elijah Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Just like to say, uh, thank you to the Mayor and to the whole City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| for having me here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| It's an honor to be honored by the City of Knoxville as my Hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| It's a um, I really appreciate the job that I have with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| I have been working with kids for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Like I said, I just, um, I would like to think anyone else did the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| I got a daughter, have a daughter myself, and I'd like to think anyone else has done the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| in that situation. I'd just like to say thank you to you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=727)|
| 0:12:26| While the Mayor's walking back up there, I meant to say a few things about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| after-school program, trying to give it a plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| After-school program that Elijah works on, we do that at 12 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| recreation centers throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| It's one of the cornerstone programs of our recreation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| We've been doing it for about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| It's a free program to city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| We've had currently 500 children enrolled in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| and we've basically served thousands and thousands of children over the 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| And it's a great resource because we help kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| We keep them active. We do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| But most importantly, we give them a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| someplace to go after elementary school until their parents can come pick them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| because I feel a lot of these children will be going home to an empty house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| if they didn't have this program available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| So people like Elijah and about 30 other employees that work for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| take care of these children every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| and I can't say enough good things about what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Thank you again to Elijah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| We're now on reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| I just wanted to bring to attention the South Fest that was held this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| and it was a great event, well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| The weather was beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| and it was a real collaboration of a lot of folks that came together very quickly, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=815)|
| 0:13:43| to make this a really successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Mayor Burchett was obviously very instrumental in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| But most of all, I want to thank the merchants themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| who did a tremendous amount of work to help themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| You know, during this bridge closure, you know, they're not looking for a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| They're just looking for folks to come and, you know, spend money south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| It's very easy to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=845)|

| 0:19:35| I just want to point out for some of the audience who may not be familiar with this, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| a fairly large item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| But it does refer back in our fiscal information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1182)|

| 0:19:56| and kind of explain to those who are watching on TV or who are here in the audience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| may not understand exactly how this stuff comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| This is part of our ongoing capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Each year we try to fund select paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| The specific paving we try to pave all arterial streets on a 10-year cycle, collector on roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1218)|
| 0:20:27| a 15-year cycle, and residential on a 20-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| And that's to keep our infrastructure in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| And this is what you have here is an amendment to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And occasionally you will see things piggyback where we have paving of other things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| will also be on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| But this is specifically for residential paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| And again, this is the one that was adopted a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| We do have a lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| And that's just because of the cycle because of the way the paving seasons hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| So that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1266)|

| 0:22:45| We have a speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Mr. Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Lynn, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And, as you know, there's up to five minutes per council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| My name is Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community in the City of Knoxville, proudly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| I'm here tonight speaking for my own neighborhood association, but I'm also speaking for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| six or seven more neighborhood associations around the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| And I really want to say two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| First, the one-year plan is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| We urge your adoption of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| This is part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| This is the once-a-year update that the staff does such a good job on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| They've taken it out to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| They've gathered input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It's come through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| It's really a formality, but it's an important formality, so we urge the passage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| The other reason that we're up here today is to present petitions, which I believe every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| one member of council has, from neighborhood groups around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| Now, what kicked this off, first of all, we understand that the one-year plan is firmly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| It cannot be changed except by a referendum citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| So we're not under a misapprehension that anything's going to happen to it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| However, when the MPC staff did neighborhood meetings, on their agenda was an idea to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1452)|
| 0:24:22| the possibility of eliminating the one-year plan as it becomes less necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| We've got other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Surely we could put those in place, and it's redundant, according to the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| We are here tonight to lay the groundwork, I guess, for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| The way this town works, if an idea is floated and no one objects to it, then it becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| well, we're out to see that that hopefully doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| We'd like the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| The one-year plan sets the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Zoning sets the actual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| But the two working together make for a better zoning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| No one says it better than MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| NASA's one-year plan provides protection for your property, your neighborhood, and your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| The one-year plan is based on the land use goals, objectives, and policies found in such documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| as the city's long-range sector plans and the general plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| By tying the zoning laws to a comprehensive planning process, you are assured that all proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| for development and change are examined in the light of the total welfare of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| That's some pretty rosy language, I will admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| But it is also, in practice through the years, it's an important part of our zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| The county doesn't have a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| We could obviously survive without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| The reason that we have one, in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, we started having spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| You'll have a residential neighborhood and then all of a sudden in the middle of it you'll have a little fourplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| that suddenly somehow got zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| This just makes it a little more difficult to come in and do quick spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| We don't want to go back to those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Land development in this county, I guess the perception is whatever you think of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| but for people that are interested in the process, it's not a terrible process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| Development gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Neighborhoods get protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| We really don't want to change that system by getting rid of what we think is a critical component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| You have petitions in front of you from the Alice Bell community, from the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| and Bearden was signed by Forest Heights Homeowner Association officials, Westwood Homeowners officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Historic Sutherland Heights Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| and four officers of Sequoia Hills Kingston Pike Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Community Forum has a petition in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Forest Heights has their own separate petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Fountain City Town Hall, Norwood Homeowners Association, West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| Why are we doing this tonight in the middle of the standard adoption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Because the purpose of the petition is to ask city council to do a resolution expressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| hopefully, their support of the one-year plan and to give guidance to the staff of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| and also neighborhood associations because we are slow folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| We have to work a year in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| If we have to have a citywide organization to protect the one-year plan, we've got to start now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| Again, we appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| We appreciate your vote for the one-year plan, and we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you, Mr. Edmond, and the other neighborhood reps who came with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| So we have Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| I just want to dovetail on what Lynn said here tonight because as someone who came up through the ranks as a neighborhood representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1680)|
| 0:28:09| it was those opportunities to sit down or stand up, as the case may be, in those public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| and look at the maps and look at the potential changes to what was going to happen in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| as that one-year plan that was fashioned that helped you kind of guide the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| to see if there were problems that were coming down the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| or opportunities that might change your neighborhood for the better, your community for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| And it's that kind of planning where the rubber hits the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| It's the kind of planning that shapes the zoning that's coming before this body and before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| And so it is important for the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| and for the people who live in each of these areas to have that chance to be a part of the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| and to shape their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| And so it's an important step, and I appreciate you all taking the time to remind us of how important that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130416?start=1748)|
