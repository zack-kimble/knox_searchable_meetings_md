| 0:18:12| I appreciate you let me go on the ground rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| because we've kind of got to stay at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| In other words, the way I say this is let's speak to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| the way we would like somebody else to speak to our children or our spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| If we'll do that, we're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| If we'll show not necessarily how we act, but how we like other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| to treat our family, that that's that's going to be the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| It's going to treat each other with respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| By the way, we don't interrupt each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Normally, if you'd like, if somebody's saying something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| and we're in kind of this conversation level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| you might want to try to get my attention and we'll follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| But we want to hear what people are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Listen, if you do me a favor, listen respectfully for people's interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| One of the real challenges in an environment like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| is not only looking at what people what people's positions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| but what their interests are that drive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Because those interests are some of the things that we can really use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| to build leverage, and that'll become clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| And the last two, I'm going to be bold and say pretty early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| because you could take this wrong, but I don't want you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| OK, because I don't know you and I don't expect you to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| but I always say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Please don't attack or leverage your position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| for political gain or public posturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| OK, now I know that's a pretty bold thing to say to a bunch of politicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| but here's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| We've got to work on some stuff, and if somebody here's kind of posturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| for votes or position, it's one thing for you to feel strongly about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| I want you to feel as strongly and as passionately as you possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| But let's make sure that's what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| and not a leveraging position, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| And you guys have to decide what that looks like, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| And finally, and this is the hardest thing I'm going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| It is the hardest thing that happens when I work with companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| with families, with organizations or schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| leaving behind past frustrations so we can focus on the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| My guess is a lot of stuff's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Some of it face to face, some of it to other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| some of it back in the back of this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| It's important that we recognize the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| but I want to focus on the current work and the future possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| And if you can help me with that, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| I just need you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And for some of you, I would think most of you this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Anybody in public life, you're kind of used to being Teflon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| you know, people attacking you and it falling off of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| That's what I need you to be able to do that in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| If someone kind of gets upset and says something they shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| or they've talked behind your back and done those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| now's the time to let that stuff fall away, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| Finally, if you could attempt, especially early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| from staying away from what I call hard positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| this is it, I'm this, ain't nothing else you can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Now, I mean, if that's really, really how you feel, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| But sometimes I've noticed in these kind of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| that can get emotional and there's money attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| sometimes people think they're in a much more hard, solid position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| than they really are once we start talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| And if we stake out too much ground too early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| and that's our tendency, by the way, in a competitive negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| You know, I'm going to stake my ground early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| and then you can work me off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| That works buying a car, doesn't work so hot in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| So if you can find a way to talk about your interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| talk about things you'd like to see accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| but in less competitive, ground staking kinds of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| that would help me a lot as we do the negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Is that making sense to you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| And finally, feel free to ask me to clarify something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| feel free if you don't think I'm making the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| feel free if you don't think that I'm acting appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| or I'm taking one side or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| You can say anything you want to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Seriously, you know what, I get to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| I'm not going to take this personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| At the same time, I want you to be respectful of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| like I will be of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| but I want to be completely open in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| And those are kind of the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Do you have any questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| It sounds a lot like what meetings you normally have probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Are there any questions about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| or any concerns you might have about those ground rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| I'd like to see a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| This is just for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Does everybody here kind of agree to those ground rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| when we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Well, tonight, and understand that we have, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| a two-hour block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| but part of that could be for public comment at the end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So tonight, in the next hour and 15 minutes or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| I want to start the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Now, here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| You guys have had these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We've been watching those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| You guys are all over YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| You're stars, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| It's not hard to find you guys talking about this on YouTube| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| if you've figured that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| You've had these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I haven't been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| So tonight may feel a little repetitive to some of you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Some of you may be thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Does this guy not know this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| But tonight, we're going to work on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| We need to establish a process of how we make decisions tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| and how we plan to move forward by September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| I am not guaranteeing you September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| everybody's fat, dumb, and happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I mean, you know how that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| But I am committed by September 1 of moving us down the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| to where you are in a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| you feel like you can make some good decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| perhaps put closure to this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| But to do that, we have to have a night of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and listening and talking, and that's tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| The subsequent three meetings, you know, every other week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| those are where we're going to get more into the meat of the disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| the more of the meat of where we stand and how we resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| But if we don't have the process meeting on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| those become difficult to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Does that make sense to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| Steve, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1517)|
| 0:25:17| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Talking about process in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| given we've got fairly poor attendance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| how will we handle the lack of participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Yeah, that's a concern of mine also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| but I plan to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| We're taking extensive and copious notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| and I think this is also available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| will probably be available on YouTube and other arenas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I'm going to contact each one of the council and commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| who aren't here and ask them to watch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| and I'll send them notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| and I'm going to contact them individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| to go through that same process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Because we really do need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| what would be difficult on us is for somebody to drop in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| two meetings into the process and have a different agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| So it does put somewhat of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Tony, it puts a little more burden on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| to make sure that everybody who's not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| gets that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| But that's part of my job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| and I'll just have to make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| It would be easier if everybody was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Other people have other things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| So I appreciate that, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| We'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Now, what I understand, and this is my summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| we've, me and my staff have kind of read through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| what I understand has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| is that the council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| appointed by joint resolution, a subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| to develop recommendations to address the ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| and side mountain development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| My understanding of this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| was produced by the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and I believe Tony and Joe Hulsquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| chaired that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| It was brought then to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| You guys had public comment, held hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| and then you voted six to five not to adopt the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Am I still on target with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| That's the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| The city hasn't acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I'm sorry, the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| The city chose not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| The city chose not to vote on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| See, my left and right's getting me here, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| I'm gonna have to remember who I'm talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| The city chose not to vote on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| and chose to table the vote on the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| And there was some discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| do we appoint a new subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Do we bring in more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| And we had discussions along that arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| of what we should do to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| to find ways to build bridges on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And finally, as my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| you guys decided to bring in a third party facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| to discuss accepting, amending, or ignoring the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| Is that, does that seem fairly accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| of the summary of where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| The council did not table the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| That's a very different action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| We postponed action for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| The 60 days will be up at the meeting this coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| It will come before council for first reading at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| And so you guys, as of this next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| the document comes back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Okay, that's good information for me to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| What I'm, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Yeah, this is Richard Briggs over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I wanted to make a comment just to clarify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| is what we're mediating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I think that some people may have the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| that this is a disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| between the county commission and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And I don't think that's really what we're mediating against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I don't think there's opposing sides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| I think really what needs mediating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| is the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| and I'll try not to use any loaded terms here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| because we've done that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| either say you're a developer or you're environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Let's say the pro-plan people as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| and the people that were against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| And the people that were against the plan were in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| and I'll be leaving some people out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| but they were the developers and landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| who were dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| leaning on my button here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1770)|
| 0:29:30| land issue rights and development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| And at least what I would envision this being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| is not trying to be some sort of a mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| between the city council and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| but it really is trying to mediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| between the people that were against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and the people that were for the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| which really are going to be your developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| and your landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Dealing with land rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| You know, versus those that wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| to put certain restrictions on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| And just to give you a little additional background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| is that I know Tony and Joe had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| what was there, 12 community meetings that we had, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| 12 or 13 community meetings in the different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| And I think it would be fair to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| for the most part, not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| because some of them did become very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| again, I'm trying to avoid a loaded term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| some of them were debated very ardently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| But anyway, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| they were very poorly attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| and I think it would be very fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| is that some of the people that were opposed to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| just weren't at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| because they just pretty much ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And it wasn't until we actually had a plan there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| that all of a sudden people came out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| you know, I don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| And at least what I would see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| what we're going to have to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| is to take some of the people that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| or some of the factions that were against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| and try to find out, at a limited amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| what they didn't like about the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| and see if there's any compromises that can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| But I don't think it was a conflict or name calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| between the city council and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| It's more between the pro plan and the anti-plan people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| And just to put something else on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| because it may leave the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| that many of us on the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| were against the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| there was a stipulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| and this is just the way the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| or whatever the ordinances were written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| is that we, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| could make no modifications on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| It had to be voted up or down in the fashion it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| And I believe that some of us voted it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| simply because we wanted to make some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| that may not even be very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1900)|
| 0:31:40| But also to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| even though they'd had the opportunity previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| but to give some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| that may have had some legitimate issues with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| the chance to modify those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| to see if that would be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| to the rest of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| And I think that's really where the mediation needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| rather than there's a side over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| and there's a side over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| It's really between here and the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and people out there that may have had opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| to certain aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I think it's really articulate and right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I understand that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I understand, it was made clear to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| that the commission was understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| that the only way to amend that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| from their understanding was to either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| vote it up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| then make amendment and to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| You could even tell by the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| that there's no monolith either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| I plan to spend a significant amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| with the stakeholders in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| over the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| because I understand that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| My conversations in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| are gonna be primarily with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| because you're the voting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Because no matter what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| it still comes back to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| But I do not want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| and I appreciate the clarification, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| because I don't want to leave the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| the council wants to go one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| and the county wants to go the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Because that is not my understanding at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| And I thank you for helping me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| What I would love to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| to start the conversation tonight then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| is not so much rehash how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| I think I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I think all of you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| But what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| is just ask, why is this so important to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Why is it important to you individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| You know, there's a lot of things you could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| There's a lot of things you could be spending time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| and yet you devoted four workshops just to this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| So apparently, to some of you, if not all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| this is an important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| And what I need to know on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| is why it's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And the way I'd like to begin this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| I think I'm gonna start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| since you guys have voted on it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I'd like to start with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| and take about 10 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| And I don't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| if you want to tell me about history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| that helps clarify, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| I don't necessarily want you to tell me so much facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| we'll talk about that later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| but why this is important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And why this drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| And Mike, I'm gonna let you close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| You'll be the last comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| if that's all right with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| But I'd like to hear from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Why is this so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| By the way, I got a therapy background too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| so I could like stare at you for 20 minutes and be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| I thought you were just gonna go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| No, I'm gonna let you guys volunteer here, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Why is it important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Well, as the old saying goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| they ain't making no more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And we have to be good stewards of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| I have, for the last 39 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| been an advocate in my community for good land usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| I'm not anti-development, but I'm for proper development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| And I think this is a good instance here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| where that we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| to put some rules and regulations in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| that can help things down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| We have to plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| We have things brought before us on a continuing basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and I'm sure that the city council has too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| where that development was slapshod, roughshod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| you know, wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| And now we're paying the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| We cannot take care of all of the water runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| we have right now because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| largely because of poor practices in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| But a proper document in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| that will help control some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| you know, we're looking at our grandkids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| you know, what they're gonna have to be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2137)|
| 0:35:37| And I think it's overall kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| We're trying to plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| And I hear you saying it's kind of a legacy issue for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Is that fair that you want to leave something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| for your grandkids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:49| Is that kind of what I heard you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I think all of us feel that way to a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| But I mean, personally, I'm just telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| that that's where I've been for the last 39 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and working for the community in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| So it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| And I hear you say that you felt like perhaps in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| we've not managed it as well as we could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| and we've gotten in this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| If you look at the history of the growth of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| how that it blasted out of the chute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| and down Kingston Pike West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| in a lot of cases with poor development practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| it's causing a lot of problems down there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| And I don't want to see that happen in future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I think we have to look at what we can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Somebody comes up and says, what's my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I can do whatever I want with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Sure you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| as long as it doesn't adversely affect someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| And that's where these bodies have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| to try to put rules and regs in place that'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So I kind of hear you, Mike, saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| it's my legacy, it's my grandkids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| it's what we leave people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And I hear you also saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| I don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| so correct me, because I want to be accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| that as this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| you feel you have opportunity to help correct some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| so that we can still develop, but in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Is that right on target?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2239)|
| 0:37:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Somebody else hop in with, yeah, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| It's important to me because it's so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| to all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| And I realized that after we got into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| and it came up on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I went to some of the meetings Tony and Joe had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| four or five of them around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Some of them were fairly well attended, many were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| but there was a couple of very vocal people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| that attended all of them, one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| and it was Tony had to have security called in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| and so forth a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Well, I won't get into the dispute he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| with the county commission, that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| But as it, and I thought at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| I don't know when those were, say a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| I thought, well, this will move right through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| the county commission and we will adopt these land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| You can drive around our city as you cross the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| coming in from Nashville to Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| to Knox County line, you look up on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| you can see how a hill's been just massacred out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And we're debating whether to, a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| a gentleman wants to correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and drive all over Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| you can see runoff and where the water-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| That kind of 40 coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| 40, yeah, I'm coming in from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| As you're leaving Watt Road, look up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and you'll see how not to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| although it is hopefully going to get resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Lots of other examples around town of water runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| and we get calls all the time after every big rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| development up here, people live here and they flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Water flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Water flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| But-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2334)|
| 0:38:54| Building collapses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Yeah, building collapses and we have a storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| department who's overworked, but after we got into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| and it came to a head, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| or once more public focus, public attention focused on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| as it was mentioned, the other side of the story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| started to be told and mistold and misinterpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| and so forth, and interpreted, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| by people who would be more in the development side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| so to speak, or more, as was mentioned by Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| the property owner side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| And I heard from dozens of people when this vote came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| they said, look, that property's been in my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| for 100 years or 50 years or a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| and we want to be able to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| And so we heard that old, don't tread on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| it's my property, I'll do what I want to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| That was an element of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| The development and people, the people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| not just developers, the people who sell two-by-fours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| and sheet rock and plywood and cement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| the building industry said, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| look how hard it is to build right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| We're at 10% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| This would make it even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| What are you trying to do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| We're in the worst economy in 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| so look what you're trying to do to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| So that dichotomy sort of arose and presented itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| And as always, we were in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Do we vote to, do we vote this through or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| And so that's sort of the dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| that we found ourself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| And for you, so it comes back to you at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| With all that stuff has gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| for you specifically, why is this so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Oh, I mean, it's important because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| I want to protect our environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| and protect this beautiful place we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| But I also do not want to prohibit commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| I don't want to have people laid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and not have jobs and not have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| to do something with their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| that they plan to do for a hundred year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| or the family's plan to do for a hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And I was, we were in the catch 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| if that's the right term, again, that Dr. Briggs mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I hate to throw the whole baby out with the bathwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| but that's what we were told, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| it's an up or down, it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| It just needs some tweaking, particularly the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| In my opinion, the ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| certainly needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| So that has been, those things have been abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| There's one a half a mile from my house up above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| and it's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| I would like to live on a ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| but it's certainly, it's so detrimental to our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| But that's in a minute and 30 second nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| the dilemma that I found myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| So what I hear you saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| you want to protect the environment, develop business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| and you're feeling caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| I mean, is that what I hear you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Well, sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| I mean, that's what we're elected and paid to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| is to be caught and make the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| And this is one that, you know, we have sort of made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| but we hopefully will be making again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| in a more positive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2529)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Somebody else real quick to hop in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| and kind of tell me what's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I'll just real quickly say something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And I don't want to repeat everything that they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| because I agree with them completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| And, you know, we've got to do things to protect the runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| because it's caused a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| We can't have these disastrous landslides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| We actually had a colleague of mine that worked at Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| who got caught in one of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| and lost both of his legs in his apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| That can't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| To me, the gray areas are the green areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| And that's where we're not harming other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| We're not runoff issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| There's just the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| should we just leave something green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| for the sake of being green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I think that's the debatable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| But, you know, I think there's a bigger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| that goes beyond just this slopes and hilltop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| in that the atmosphere here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| had become very hostile and poisoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| And as we go forward in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| if we really want to accomplish what I think everyone does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| which is to have responsible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| but yet protect the treasures that we're the stewards of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| we're going to have to have cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| between both the developmental, the property rights people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| and also those that want to protect all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| And the atmosphere had become so poisoned with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| that there was no way that it was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| to continue in a positive faction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And we've had that on other issues here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| We recently had our budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| that got very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| We've had it on how we're going to deal with the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| And I think if we can resolve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| the way that I would hope we can resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| in the end, maybe everybody doesn't get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| But both sides, we've done all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| what everyone really wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| even the responsible developers don't want these disasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| But we have to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| that we're satisfying all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| that everyone wants and do it in a cooperative manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| because otherwise it's not going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| if it becomes confrontational and hostile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| And what I hear you saying is that there's just been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| a pattern of hostility starting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It seems pretty competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| It had gotten pretty hostile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And I think if we would have either passed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| or there'd have been a lot of bad feelings there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| if we would have accepted it without people feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| that they had their fair say, it was just, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| it was just not going to go in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| and accomplish what we really want to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| And did I hear you saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I don't want to put words in your mouth, Doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| but did I hear you say maybe this could be a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| for how we treat each other down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Or maybe a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I'm not sure we've always done things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| We've had problems dealing with the homeless situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| here, what to do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| how we're going to allocate our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| We probably need to go, just when we approach problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| maybe then rather doing it the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| after there's things have all sort of fallen apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| is doing it the right way to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| And it does seem that we've developed in our cultures a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| you can do here, you can go Northeast to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| We've developed a fairly competitive culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| right now, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| And so it'll be fabulous if we can find a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| for discussion, find a way to deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| that would have a bigger impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| And I tell you, part of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| it's just like Pogo said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| we've seen the enemy and he is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| And there was an effort to make this an inclusive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Apathy is probably the root here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| as we had all these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| not some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| that should have been settled back then weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| it wasn't until the final plan was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| And then a lot of the opposition came up to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| and we were put in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| where we had to either vote it up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| and we couldn't make the changes at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| when the opportunity was there to make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| there was silence and apathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And so now we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| And now we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Okay, I'll let you speak back in, Mike, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I think that you could safely say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| that 75% of the controversy over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| was caused by the spreading of misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| Okay, so you perceive, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| About what was in the plan and what it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Whether you're pro or anti,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| this group picked up one thing they didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| and they made a martyr out of that one particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| So misinformation was the cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| of 75% of the problems in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| It's hard to believe that people disseminate misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| to get their way in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| It's just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| But I don't mean to make a lot of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| And it is in every kind of public debate I've ever been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| that is a common theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| And I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| and I don't wanna go too far afield right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| but I don't know if it's sometimes people do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| out of a desire to manipulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Other times people do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| because they just don't have all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| or they jump to conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Those things go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| And we understand that and I appreciate that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Real quick, going back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2829)|
| 0:47:09| I think we have Dave and Tony left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Dave, why is this important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| That's the question I wanna ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| The most important thing about it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| is it's been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| Over and over, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| when I go to public meetings or the Ruatan Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| or the senior citizens or wherever I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| the first words I want to make sure I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| is that I need to know how you feel about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Because I view it as my task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| the district that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| it's not my idea that's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| It's how people feel about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| That's what I'll support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| In this particular subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| it's just the way it's turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I hope that I can do that every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| something comes up to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| It's not what I wanna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| It's what I think I've collected the data on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| that people would like to see the end result of my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| So what I hear you saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| what's really important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| is you adequately represent the desires of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| As all these folks know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| this is the issue of hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| and probably water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| have been an issue for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| sort of a lifelong professional interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| from my years as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| And so strangely enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| I had the opportunity to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| And so from a legislative standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| it's something to me I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| is should have been addressed a hundred years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| and was actually in some documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| about how we're to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| And what do we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| What is our vision for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| This hilly place where we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| people long ago noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| that we need to be concerned about what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| And so I see it's hugely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| from an economic standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| and what we develop from this point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| how we develop these hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| is gonna dramatically affect Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| and Knox County in the next hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| And I can see people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| hey, those guys were pretty wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| to adopt policies that they saw were necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| from the obvious damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| and obvious negative effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| that had been going on in the previous 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| So we've all got eyes to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| and that's all it takes to see what's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| So what are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3022)|
| 0:50:22| It's a legacy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| A hundred years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| you guys wanna be viewed as doing a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| that protected the water and the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| and economic development of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| And I think those are all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I think you do not have economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| You just cannot have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| unless you have a compatible relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| with the land and what it provides for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Right, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3052)|
| 0:50:52| Mike, if you wanna add to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| why is it so important to you at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Well, I think that there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| as has been stated a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| First of all, the beauty of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| And that is, I like driving down the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| and looking at the scenic areas that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| I enjoy hiking, I enjoy canoeing and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| I enjoy the natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| And so I wanna preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| But in driving down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| because I like a view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| does that mean that the person who owns that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| should not have an opportunity to develop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| if they so choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| So property rights is an issue with me here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| I just bought eight acres in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| And it scares me to death that my neighbor might sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| and there's a development going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I've told him, sell me your land if you decide to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| because I like the idea of maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| my natural resources around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| So I get that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| But the other argument too is that people need jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And if you don't think jobs are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| ask somebody who doesn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| And when you look at the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| that we have in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| and I represented the Fifth District for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| the Farragut area, I mean, it was a boom town, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| So now it's moved out to the Carnes Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| It's going to be moving into Gibbs Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| and it's going to be moving to South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| where I'm at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| So as it moves, I want to see responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I want to have everybody brought to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| so that we can have the carpenters and the electricians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| and the plumbers and the people who need these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| through this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| We can see that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| And so on the one hand, yes, I want to see a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| And I think we're smart enough in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| to sit down and come to the table and figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Sevier County has addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Blount County is addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| I mean, a lot of communities are addressing this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I just talked to some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| who had been involved in Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| So this is nothing new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And I think that we're in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| where we can do something positive and productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| And I think that by bringing the parties together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| I think we can reach the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| where maybe not everybody is happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| and not everybody's going to leave the table happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| but I think that we can have a good document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| that's going to serve us not only now, but years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| So what I hear you saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| one of the things important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| is that we bring everybody at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| or the key players at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| and be able to find something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| that may not be everything everybody's looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| but gives you a place to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Is that kind of what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| I'm going to do the same thing over here with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Now, some of this is not new to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| because some of the commission work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| has been voted on and been up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I don't know quite as much, you know, where the council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| I don't want to rehash everything that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| but doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| I might just go down the line this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| We have one more commissioner, Smith, down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| On the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Oh, you snuck in, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| See, I'm not bright enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| to be able to manage multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| So help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Larry. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Would you, as a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| would you tell me why it's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Well, first of all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| I can take from every one of my colleagues over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| I can relate with just about everyone with what they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| They've all got good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| But my concern is that, you know, Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I represent about 45,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| I want to make the right vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| I want to make the educated vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| So I always want to try to look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| My background is, and I'm a little bit like Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Tony has spent 30 years probably teaching science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| and things at his school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| He's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| He's won awards doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I've got a degree in wildlife management and fisheries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I spent two years with the TVA in the fisheries division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| and four years with TWRA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and stocked the first snail daughters at Teleco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| So I know what it is to be with streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| And I also know, you know, and I like development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| I'm, for both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| But when I see, Marilyn, I'm gonna borrow this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| in a minute, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| But when I see things like this, we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| oh, here's a picture of, you know, with all this exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Well, the guy hadn't finished his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| You know, let the person finish their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| and then let's see what items that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| And if there's something wrong, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| we have things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I just don't think that we're enforcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| the laws that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| And, you know, that's what I'm gonna be doing all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I'm gonna be working in streams this weekend myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| And I know that streams can, 24 hours, 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| certain ones, depending on how fast they go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| but they can rebound pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Some of them, their sedimentation picks up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| and, you know, you have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| So I just think, you know, I'm here to make an educated vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| but I'm also, I can see from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| from the developer side and from the ecologist side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| as to, you know, what's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| straighten out the facts from fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| So what I hear you say also, Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| that's somewhat different from what I've heard before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| is that you're also interested in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| we have all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3342)|
| 0:55:42| And that you can make an educated vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| that is good for, obviously you're pro fishery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| but good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And it's not just swinging one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| based upon emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Is that what I hear is important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| And like what Tony said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3354)|
| 0:55:54| we want to be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| we look back 50 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| hey, did we make that right decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| You want a legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| It's interesting how often that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| We want to leave a legacy for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| We've got quite a legacy already, don't we, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Even more one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Thanks, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| I'm gonna switch over now, you know, to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| I'm gonna start with Marilyn and just work down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Marilyn, why is this important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| You know, I think a lot has been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| by my colleagues on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| And fortunately, I think we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| you talked about the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I think we share a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| there's a lot of commonalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| in terms of why this is important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| I think Commissioner Norman's point that it's a legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| that we all want to make decisions that are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| not only now, but in the future, is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I think Commissioner Hammond's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| property rights are very dear to folks in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| We're a cantankerous, independent, stubborn sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| And on a very base level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| the personality of the peoples of this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| don't like being told what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| And I think that's an emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| that has been stirred in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| And so, you know, trying to balance our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| toward our, to our community in the long range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| with the reality of emotions in the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| I was reared in West Texas, out there in Midland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| So I kind of get that independent sort, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| And so this does feel in some ways like home to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| with people saying, are you telling me what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| You know, and we run into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| but I hear saying what's important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| is much what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Leave a legacy, but respect people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Did I hear you saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And finding a way to do that and finding that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Nick, you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Or what's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| I may just say a me too to the general discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| I think the objective of probably everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| is to try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| I don't think anyone here is fighting a battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| if they're fighting one in order just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| you know, to bar something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| And I think Dr. Briggs brought up an interesting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and that was this up or down decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| seemed to really go against the legislative grain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| that you have where you're trying to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| and meld different interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| and to not be able to tweak something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| that seems a little bit unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| My interests are, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| I think like everyone else has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| that is we have the scenic beauty of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| And we also have the need for jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| and development and activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| But in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| which I represent the city's fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| not the county's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| but it's the Northeast quadrant of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| there are hillsides and we have situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| where there's flooding on the First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| And the flooding comes in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| from developing maybe where we shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| and whether that's on stream banks or on hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| But there are consequences to every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| we take another piece of farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and turn it into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Now, you know, if you're a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| you're trying to get your job done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| and make some money and make homes for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| or whatever you're doing, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| But there are consequences that flow back to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| whether it's schools, roads, or normal infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| or whether it's things like flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| that becomes very, very expensive to try to undo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Once the land has been changed, there's more runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| there's more problems downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| and there's only so much capacity in those natural streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| So I think we're all mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| that we have to have some regulatory scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| The question is how far do we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| before we start stepping on toes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| People bought their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| they expect government to protect their property interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| not to take it away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| You know, and we all hear people say things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| if, you know, if you think that should be a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| then you buy it with your money and pay me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| but don't you tell me that you're going to regulate me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| out of using my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| That's, there's a real battleground in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| and I don't know that it's related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| either to Tennessee or Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| It's kind of a battleground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| If you want a park and a greenway and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| and you want to do it on my land, sorry, this is my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I'm going to do what I want with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| obviously within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| And that's, we're trying to bring that reasonable boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| There has to be some trade-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| What I hear you saying, that last phrase, within reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| And you're saying with that, and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| and come back to say, you know, this is my land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| you're going to mess with my land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| and there's all those extremes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| And you're saying, I want to balance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| from what I hear you saying with the damage done by runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| because, you know, if you do what you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| with your land, and it damages somebody else's land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| you know, and all those within reason become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| and that's what's important is finding a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| to manage that within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| I think it's looking at the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| trying to find a reasonable solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| that protects our scenic values, our property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| including not flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| and the idea of individual land ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Charles, you want to add what's important to you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| And first of all, I want to compliment you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| on the way you're running this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| And I think all the comments are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| I'm hearing a lot of different angles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| that I think need to be expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| And to follow up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| on Commissioner Briggs's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| just to clarify, I know this is not a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| between the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Oh, absolutely not, but we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Yes, clarification is great, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| And then the other thing about the contention-ness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| of this maybe earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| so far I haven't been exposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| The people who have called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| no matter what their views were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| have been very polite to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| We've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| If they thought that I was taking a position here or there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| they were still very polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| So I hope we can keep that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| And any constituents that have input to any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| I hope that they approach us in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| because there's no doubt in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| from what I'm hearing from everybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| we're all willing to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| and we're all sincere about trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| And about that contention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| I used to do work in a store in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| I could have 25 people be kind to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| and then one person blow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| And that just kind of got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3727)|
| 1:02:07| And I think it's not about Tony or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| I think we remember the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And so I'm sure the large majority of people you deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| are very kind, but it doesn't take many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| being really harsh that makes us remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| And so that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Anything else you want to say that's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Yes, I represent the Fifth District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| so there's been a lot of flooding, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| to state the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| And my district has probably gotten hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| at least as bad as any other district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| The vast majority of calls that I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| since I've been on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| has been about the flooding and about the storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| And you have people calling you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| whose homes have been flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| their property is damaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| their insurance may not cover it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| the city can't help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| They go to FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| And so, you know, I'm trying to struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| with how do you prevent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| You know, some homes were probably built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| where they shouldn't have been built to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| as far as just kind of the way flooding occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| and the way natural water flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| I understand completely the arguments about property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| You know, I'm a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| I want to be able to do what I want to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| with my property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| But the focus basically has been on people's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| who is to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| And what I'm hearing is people who are downstream a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| I'm hearing from both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| but mainly from people who are downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| who are suffering from these storms we've been having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| Now, not all of it's related to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| I know that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| But it seems like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| we used to say a hundred year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| It seems like we're having a hundred year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| about every five years now or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| And that these kind of storms are more the norm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| than a fluke, than they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| So I think we have to start thinking in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| of how we can build more responsibly and more sustainably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| And I also want to explore with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| the economic impact of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Because restrictions and good development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| don't necessarily impede economic progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| And cities who have built greener| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| and who have built with a thoughtfulness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| of kind of the overall sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| have actually improved in their economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| And so sometimes I think that there's a kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| of an automatic perceived conflict that may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| That, you know, development's gonna make you money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| environmental stuff is not gonna make you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| And I want to explore that in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| It's a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3900)|
| 1:05:00| But my mind's completely open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| So I hear you say a few things that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| What's interesting to you is property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| but it's also the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| of the people you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And you're saying, yeah, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| there's property rights to those who develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| but there's also property rights of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| who are being affected by development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Is that, am I putting words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| or is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| No, that's exactly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| And then also the idea, and boy, it's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| we tend to be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I don't know what it is about us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| but it's either good or bad, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| And you're saying I would like to explore a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| to find ways that we can find that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| you know, management and development can live together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| And, you know, we all want jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| and we all want the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| I don't think anybody wants to starve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| And I guess what I'm looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| is a way where we can do both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| because they're not necessarily in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| They're not necessarily in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Brenda, they may have said everything, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| You know, the tough part for you and Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| is you're at the end of the row here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| But tell me, what's important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| that might give me some insight, just real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Okay, Joe, I'll leave you a morsel or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| I represent the third district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| and it's adjacent to the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| and we have problems with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| We have some examples in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| of excellent planning and development of hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| and we have some that are just atrocious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| And I would not like to see the atrocious ones occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| I think that we need to be looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| as a balance between property rights and responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| environmental right and environmental responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| And it should not be an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| And we so often want to make this an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| And I think Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| made some strong points at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| that this has become an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| And I don't think that that's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| We don't need to be polarized in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| I chose to live here because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| this is one of the most beautiful places in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| And I want to preserve that beauty for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| We've heard a lot about jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| and right now our economy is not at its strong point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| And so jobs are a really crucial thing to a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| I also know that as we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| how we're going to develop the land or not develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| we need to think about jobs 50, 60, 100 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So a plan that we might think looks attractive now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| is not the kind of legacy I think we want to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| because we need to think about the economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| along with the environmental legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| So I think that's a piece that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| we're all in a position of having to weigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| I feel sorry for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| because I think since they were up to bat first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| they really got the brunt of a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Right, and we caught the tailwind, is that pretty much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| They look like pretty tough bunts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| They're going to be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4065)|
| 1:07:45| We're glad they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Yeah, you know, I feel really sorry for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| but you know, hey, they got it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| You know, I'm sympathetic, but that's the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| It's got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Once again, I don't think that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| a thing that is an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I don't think it needs to be polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| And I think we do need to look at the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| down the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| And I think as Councilman Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| sustainability and sound decisions are very enduring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| What I hear you saying is you want to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| economic responsibility and environmental responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| rather than economics against environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Is that what's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Joe, you want to add to the kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| put the cap on this discussion there for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| What's important to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Well, it's important to me because it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| to us and our natural beauty and our natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| are what we're all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And the ridgetops, the mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| and that's what people come here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| And that's what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| So we want to preserve that and we can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| And there's been bad development and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| So we want to, we recognize this and we want to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| to preserve our natural beauty going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| And having said that, we also understand that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| have property rights and people have rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| So what we're trying to do is figure out a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| find a way through this plan that we can preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| people's property rights and at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| preserve our natural scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Isn't it interesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| A guy, you probably knew this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| but you know what jumped out at me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| How similar everything sounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| I want to just throw in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| and you may experience this while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| They talked about some of the districts there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| the flooding and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| And I own property in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I own some commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| What I've noticed, the city at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| used to clean the creeks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| I'm talking a creek is as wide as from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| to the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| You've got big trees in these creeks now going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| And so when it rains, and I'm talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| because I just noticed this a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| as I've come in different intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| you look on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| and you're looking at first creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| and my goodness, you can't see the creek for the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| So people, every time it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| people say, well, there's that ridgetop flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Well, maybe and maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I just, you know, if those were cleared out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| if we can get back to that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| and clean the creeks out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| and so that water, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| get that water on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| then let's see if we still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| And you make a point that I want to get to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| But what I, I want to come back to that, Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| because I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| And you're really testing me here, Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| sitting away from your name tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| because I don't remember my wife's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4230)|
| 1:10:30| I'll kiss him next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| I won't be up in the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| But, but everyone here said pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| You know, in different ways, different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| but you know what, economic development's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| I want a legal legacy for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| I want clean water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| I want economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| And then I heard almost everybody say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| somewhere we got off track and this became a battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| Is that, is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Somewhere along the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| this became pretty competitive and pretty rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| And so what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| I've been hearing what's important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| what excites me, because I've sat in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I mean, I did one with this, this oil company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| and it's about something called fracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| where they pour it, push water down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| and it ruins the groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| That was the most contentious discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I've seen in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| And people were on this end and this end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| and attacking one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| And what I was looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| number one, I want to know what's important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| because what we want to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| is meet yours and community's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| But I also wanted to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| how competitive you were with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And I know that there's more to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| and you're being nice and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| but I honestly believe we've got a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| of really good common ground that we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| With that in mind, because I know I have a limited time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| and I've got to check my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| There's a couple of things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| One of those, what Larry brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| about the idea of more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| One of our jobs is to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| one of my jobs here is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| that we get accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| I've heard people say to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| you know, we already got the laws on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| If we just enforce those, we wouldn't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| Then I've heard other people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| no, that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Those laws are fine, but they're not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Now, one of our jobs is to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| that factual information out there for you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| That's one of the things we're going to commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| We're going to kind of find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| about the creek cleaning, how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| We're going to find out what laws are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| We're going to find a way to kind of lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| that out in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| We may put up here graphically for you to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| what's being done, what kind of enforcement's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| We're going to put up the creeks or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| We want to get all the information we can in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Here's what we don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| We don't want to spend this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| debating factual information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Because we get factual information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| I mean, that's just, that's looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| So we have a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| So if it's all right with you in terms of process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| in between meetings, we'll gather the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| We'll get them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:00| We may email them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| We may put them on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| We may put them, I don't know how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| But if you have a question about factual information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| be sure and let me know and you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| and we're going to make sure we get the facts right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Because what I find out in these meetings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| you're really bright people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| and we don't want to spend our time chasing facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| that we can easily get and just hand out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| So if you have a question about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| you're not sure the facts on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| please let me and others know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| and we will get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Because I find that if we can get the facts cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| it doesn't always, facts don't resolve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| but the lack of facts can gum it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| And I really don't want to spend an evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| of somebody saying, well, the current laws will do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and somebody else saying, no, they won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| We'll just check the laws, get it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| discuss it, and then talk about what's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Steve, if I can jump in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| I would like to add one thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| and that is, if there is a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| between the city and the county approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| and I don't know that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| but it is somewhat based on the proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| that water flows downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| and the county surrounds the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| and all that area has more undeveloped land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| and that water flows through creeks and streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| to the city and to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| and so where there's flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| to some degree, we're on the receiving end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| And I don't mean to say that that's isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| and only we and not they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| but there is that aspect that there's gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| more development spread out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| than there is in the city, which has kind of grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| It's a nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| You can't have, the county's gonna be your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| From what I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| your development's gonna be in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| and you're right, it seems the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| on the receiving end of the floodwaters, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| And so what I wanna say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| we're gonna do the homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| and we're gonna put the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| so if Larry says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| if we just clean those creeks, I'll take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| we'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And if somebody says, we've already got laws in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| my response is, really, let's look them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Let's see what they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| and see how they're being enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| And then we will check all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| so that while we're here, we can focus on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| And we're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And I'm gonna ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I'm gonna definitely be checking with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I'm gonna be, by the way, I'm gonna be talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| to the developers, I'm gonna be talking to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I mean, this is not you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| it's the city trying to find out what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| And I don't even think it's the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| versus the environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| I mean, I know it feels that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| but it couldn't be people who wanna develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| and people who want us to deal with the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| have just not found a way to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| And that's what we wanna work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Now, there's one really specific issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| that we've got to decide, it's a process issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| And I don't know how else to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I've thought about what are different ways to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| What do you wanna accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| How do you wanna get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| There's two ways to go about it that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| we've worked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Both of them work, it depends on what you guys wanna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| In other words, my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| when we get to September 1, we'd like to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| to get to a place that you guys could come to agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| amend, or do what you need to with this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| of policy and regulations so you can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| Is that your understanding of what we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Well, based on what they brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| when they brought the document to us in the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| it's not an amenable document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Whatever we decide on, I mean, is gonna have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| totally put down and rewritten, right Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4609)|
| 1:17:00| Mark Donaldson with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| State law is structured so that authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| to adopt an amendment to the regional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| is given to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| with the ability by the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| to make that operative, basically to ratify that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| The Planning Commission adopted a version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| of the task force's plan, they made some amendments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| The County Commission has elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| not to make that operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| That same law provides the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| the authority to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| So you could, in fact, turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| take that document as a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| amend it any which way you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| submit it, initiate it as your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| It goes to the Planning Commission for a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| then comes back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| But that's not the option we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| The plan that you had in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| was the version adopted by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| so you had to either ratify that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| But that's only step one of what could be another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| We could be the initiator in essence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| and send it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| So, thank you Mark, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| And again, that's one of those fact things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| that we're gonna check, make sure we do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| But my understanding on the back side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| you would like to have either a new plan or amended plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| whatever the facts require you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| so that you guys can put this thing to bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| and move forward if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| What I believe will happen from the little bit I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| is there are certain points of leverage or sticking points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| that are going to be kind of where we have conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| a lot of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| One of those will be slope, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| I mean, everybody I talk to, slope comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| There's two ways to have the slope conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| One of them is we can bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| we can talk in this group about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| and list it as one of the things we want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| And this is what some bodies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Then those bodies come up with two or three or four things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| that they think we've got to address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| to come to agreement on before we can move over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Then those bodies would do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| You would have the commission appoint two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| and the council appoint two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Those people over a certain week's period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| over a two week period work with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| to build a recommendation to bring back to the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| that you guys can then debate and decide upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| That's one approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| And that can be a fairly efficient approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| If that's the approach, this is how the meetings look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| Tonight we do process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Next week, we do the meat of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| and come up with those key touch points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| that have to be leveraged and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| During that meeting, you guys agree upon those points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| and then you will assign people over the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| to meet with us and come up with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| The third meeting, we bring that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| and the large group works on those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| We spend the next two weeks after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| coming to amend and adapt those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| so the fourth meeting, you're able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| That's one approach and if that's acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| and within your bylaw structure, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| The other approach is to bring up each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| and discuss each of them per meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| That's a little, with everybody in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| And so what that would entail is next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| we come up with the two or three ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Each one of those are brought up before the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| and then the group will decide to discuss that each week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| on each topic and try to come to conclusion, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| Now, I'm getting a lot of work from the staff over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| which means I may be walking all over something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| that you guys need to do differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| That's why we have really bright people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| My-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Steve, the issue is the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Having, if you have two commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| then that's gonna have to be Sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| and it's gonna have to be publicly noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| So as long as we're working within that framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| but just within the guidelines of our Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| The Sunshine Law, which again, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| You can actually publicly notice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| and have their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| We wanna work within your structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| and that's the great thing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Now, what we need to know tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and we've got to decide tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| which of those two approaches best fits where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| Do you prefer the subcommittees have their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| and make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| or do you prefer each topic be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| by the entire committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| And I'm gonna really leave it back up to the two chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| to decide how we wanna manage that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| because I need to know that from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| When do you need to know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I'd like to know it pretty, like as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| If you guys wanna talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| I would need, at the latest, I would need to know midweek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| as we prep for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| So you can decide now, you can decide later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| and inform me, I'm good with either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Steve, we have a meeting Monday, the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| and we have some commissioners that are not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| and so we actually have a luncheon on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I'll make sure that that's on our luncheon agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| and I think we can decide on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| and have this discussion and if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| we can let you know for sure by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| that meeting's over with on Monday, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4945)|
| 1:22:25| Are there any questions about what I'm proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| Does everybody kind of understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| I understand it, I personally, Steve, I'm over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| I'd personally like to discuss it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| and I don't see why we can't go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| and make a decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| but if the body feels that it would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| to wait till the other ones are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| so I'm fine with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4964)|
| 1:22:44| but I'd certainly like to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Let's go ahead and briefly talk about the strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| and the weaknesses of that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Then you guys, I'm gonna defer to Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| that on Monday you guys can have that full discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| and let me know, but I certainly don't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| talking about that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| I'll kind of tell you about what I think the strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| and weaknesses are of those two models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| and I want you guys to talk to me about it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| Nick, did you, your button's on, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| I just wanted to mention that before you got involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| and in fact were even asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| there was a question of whether we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| a subcommittee approach, a couple from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| a couple from commission, and virtually everyone said no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| let's meet, the whole bodies meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| and the reason is it's an important topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| and I think that no one has the perfect answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| but collectively the information will be on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| so discussing it tends to air it all out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| and hopefully at that point the public at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| has a basis to say, well, they're doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| or they're crazy, let's get rid of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| but at least it's out in the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| and I think that's the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| of a continued group discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| One thing I wouldn't want, I know that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| people say, well, should we add other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| to these subcommittees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| At this point I think it's your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| we're coming down to you guys being able to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| so let's talk about the idea of the large group discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| Nick described the strength of that large group discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| which we've done, it can all be aired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| and everybody has their say and they have their moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| The weakness of the large group discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| it's a slower process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| The only, I guess, caveat I would have on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| is a lot of the issues about why the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| would need to be modified are technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| that we just about need to have some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| and really some of the developers can't even answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| but the developers, engineers can answer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| about why you can build on this type of slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| or why this harms the environment or what problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I think as long as we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| the responsible developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| and they all can't come down here and say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| because a lot of the problems have been, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| just bad development, bad developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| who really didn't have an interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| preventing some of the problems that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| but some of these really and truly are technical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| particularly at the lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| I've talked to some developers that quite frankly say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| over a 25% grade, they don't really have a lot of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| because it's just too tough to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| And a lot of this seems to be with the 15 to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| I know there's been some on the 15 to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| You can sort of pick the number where you draw the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| but you almost need to have technical people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| to tell us what can be done and what cannot be done safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| And so it's hard, at least for me, to deliberate on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| because I just don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| the engineering background to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| And that takes us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| to the factual information point again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| One of the things we do with factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| is bring expertise to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| And so as we work on this, and I hear from somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| we need to know the technical aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Then what we've got to do is bring somebody to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| who can give that to you in language you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I mean, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| I'm reading through this sometimes and I'm thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| okay, I got to find somebody in the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| explain to me what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| And that's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| So that, and by the way, that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| in large group or in small group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| And I'm not advocating one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| You decide that there are two approaches, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| And let me real quick, Mike, I'm gonna turn back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| but I want you, so the large group approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| affects a lot of what Nick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| So what we get here in the large group approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| is kind of sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Everybody gets it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Everybody gets the same information as they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| We're all moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| We're having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| The downside of that, it takes longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| You know, and I can't guarantee you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| by September one and four meetings, we've done all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| Now that I'm not against going further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| and having longer conversations with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| but you've got to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| that that's a more extended process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| when everybody's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| The upside of the subcommittee is expedited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| It expedites the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| In other words, they tend to be able to bring somebody in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| come recommendations and come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| and you may move more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Now I don't say effectively, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| You move more efficiently with your subcommittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| bringing recommendations back in terms of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| The downside of that is of course, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| We've had subcommittees and they bring stuff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| and we need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| And is it really moving us forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| And so those are the two kinds of, Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| the two kinds of things you've got to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| I'm going to go to Mike and back over here to Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Mike, you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| I'd just like to put in a plug also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| for the having it all here at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| They've both, Nick and Dr. Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| both have brought up some good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| but also you have two sides, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| the antis and the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| It's easier when everybody is on the same playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| rather than trying to play a ball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| one here and one in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| one inning here and one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| or half an inning here and half there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| But if everybody's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| they're going to have another chance to bring this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| and the bottom line on all of it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| there's maybe four major sticky points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| that if the proper information is disseminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| and explained fully how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| it's going to eliminate a lot of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| because, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| they were told wrong in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| But if we can get past those four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| So what I hear you saying, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| is that you like the idea of getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Everybody hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Not sitting, assuming what other people are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| and that's important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| I also hear you say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| if the information is correct, a lot of this goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And that may be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Now, sometimes these situations that's not necessarily true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| because other times people have interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| that are disconnected with information, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| But we on the front end want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| we get the right information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| I mean, you know, we don't want to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| without all the information no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| But we need to justify the decision we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| But then you want to use that decision based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| So I'm hearing you say you like the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| even if it takes a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| might be a meeting or two longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| whatever it takes to get us there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| you're willing to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| I'm going to go back here to Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| then back over to Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Then I'm going to kind of tie that discussion up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| and leave it to the chairs to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Even in your process is what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| What about public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| Are you going to, I know we've got the expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| what Dr. Bridges was talking about at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| are you having time at the end of all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| at the end of every week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| or at the end of the whole process to have public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| We plan to have public input tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| And I plan to work with the chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| because it's important that there be public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| consistently throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| So what we want is we want to have accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| Let me tell you what else I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I'm going to work really hard to be talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| to as many of you who want to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| And I want to connect with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| I want to talk to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| I want to talk to people who have interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| So we learn as much as we can about making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| On top of that, I think it's important on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| that public comment be able to be made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| What we don't want to do is leave the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| somehow we're cutting people out of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| I think that is damaging to my credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| and damaging to you guys being able to make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Now, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Here's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| You could put it on a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| and you could disseminate over the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| and you could call everybody in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| and you could go to their house and tell them it's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| and somebody's going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| I had no idea, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| All you can control is process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| that's a point of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| You can't control how they react to your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| You can't own something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| If somebody wants to cause a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| you can't own it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| We just want to make sure we treat them right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| we have good process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| people have opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| and it's a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| And this is what I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| You guys are used to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| No matter what you decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| somebody's going to be unhappy with you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| So let's just make sure we did a good process when we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| And then we can all sleep at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Tony, last comment on this before we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| I'd certainly speak for the full body discussion process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| Certainly with the commission taking it up formally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| in that discussion, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| we had a range of positions on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| from me on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| and then all the way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| probably with a six-five vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| So we had extremes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| probably in terms of pro and anti the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| So it would be difficult, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| to do the subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| like, how are you going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| without having one of these extremes on the subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Plus, there is somewhat of a poisoned atmosphere also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| from misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| And so we're fighting against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| There's people that are on these bodies, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| that have taken in the poison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| And they are disseminating the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| But I'm not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| I'm just saying there is polarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| There's polarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| There's polarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| And for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| this total group thing would probably work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| We're probably going to use the word poison a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| But, well, especially for environmentalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| But anyway, the idea of polarity of position is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| I will say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| when you've got a big polarity of position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| a lot of disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| people tend toward, using y'all's phraseology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| more sunshine rather than less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| So here's what I want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Remember, I'm facilitating, you're deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Man, everybody's just touching buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| I'm going to come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I'll let you guys have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| And then we'll kind of move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Brenda, then Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| When we had our initial meeting of the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| and the full council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| we talked about subcommittees and committee of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| And I left that night with the clear understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| that we voted to have a committee of the whole hear things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| And while I understand that does take longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| I also understand that the same words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| go into everyone's ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| They may not always hear the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| or have the same intonation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| but I think that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I like that sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| And you know, it's fun for me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| You know, I'm good with either approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Charles, want to add anything else to that comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5622)|
| 1:33:42| I just wanted to speak in favor of the full body approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| I think it's just important that everybody hears everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and any of the suspicion that lingers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| We know we're all hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| We don't have to get it secondhand from the subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| What we're going to do is give it to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Steve, if I could ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Does any of the commissioners want the subcommittee plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Well, I think we're decided on the commission side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| We'll go with the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| We have a light on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Oh, I'm sorry, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| The risk of being a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| We made this decision the last time we met in a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And we looked at exactly those two options that you talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and the committee of the whole was decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| So, then they've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Not only My Forest Sunshine, we are decided we're for Sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| You're kind of talking about the same thing over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Is that kind of what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| No, there was just concern about the subcommittee approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| and people not hearing the same messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| and decisions being made by a smaller group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| And the decision was made very strongly last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| that everybody needed to be at the table all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| So, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Well, gee, you just made that easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5688)|
| 1:34:48| I want to check my notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Steve, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5692)|
| 1:34:52| Quick question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| You said that we may need to extend our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| You're talking about more meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| or you're talking about making these meetings longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| No, not more meetings probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| But it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Usually, it's an additional meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| rather than extending the length of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| I don't know anybody who wants to make it longer at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| But you'll let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| We don't get that check from the man back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| A two-hour meeting, Steve, is a very, very short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| You guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Long for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| You know, that's why you have such great leaders up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| They can have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| I'll make sure I'm in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| In five minutes, I'm going to turn it over to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| for public comment, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Because I think we've got a long ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| Several things I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Let me interrupt you just a second, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| If we are going to have public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| and I know at one point we decided we were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| But I appreciate what you said in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| of if you have a process that includes public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| that's important from a perceptual standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| And we've always, on our side, the council side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| been very adamant about public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| So if we're going to have public input, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| we probably need to have a time frame there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| And then we need to ask for a sign-up sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| And at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| ask people that would like to participate to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| So then we can kind of factor in the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| and allow the appropriate amount of time to each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| depending on how many we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And it may be that's great to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| And it may be that you guys tonight don't want to do public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| because we haven't properly prepped for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| We're going to have to leave it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Well, it's 635.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| And if we went another 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| and then allowed 15 minutes for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| we could go ahead and ask people from the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| to sign a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| We could make one up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And if we have everybody in the building wants to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| maybe we might reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| But I think that's probably, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| if you agree with that, in 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| we'll close it off and open it up to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Let me ask, does anyone out there want to address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Does anyone want to make any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| We have one, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5840)|
| 1:37:20| Four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I think if we could-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Maybe give them three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Three minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5844)|
| 1:37:24| Yes, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| And then we'll, and I'll make sure from now on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| that we have a discussion up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| on how to manage the public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I appreciate you helping with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| You know, it's fascinating to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| the opportunity that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| We have a group of people here who are really bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| You represent a cross-section of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| And all of you, early on, when you spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| about what's important, you spoke about legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| At some level, I heard legacy from almost everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| We want to leave a place that our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| and our grandkids can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| We want to have good streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| We want to have clean streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| We don't want flooding in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| At the same time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| we've got to have business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| We can't afford not to allow people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| to grow their businesses and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| This is really not great timing in terms of economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| You know, if this discussion were had in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| I don't know Knoxville's economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| but it might have been an easier discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| But right now, we have people who aren't even getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| a lot of work, and now they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| hey, are you going to push me out of the work I'm getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| And yet, you're committed to finding a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| and what I really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| you seem committed as two legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| of finding a way to protecting the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| protecting the mountains, protecting the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| and at the same time, working with the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| the chamber, the developers, and all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| and trying to find a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| And the other thing I heard from you tonight is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| All of you know that none of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| are going to get everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| And I think it's important that this process takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| that all of us accept, everybody in this room accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| whatever we end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| it's probably not going to be everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| And if we can realize that, that, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| if you get 80% of what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| and you're almost already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| if we get 80% further down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| how much better are we off than we are right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| And if the people can come to a place where they can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| yes, we've reached this slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| and yes, we understand how to grade at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| and we're going to do some things about the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| and we're going to have some structure about the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| and we're going to protect the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| and we're going to do all of that in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| that we don't run our developers out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| And it doesn't have to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| No legislation's perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| but you will find a place to be productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| And that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| What we commit to you is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| we're going to do our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| We will take care of the factual issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| because it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| You guys don't do this full-time, most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| You don't have the technical expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| We're going to find it, and we're going to disseminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| I also believe, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| that just information won't resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Because people, they debate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| but people also have interests that we've got to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| But we want to be accurate with our information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| meet as many people's interests as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| and come to a conclusion that's best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| That's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| We will tend not to take a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| within these next meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| trying to clarify factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| unless it's completely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| We'll spend most of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| working on the interest and the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| on each of those topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| Next meeting, we're going to get into the meat of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| I want you to be thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| I'm going to give you some homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| I want you to be thinking about what are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| I heard somebody say there's about four things hanging us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Did I hear somebody say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Now think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| I want you to think about those three or four things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| and then I also want you to then prioritize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| in order of how important are they to you and your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| If those three or four things are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| you need to be writing those down and prioritizing those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| why they're important to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| and then under those priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| write down why you've listed that one, two, three, or four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| and how tied you are to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Those are important so we can have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| And next two weeks from now when we come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| I hope to have had some good discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| with people in the community and with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| and we're going to move into the meat of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| I am honored that we get to be a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| I look forward to talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Yes, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Are you finished with these comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| I had one about public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Of course, I'm probably the person that started this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| and I might be a little hypersensitive to abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| because I've been abused publicly, privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| I am somewhat, and when I look into the audience right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| I'm not worried about one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| I know almost everybody in this audience about any comment they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| But we have people in our community that come to public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and poison is not nearly adequate a term, if you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| So in terms of a civil discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| I hope we'll have some ground rules that come from the chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| or come from you that are protective of people that are on these bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| and acknowledge what civil discussion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| because we have had some egregious examples in public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| of just absolute off-the-wall behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6194)|

| 1:43:39| to see if we need to build it in such a way that we address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6219)|
