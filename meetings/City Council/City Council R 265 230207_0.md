| 0:13:01| question. We are working through that process that it's utilizing federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| funds so there's a pretty lengthy process that we're working through. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| are through the environmental part of that process now and so we're in design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=791)|

| 0:15:09| not there in his chair. Chief Sharp couldn't be here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| unexpectedly but David Brace is available to answer questions. I just if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| Mr. Brace could elaborate on what exact equipment and stuff. Yeah thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| much Councilwoman Ryder. This is for equipment at the fire stations so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| special washing machines to help clean turnout gear. That has been an issue in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| the fire service cleaning carbon off of that gear and having those washers in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| the stations. It's also for workout equipment at stations so we can upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| that equipment so that firefighters can obviously stay in shape and be healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| And then the third piece of this is I think you're aware because you approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| the acquisition of an ambulance that would serve the needs of the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| department and the police department during critical scenes fires and high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| risk situations and there's some equipment that is needed for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| specifically a really expensive gurney or cart that actually has a motor on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| so that firefighters don't have to lift. They can use this motored cart but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| pretty expensive and so we're putting this in through FEMA. It's due February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| 10th and we would hear back sometime in April about those dollars. As we get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| budget you will also notice that many of these items are within those capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| request items as well. Appreciate the clarity. Yep. Councilmember Parker. Part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=987)|
| 0:16:37| of my question was included in that response but I reached out to Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Sharp about the ambulance and this funding to try to get a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| clarity of how it would be used and learned we haven't had one. The Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| Fire Department hasn't had an ambulance in over 30 years and so I was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| get more clarity around how much of that cost the ambulance would be covered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| this. So my understanding, one the ambulance, the physical chassis and most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| equipment has already been ordered and that has been done through fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| services as part of our normal specification where our fleet team works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| with the fire department. I would have to look specifically I believe that device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| the cart that if someone is loaded on and off of an ambulance is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| $70,000. It's very expensive and so out of that grant I believe the cart is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| about 70. I can get you an exact number and shoot that out to council but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| ambulance is already on order. It should be here this summer with the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| on it. It will have a very basic cart but it's a cart that requires physical your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| back and legs to lift someone up into the ambulance and so we wanted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| this add-on and thought that this grant would be a good way to get that what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| I'll call an A plus piece of equipment. We're going to get kind of the BB plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| piece that requires manual labor. But and I guess I would just say that when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| ambulance is already in process and will be operational even if we don't get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| grant. Yes. It just won't be have that extra level of equipment. Fancy cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Chief Sharp got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| some questions and wasn't the one time he wasn't here. Anyhow, thank you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| seeing no further questions all those in favor please say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1114)|

| 0:19:09| Director Webb earlier today about kind of the scope of this and appreciated you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| sharing a little bit about the strategic planning that your department does and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| just one thing that I wanted to emphasize I don't know necessarily if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| it's needed for this contract but perhaps but that in our planning we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| not only thinking about our commitments as a city to the climate goals but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| community goals that we're asking the community to to meet by a certain period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| of time and so in that in terms of that long-range planning we might need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| think about how we are providing services and what that needs to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| like 10 or 20 years from now and so I was wondering with this contract how far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| out we're looking are we taking into consideration those goals that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| as a city not just in terms of reducing our own emissions but providing city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| services that will make it easier for the public to reduce their emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Yeah. Chad Webb, Public Service Director. I mean I think we're always looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| that I mean obviously we have recycling downtown and we're continuing to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| recycling we're starting a new composting program as well that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| got a pretty big grant for that's coming so I mean I definitely think we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| ways of how we can reduce you know the amount of trash that's produced downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1250)|

| 0:20:59| like that unfortunately that infrastructure is just not in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230207?start=1259)|
