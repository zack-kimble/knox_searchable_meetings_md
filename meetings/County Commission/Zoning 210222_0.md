| 0:08:01| further explain their stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| There will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| 16 acres of land donated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=485)|

| 0:08:21| The reason the land has not yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| been donated is that should this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| property not be rezoned and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| rezoned, the land could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| for parking lots and storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=509)|

| 0:09:01| have seen the true potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| in developing this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=543)|

| 0:09:07| with affordable homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| It is without a doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| a challenging site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| especially if the traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=553)|

| 0:09:17| of development is to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| We have developed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| preliminary green build concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=561)|

| 0:09:25| the infrastructure will be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| This would be addressed more specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| at the concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=571)|

| 0:09:39| 2.51 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=579)|

| 0:09:51| of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I ask that you vote to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| approve this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| at which point the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=597)|

| 0:11:13| Neighborhood. And altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| we represent over 700 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| who oppose and will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| severely affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| The track we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| about, ladies and gentlemen, is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| a ridgeline. It's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| White's Creek and a railroad on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| and Beverly Road and Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Drive on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| That track has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| approximately 80 acres, but only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| 61 acres are buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| The rest are in a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Nothing can be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| It's not just a floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| by name. It's a real floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| If you had a chance to look at the many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| photographs that my neighbors and I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| you before this meeting, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| some of the flooding that's taking place there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| two or three times every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Two or three times every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| year, White's Creek floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Beverly Road right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| the entrance where this development is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| to. The only entrance to this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| has three to four feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| of water, and this is three or four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| The flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| just doesn't affect White's Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| because White's Creek runs into First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| and then it goes down Broadway, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Neighborhoods miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| are going to suffer from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| 2018, when the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| first proposed this project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| it went before the Planning Commission for the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| first time, Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Director Gerald Green said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| and I'm quoting him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| quote, this is the worst piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| that has ever come before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=759)|

| 0:12:43| And staff planner Michael Brousseau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| who later left the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| and apparently is now working as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| consultant for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| this is what he said. He said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| when you talk about rough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| properties, this is about as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| rough as a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| as I've ever seen, end of quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| And because this property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| so unsuitable for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| the Planning Commission in 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| turned down the developer's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| for over 200 units and instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| limited it to one unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| per acre, excluding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| floodway, not to exceed a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| of 61 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| The developer then came before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| the Commission. There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| meeting in June of 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| trying to get you to ignore the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| But my neighbors and I didn't ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Over 100 of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| showed up in buses and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| expressed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| And because of that, when it became evident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| that you were not going to grant what the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| wanted when the developer saw the writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| on the wall, he withdrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| just like he's threatening to withdraw now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| if you don't give him what he wants tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| But he withdrew and went home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| At this point, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| stop after this, in the summer of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| 2018, the developer wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| out any money because he didn't own the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| then. He only had an option to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| he could have walked away and saved himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| money. But he decided to gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| He decided he could convince| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| you eventually to give him what he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| So he rolled the dice and he bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| my time is about, my four months is running out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| so I'll stop for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| But this was just the first time he came before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| you. There's been two more additional times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| I'll talk about those in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Okay. I'm going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Mr. Guinard, maybe since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| they were mentioned, a member of your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| who is on a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| a member of your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| who is on a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| up to four more minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| to sort of rebut and then Mr. Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| will hear from you again and then I'll kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| open it up to commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| So Mr. Guinard, does any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| member, you or your member, you're on a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| don't want to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Well, if Chris Grange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| you could just address floating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Hi. Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Okay. Chris Grange, 5405 Blue Ridge Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| key issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| to consider with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| flooding is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| the site plans proposed is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| a flood planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| proposed is not a flood planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| It's a flood planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| proposed, sort of the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| What's being proposed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| keeping the development out of the flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| plane. It's actually more conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| with regard to flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| and increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| runoff volumes than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| anything that would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| in the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I've lived in Knoxville all my life. I know Dr. Smoot, he's a well-respected hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=955)|
| 0:16:04| The point that I think is pertinent here is that what's being proposed is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| different than the usual development that folks are used to seeing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| You've probably seen the letter I wrote, so I'd be repeating that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| one thing that I didn't say in it is one of my responsibilities at Knox County was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| the floodplain manager, so I was responsible for the county's compliance with FEMA programs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| concepts and policies related to floodplain management. Site plans that do what is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| proposed would be a dream for someone managing a floodplain. Them doing it voluntarily is fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=998)|
| 0:16:49| extraordinary on top of that. Again, staying out of the slope, staying out of the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| and concentrating development in the appropriate development areas is a new pattern. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| something everybody's familiar with and you can go drive around the county and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| but it's probably something we're going to see. Whether we see it here, whether we see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| somewhere else, we're going to see this is the pattern we're going to be seeing in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| in Knox County. So, I think I'll quit at that. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Granju. Mr. Taylor, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1037)|
| 0:17:26| look back to you and then we'll go to our commissioners for questions. Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Thank you. As I was saying, in 2018, the developer failed in his first try to get this rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| but he went ahead and bought the property anyway, even though he didn't own it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| he just had an option. He waited a year and then he came back in December of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| and he once again tried to get you to change your minds and give him what he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| But once again, at the January 2020 commission meeting, over 100 of my neighbors and I showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| up and brought buses again and we expressed our opposition. And once again, it became clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| you, the commission, were not going to give him what he wanted. So, once again, he withdrew and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| went home. And that brings us back to now, today, the third try. And just as you've heard, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| Winard is threatening you once more that if you don't give him what he wants, he's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| withdraw. And I really take issue with this idea that if you don't give him what he wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| then he's going to go out there and put tires and other materials there and store them on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| That's a threat. That's all it is, a threat. And I really take issue with this idea that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| flooding isn't real. You know, these pictures, this is from January 3, 2020, that shows three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| feet of water on Beverly Road. This is not a projection of what might happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| This is not a weather prediction. This is what's out there right now. That's out there where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| rainwater now is being absorbed by the ground. Can you imagine what it's going to be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| if 200 plus units are out there and now all that water that used to be absorbed by the ground is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| running off roads and driveways and asphalt and into White's Creek and then into First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and down and onto Broadway? That's what's going to happen. And not only are the people downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| going to be adversely affected, the people in the neighborhood are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| You know, like I said, this is the only entrance to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| That means that two or three times a year, the people who live in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| are going to be marooned. They can't get in or out. If their house catches on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| a fire truck can't get to them. If they have a medical emergency, an ambulance can't get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Mothers are not going to be able to go pick up their kids from school because of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| With all respect, ladies and gentlemen, the Planning Commission was correct back in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| This is the worst piece of property to come before the NPC. My neighbors and I are willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| compromise. If you feel like that some residential development is permissible on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| then please go back to what the Planning Commission did in 2018 and allow a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| of only one dwelling unit per acre, excluding the floodway, which means a maximum of 61 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| If you will do that, then we'll live with it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you, Mr. Taylor. I'll open the questions up for commissioners first. I'll look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| to the Commission District Representative first, unless you'd like to defer, Ms. Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| I'll defer to other commissioners for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Commissioner Beeler, I see your hand up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess probably this question is maybe for Mr. Gennard or a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| of his team. With respect to both sides, I think it's very obvious to everybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| if nothing is done to this property, it floods, as it is. It clearly floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| Sometimes it floods very badly. And so I guess, and forgive me if Mr. Grungew addressed this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| my layman's ear didn't catch it as well as I should have, but what is the plan or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| any plan to potentially improve the flooding propensity of this property if it is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| in the way that Mr. Gennard and his team intend to develop it? And I'll wait for your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1281)|
| 0:21:30| You're on mute, Mr. Gennard or Mr. Grungew, whoever wants to take that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| Okay. Yeah, I'll see if I can take that. It sounded like it had to do with hydrology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| Well, a couple things. One is, when you're looking at land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| land development isn't going to prevent flooding. Those photos of flooding on First Creek and White's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| Creek, you can save the fuel and just change the dates on them. Because when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| extreme rainfall events, especially when they're on the heels of heavy rainfall seasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| we're going to have flooding. It's just, it's the nature of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| A good development is a development that does no harm. So it's going to be a development that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| going to not add a flood risk. And I think that was what the designer was charged with on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| is how do you take this really difficult piece of land and do a design where you do no harm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1354)|
| 0:22:42| Well, what he did was look at techniques of infiltration. So you're right, you're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1362)|
| 0:22:51| hard surfaces. There's no way to build dwellings humans live in without them having hard surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| But there are opportunities to infiltrate and infiltrate in areas that don't already infiltrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| in other words, outside or above the floodplain, basically in a soil sense when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| hydrology. And that's what the designer is doing. And that's why earlier I didn't go into the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| of why, but I said this is an innovative approach. It's a new concept that, you know, whether it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| goes now or goes a year from now, it's going to be what we're seeing, what we see in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| And it's the best approach for this area. So will it prevent flooding? No, nothing's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| prevent flooding that any individual will do on a piece of land that size. But asking it to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| create an additional flood risk is a very realistic goal, realistic request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| Commissioner Bailey, is that? Yes, that's all for now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman Jay. I have a question for Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| please. Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Biggs. Director Snowden, how are you? I'm all right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1438)|
| 0:24:09| I was looking at the map and where we have the apartment complex and housing units and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| things of that nature. Can you tell me a little bit more where on this, I guess, is designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| maybe RB, the hilltop and slope protection program, as well as the grading and things of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| that nature? Yes, Commissioner Biggs. And I think in the packet that Amy's folks have put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| kind of shows a little bit of that. There's a slope and hillside analysis sheet. If you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| kind of the primary area that is zoned RB is contained within the 25 to 40 and greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1483)|
| 0:24:53| 40 percent slope. Looks like there's probably in the neighborhood of about 28 acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| So, the bulk of the RB zone property on Mr. Grenard's property appears to be within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| slope and hillside protection. Now, keep in mind that that is advisory in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| not mandatory, but the bulk of where the RB property is does appear to lie within the steeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| slope area. Okay. So, does this road, whenever to gain entrance into this development, is it a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1521)|
| 0:25:34| road or is it a city road? It is a city street. The property is in the county, but the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| Drive at that location is a city street. Okay. I'm going to jot some stuff down and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Bussler, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Back in 1992, there was a plan made and it was almost, it was approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1558)|
| 0:26:07| MPC because I was on the MPC when it did to help mitigate the water runoff. There was a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| the community came up and just got really requested, made it political, and it did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| There was another issue came up later on that could have made it better, won't stop the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| but lessen the damage that the flooding would do. And the people in the community that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| living right there on it, and again, there is a industrial steel plant that's right there next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| it. They decided not to do anything for it back then. So in the early 90s, there were plans made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1604)|
| 0:26:54| to help mitigate the problem before all the other development got around it and people didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| to do anything with it then. It's rolled back around again and we have a chance to say we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| mitigate some of that. But in plan residential, the developer has to address the issue of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| on and off that road. The city would have to do some improvement, but we could also do improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| of getting the water away quickly into another area. And I live in an area where we have wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| flooding down Beaver Creek. And every year we do some things on it to lessen the damage that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| being done by that flooding. We can go ahead and say, nope, we're not going to do anything with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| and it will flood. Yes, you won't be able to cross that road sometimes. But if we do something now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| we can lessen that issue of flooding in that area. And plans have come about and with plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1665)|
| 0:27:54| the developer has to address those issues before we can go ahead and build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Or we can leave it like it is and there will be a developer that will buy that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| and put 260 some units on it and all he has to do is ask for a building permit. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1684)|
| 0:28:13| that's not a threat that can happen. And it happened in my area where people would not listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| and to go to a plan residential and they left it like it was and there was some development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| going on that lessened the property around them. So it's up to you all what you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| I know what I would like to do with it would be to lessen the problem. So thank you for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| and just want to let you know where it goes back as far as 1992. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| Commissioner Lundy, you're up next. Thank you, Chairman. Can I hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Gerald Green? I know he's been quoted in the article that he said was the worst piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| property ever. I just want him to expand on that. Is he available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| Mr. Green, are you with us? And welcome back to Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you. It's an honor to be here. I'm Gerald Green. My address is 8 Pilsner Street, Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| North Carolina 28804. I did say that, and it is a challenging piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| When this first came before the Planning Commission and planning staff, there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| proposal for a plan, a preliminary plan. There was no thought given to how to appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| develop this property. The staff imagined that the full one lot, single family lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| uniform lot sizes, three to four units per acre that we see throughout Knox County, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| not be appropriate for this property. We, as staff, recommended denial. The Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| I believe, also recommended denial, and the County Commission ultimately denied the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| rezoning, or were on track to deny the rezoning when it was withdrawn. We then met with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| Kennard, his staff, and proposed a more feasible development approach to this. And he listened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| which was unusual for a developer to listen to the planning staff. But he's preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| as he stated, 16 acres, not just the floodway, which cannot be built in, but also the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| which can be developed. So there will be more area to protect and absorb floodwaters than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| under a typical development proposal. He also proposed preserving the steeper slopes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| clustering the development with attached units on those slopes of 15 percent or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| And we had not seen that, we had not walked the property at that first time. So staff walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| the property and saw that it could be developed if appropriate measures were taken. And I do believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| as Mr. Ronju said, that this is a model for future development in Knox County, rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| cookie cutter approach of three, four, five units per acre, all single family homes. The standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| lot, scrape and level the area. I believe this is an appropriate approach for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| challenging sites and the sites that are even worse than this. I'm reminded of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| properties, some properties in Hardin Valley that have the same type of constraints that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| this property had, that this development proposal could be a model for. So yes, I did say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| but that with more information will change our mind. And if we don't accept challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| then we don't go anywhere. And this is a challenging site, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| by accepting the challenges that this site proposes or presents, Mr. Kennard has developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| a very feasible development plan and it's deserving of support as recommended by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| planning staff and by the Planning Commission. Thank you, Mr. Green. So it sounds like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| been a lot of communication between Mr. Randy and the Planning Commission. So I have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Mr. Randy Kennard. Have you reached out to the community at all to kind of do some updates? Have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| they been able to look at the land? Did you offer that to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| I think Commissioner Courtney Durrett could answer that, but we did try to reach out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| I don't think that she got any response. We were going to have a Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you, Ms. Lundy. Courtney, Commissioner Durrett, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| Okay. I did have a question for Mr. Kennard specifically. Do you know what Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| is planning to do with the donated floodway if we were to go that route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| I think it would be a similar project. I'm sorry that Carol Evans is not available. I didn't invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| her, but as I understand it, it was going to be a similar project as the Harold Road Park, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| has, I think, been renamed the Roy Arthur Park. Okay. There is a letter in the document from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=1992)|
| 0:33:23| Legacy Parks, but I don't know if it spells it out very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| It doesn't. It just says that there's been communication and that that land would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| donated to Legacy Park if this were to move forward. As far as the flooding, I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2015)|
| 0:33:45| are doing things or will do things in your plan to address flooding that would come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| construction and the building of houses on this property, but is there anything in your plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| address the current flooding or to at least attempt to mitigate it because, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| adding the potential for more flooding would exacerbate the problem tremendously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| We are required by law that the peak flow off of our property would be less after the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| than before it is. Okay. I guess my question is, are you, aside from addressing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2058)|
| 0:34:31| your property would be, the potential flooding your property would be creating by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| developing it, are you kind of going above and beyond or anything like that to attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| to address the current flooding that there is on this property right now or at the base of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| this property right now or in this floodway? Yes, I'd like to defer to Chris on that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| he could answer. Our plan was to go beyond what was required, but Chris, could you say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| on that, please? Yes, and I want to make it clear I'm not the design engineer for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| but I have discussed extensively the nature of the design. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| the goal, you know, what the team is trying to do is, in fact, add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| increase infiltration. I mean, sort of a net negative impact, which would be a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| impact, of course, with the development. And the discussion, and this is basically a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| engineering gobbledygook, but the discussion about it sounded very hopeful in that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| options that could be done. If the use of the floodplain area were similar to what is done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2148)|
| 0:35:57| Harrell Road, I assume most people at the meeting here are familiar with the Harrell Road Stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| Park or Roy Arthur, more aptly named Stormwater Park. There are opportunities to add additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2163)|
| 0:36:14| floodplain storage in this area. But, you know, expectations have to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2174)|
| 0:36:23| The system flooding that we all know, dumpsters floating down Broadway and trucks overturned and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| every, all of the destruction in the lower reaches of First Creek, that's major system flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| And it takes, there's no 80-acre site that's going to make that, that's going to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| But this is, this is a step. This is helpful. And I think it will be so in a quantifiable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2207)|
| 0:36:56| manner as well. So hopefully that answers your question without too much engineering speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Okay. Thank you. And Director Snowden, are you still here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2222)|
| 0:37:12| Yes, Commissioner Durd, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Some of the concerns that have been brought to my attention from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| are the curve that's right there. I travel this road frequently and I know exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| they're talking about. Is there site distance on this? And so two things, the site distance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| another one as was brought up by Mr. Taylor, the lawyer for the community, speaking in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| is the, if this were to flood, would he be able to put an entrance where there is flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2261)|
| 0:37:52| currently? Like they said, they could potentially get trapped in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| Yes, Commissioner. We looked at that. That was one of our, well, two of our concerns obviously was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| access. Should the road flood? And we feel like based on the frontage that Mr. Gerard has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| that he can establish an entryway that does allow safe ingress with a flood event, like what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| pictures indicate, as well as we feel like there's a cut bank there, cut slope that would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| modified, but it looks like it's within his frontage and he can confirm some of these, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| it looks like he could shave that bank back and achieve site distance. So those two concerns for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| us appears preliminarily like they could be resolved with his engineering team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Okay. Those are all the questions I have for right now. I will defer to other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| with questions. I need to unmute. Sorry about that. Thank you very much, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| You're up next. Yes. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. As the applicant indicated, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2338)|
| 0:39:11| commissioners did go out and tour the property, and I was one of them that did take them up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| his offer. And all I can say is I'm extremely grateful that I did. I too had driven that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| many times, and when you glance over to the right where that property is, it appears it would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2365)|
| 0:39:34| impossible build. This is just a layperson talking, but it did not take five minutes once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2374)|
| 0:39:43| I was back on the property to recognize, number one, what a beautiful piece of property it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| but also how much it truly does level and flatten once you kind of get over the initial hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2390)|
| 0:40:00| area. I do hear what the applicant has done in efforts to truly make this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2400)|
| 0:40:17| fit the land, so to speak. I was knocked off for a few minutes, so it may have already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| brought up as far as the type of homes that he is looking to build, the garage up, garage down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| type of homes that build directly into slopes, whether the slope is up or down, this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| thing that really we just don't see hardly at all in Knox County. And I was very, very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| by that. I also really liked the look of the floodplain area back there by the creek and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2445)|
| 0:40:57| fact that it will be donated and it will be turned into a stormwater park. Several of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2457)|
| 0:41:06| mentioned the Herald Stormwater, Roy Arthur Park, and it's in my district and I just attended the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2466)|
| 0:41:18| renaming of it a few months ago. And I will tell you, if you would have seen that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| before they turned it into a stormwater park, you would have never dreamed that this really very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| ugly piece of property could amount to anything that would be passing for something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| the community would be proud of. And I felt that very same feeling when I went back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| the property that would be in fact become part of a stormwater park, which not to mention can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| even be accessed right now because there is no development on the land. That's a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| piece of property that I think would be very beneficial to the community in general to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| able to access that. I would not have thought I would start out supporting this project, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| actually I do support it. I do think that the 2.51 is a reasonable ask and I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| I will be supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Commissioner Smith, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| COMMISSIONER SMITH Thank you, Mr. Chair. In reviewing the MPC file, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2549)|
| 0:42:39| noticed that these pictures are from February 23rd of 2019. I think it's pretty safe to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| whether you were on North Shore or Cedar Bluff, in 2019 and 2020, you had flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2568)|
| 0:43:01| Reading through it, I see, you know, the neighbors complaining of flooding. One person says two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| times in four years. Well, I would assume those are probably the two February's of 19 and 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| where our whole county was facing unprecedented flooding issues. So I guess my first question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| for Mr. Taylor. You had said it floods three or four times a year. Are there any more pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| to document that? MR. TAYLOR Not with me. On our website, if you look, there's pictures from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| number of different floods. And yes, it does flood two, three times a year. Some are worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| than others. But yes, that is correct. COMMISSIONER SMITH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| What is your flood site address? Your website address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2626)|
| 0:43:56| MR. TAYLOR I'm looking for it. I apologize. COMMISSIONER SMITH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Okay. Let me go ahead and ask Mr. Ganju a question. Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| it is conceivable with the right type of engineering and the right type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2645)|
| 0:44:14| that a property can actually yield less water into the water system than it currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| Is that correct? MR. GANJU Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2661)|
| 0:44:30| I think, yeah, that's correct, that it's conceivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| COMMISSIONER SMITH Okay. And have you seen, you said you were not the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2673)|
| 0:44:43| designer on this project. But have you seen the plans and are there anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| in it that you could explain to us that will help to achieve a yield that is less than what's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| right now? And the reason why I think that's important for that to be able to be achieved is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| people are concerned about the flooding. But if this person can demonstrate and show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| that they won't be adding to the flooding, you can't hold somebody else responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| for existing problems. MR. GANJU Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| So to explain that, and I hope you'll understand I don't want to put a friend and colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| in a tough position of promising something in his design that I don't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| But the engineer's approach is to provide infiltration areas specifically as water runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2740)|
| 0:45:50| off from the slope towards the development and then also for the development for the runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| generated by the development itself to use permeable paver systems, which I think actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| people are familiar with in the Knox County area for infiltration and really have a goal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2764)|
| 0:46:14| completely absorb on site any runoff generated by the change in land, by the change in land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| of the development. I'd be careful that I wouldn't say that expecting that it would reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2782)|
| 0:46:33| the runoff from how it is today. There's a lot of factors that can come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| and I've seen the design process of plans review firsthand for a long time. So a lot of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| happens. But I think that the goal of infiltrating the runoff that's generated by the change in land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2805)|
| 0:46:57| use is a reasonable goal. It's a challenge, like everybody said. But if you look around at what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| being proposed for development in Knox County, it's all a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2826)|
| 0:47:16| That website, if you're interested, is www.beverlyrezoning.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| Commissioner Smith, do you still have the floor? Do you have additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| You're muted. You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| Just, yes, you have questions, or no, you do not have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2856)|
| 0:47:48| You're still muted. I can't, we can't hear you. So I'm going to, I may come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| if you can jump back in, Commissioner Daley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Hello, Director Snowden. I go. Sorry, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2878)|
| 0:48:08| That's all right. It's Zoom. We're used to it. Is it not the case that a property owner has to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| equal to or less than the runoff that is currently flowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| That is correct, Commissioner. Mr. Gron's used exactly right. It's my department's job to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| sure that those downstream owners see no harm, and my staff would be diligent in that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| So, in other words, there's going to be no more water coming off that property now than it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| be in a year from now or two years from now. Give us the explanation. Can we use both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| or which would we use here, a retention or a detention bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| And I haven't seen design drawings, but from what Mr. Gron's is saying, they're doing infiltration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| which means the water doesn't leave the side. It actually goes into the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| which is retention and not detention. Okay. On this retention, Jim, will it be a 100-year flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2943)|
| 0:49:16| or the 500-year flood that's determined? How do you all determine which one we look at? We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| the 500-year flood back in February, was it, or last year? It depends on how you look at it. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2962)|
| 0:49:33| far as there was that preceding rain event, the storm itself was not that big, but time you added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| the moisture content of the soil prior to it probably did correlate about that. Yes, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| ensure that that flow was no greater at the 100-year mark. So, that's our threshold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| That's what I want to make sure of and let everyone know that the amount of water that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| coming off there now will not be any greater, and there's a possibility that it could be less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| but rest assured it will not be greater than what it is now. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3004)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Smith, are you able to unmute and jump back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| Yes, sir. I'm sorry I didn't lower my hand. No problem. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Snowden, when a permeable site with retention, I think is the word you used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3027)|
| 0:50:44| it uses a combination of spaces, pavers, and it does have a pond also, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| It can. Like I said, I haven't seen any specific plans for this site, but I think the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3052)|
| 0:51:03| that is doing the work had another location in Hardin Valley, and he used the combination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| pavers and a retention pond, so most likely it would be a combination of those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| Okay. Mr. Taylor, I was able to get to the site, and I see two sets of flooding photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| one from February 23rd and one from January 2020. Is that all the pictures, or am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3084)|
| 0:51:39| You're muted, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I apologize. I don't have the site up in front of me. I don't know for sure if that's all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| photos or that's just all that were put on the site. I did not construct the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| Okay. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Skinneker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| Thank you, Chairman Jay. I think one of the problems with the Zoom format is we miss out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| on the crowds that attended the previous commission meetings. I certainly can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| when this came up before that it was probably the largest crowd that we ever had for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| meeting that I've experienced. And so I guess this question is to Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| since this is your district, I kind of want to know what your feelings are on this rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| because you've been in contact with a lot of the neighbors and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you, Commissioner Skinneker. You're correct. I have been in contact with a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| specifically that live on Beverly Road, but also from those neighborhoods that Mr. Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| mentioned that are downstream of White's Creek and First Creek, Alice Bell, Emerland, Fairmont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| which coincidentally is where I grew up and can remember someone canoeing down Broadway from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| flooding in First Creek when I was young. So this is not my first go around with having to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| flooding issues in my life. And I've heard from all of them. Of course, they would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3199)|
| 0:53:29| nothing happen to this site, and they are aware that that is not possible now. And so their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| compromise would be for a one unit per acre recommendation. Okay, thank you. And then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3215)|
| 0:53:45| guess this question is for Gerald Green. We're constantly hearing from the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| affordable housing. Could you describe what, in your opinion, affordable housing is in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| And what kind of price ranges or construction standards? Yes, sir, I'll try. And affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| housing is defined as housing that someone can afford, expending 30 percent of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| So I think the median income, and just for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| first simple math state, I'm going to say that it's $45,000 a year in Knox County. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| pretty close. So that means spending $15,000 a year on housing, which is just over $1,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| and which I think would buy maybe a, I think my current interest rate's about a $200,000 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| So it's very challenging. We look beyond that to long-term costs and interest rates. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| housing will help the housing market in Knox County just by providing more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| And speaking with realtors before I left, I had lots of conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| Knoxville Area Association of Realtors and their former director about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| Just increasing the number of housing units available helps the affordability of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| by expanding the market and the number of homes available to people. This would address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| housing issue. And I don't know what the cost would be because the project is not far enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| long in its planning stage to really pinpoint the price of housing, but providing this number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| of units in this area would certainly help the market and therefore help the affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| of housing in Knox County. Okay. So basically less than $200,000 home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| is basically classified as affordable housing then? For those with a, at the median income level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| and then as you go up in the income, the affordability increases obviously. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| Okay. Thank you. I'll defer back to Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| I've heard the residents around there want one. I think it was approved for 2.5 on to know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| the owner, if there's any middle ground there between the two, or is the project not feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| at any lower rate is too acceptable or no? No, it wouldn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3387)|
| 0:56:39| We thought just that 172 is about our least number, which I'm sorry, I don't have that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| front of me what that 2, I think 2.36 is 184. I don't remember what 172 was. I'm sorry. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3406)|
| 0:56:58| have that in front of me. Commissioner Ward, did you? Okay. Commissioner Hill, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3418)|
| 0:57:16| Yes. Thank you. Mr. Gurnard, what did you say the price point of your homes would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3436)|
| 0:57:36| We're set up anywhere between 185 and 235 currently with that. And I did get that from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| there is a website, what is affordable housing in Knox County. And part of it was a payment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| 979 to 1510. But affordable housing is not just the house payment. It includes utility payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| and everything else in the house that we're building are very energy efficient. And so we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3478)|
| 0:58:07| tried to address affordability as a whole house cost, not just the cost of the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3487)|
| 0:58:18| but the utility cost and the upkeep cost and the maintenance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you. I'm not, well, I was going to say I've not seen other hands. Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| have you spoken? Yes, ma'am. Oh, I was going to just go ahead and move forward and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| that we accept the recommendation by the planning staff. Commissioner Biggs, do you want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| first before any motions are made? I just had just a couple of quick questions, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| if that's okay with you. Sure. Yeah. If that's okay, Mr. Hill, I just want to give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| an opportunity to get everything answered. Commissioner Biggs, go ahead. Yes, sir. Earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Director Snowden said that he believes that we could clear out that hill, basically scale back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| some on the hill for grading for the line of sight distance. I was trying to look it up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| Is that going to be like another retention wall or what is that going to be? I know we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| into the zoning, but I'm trying to find something just because I'd hate to see a train coming. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| do we know when trains come through there? I mean, are we going to back up traffic and maybe have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| rearing collisions or what? I'm trying to look at that as well online, and I don't really see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| that much about that. Sure, Commissioner Biggs. You know, that's one of the things until we kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| of know a density assigned to the property, it's hard for us to really make, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| a really informed decision on how much traffic is coming to the site and then making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| on what off-site improvements we may need in regard to does it need a turn lane, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| a left end or a right end. So, some of those questions are really kind of hard for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| specify without knowing a density and hence a number of trips that will be generated from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3608)|
| 1:00:17| Okay. I appreciate that, Director Snowden. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| I also see Commissioner Durrett's hand up. So, Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3620)|
| 1:00:29| Commissioner Hill, you want to defer to her right now for a second? Okay. Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My hand was actually up to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| to her motion if that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| I think who wants to make a motion? There is no motion on the floor right now. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| Commissioner Hill, you started to talk about one, but Commissioner Durrett has a substitute. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| want to? I'm okay. You can go either way. You started to make one, but we didn't make one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| because you deferred. So, what would you like to do, Commissioner Hill? Well, I will defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| District 2. Okay. Commissioner Durrett, then there is no motion currently on the table. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| happy to entertain a motion to begin the process. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Commissioner Hill, for deferring to me. Like I said, the community has really expressed their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3681)|
| 1:01:32| concerns about the flooding that this can potentially cause and exacerbate the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| flooding that is there right now. And as we've spoken, it doesn't only affect the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| surrounding community of this property, but it can have a greater potential of flooding downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| to First Creek. And so, with that being the people's voice, I want to recommend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| one, a move forward with a one unit per acre density on this development. So, to restate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| motion would be to approve a one unit per acre? Correct. Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| Second. Second by Commissioner Ward. I see Commissioner Daly's hand up regarding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| motion. Yeah, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we go with the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| of 2.51 dwelling units per acre. Okay. There's a substitute motion by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| to approve as outlined at 2.51. Is there a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| I second. Second by Commissioner Lundy on the substitute motion. So, we must take action on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| the substitute motion first before considering the original motion. Is there a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| on the substitute motion at approval of 2.5? Commissioner Durrett, do you have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| on this particular item or just your hand still up from prior? Okay. Thank you very much. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3781)|
| 1:03:08| a discussion on the substitute motion by Commissioner Daly? Okay. We'll now do a roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| call vote on the substitute motion for Commissioner Daly at 2.51 approval as outlined in the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3792)|
| 1:03:21| recommendation. Seeing no further discussion, Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| call the vote on the substitute motion? Everybody clear on what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3808)|
| 1:03:38| Commissioner Butt, yes? Okay. Commissioner Hill? Yes. Commissioner Hill votes aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3818)|
| 1:03:47| Bussler? Yes. Mr. Bussler votes aye. Commissioner Behler? Passed. You said passed? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| passed. Yes, I'm sorry. Commissioner Behler votes aye. No. I passed. I'm sorry. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| Behler passes. Commissioner Daly? Aye. Commissioner Daly votes aye. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Aye. Commissioner Jay votes aye. Commissioner Biggs? Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| Commissioner Biggs, pass. Commissioner Lundy, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| Commissioner Lundy votes aye. Commissioner Durette, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Commissioner Durette votes no. Commissioner Smith, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner Smith votes aye. Commissioner Ward, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Commissioner Ward passes. And Commissioner Schoonmaker, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no. Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| Do any of the passes wish to vote? Sorry, I said no. I didn't hit the mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| I'm sorry. Okay, I see a no from Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| Commissioner Ward, do you wish to keep a pass or change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| I'll keep my pass. Okay, Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| Okay. So, Commissioner Biggs, you're still passing? Are you voting? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| So, we have six aye votes, two no votes, and three passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| And the substitute motion and approval at 2.51 passes with six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| That was a no. I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, Chairman. Okay, Commissioner Biggs, would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| have a pass vote or a no vote? No vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Okay. So, we have six aye votes, two no votes, and two passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| Okay. The motion passes with six votes, aye, three, no, two, pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| And that completes item number 49. Good luck with your project, and thank you all for participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| We're going to, I'm going to continue on. We have two other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| No, we have more than two other items. Soldering out, I'm going to return back to item number 48,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| though. Our participants are with us on 48. I apologize for the technical difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| as we started our zoning meeting. We'll go back to item number 48. Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| could you please recall that one? And then we have our applicant, Ms. Hermosillo, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3976)|
| 1:06:25| opposition, Mr. Butler and Ms. Smith, with us. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Okay. This is item 1-D-21-RZ, request of Savannah Hermosillo for rezoning from A Agricultural to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=3989)|

| 1:06:47| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Sorry for the cough. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| Please say the applicant is present. Yes, the applicant is present. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| Is there opposition, Mr. Butler or Ms. Smith? Let's see if you are here. Mr. Butler? Ms. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4020)|
| 1:07:14| Do we have anybody waiting in the waiting room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4034)|
| 1:07:22| Negative. Okay. We do have the applicant here. If you would, Ms. Amy Brooks from Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4042)|

| 1:08:07| So I am planning on to have a mobile home built for my property. I'm currently living on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4087)|
| 1:08:16| another mobile home here with my mom and disabled cousin. So mom's getting a little bit older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| I plan on living here and building a place for myself to stay and help out. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| very much. Thank you. Is there discussion on this item? And is there any opposition that's joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| us? Commissioner Skinmaker? Thank you, Chairman Jay. I was just going to make a point of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4116)|
| 1:08:45| that when the Commissioner makes the motion regarding this, since we did kind of jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| around, that they do include the file number. Since the clerk didn't read it. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| We'll read that in the motion. Any further discussion on item number 48? This is item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| number 48, 1-D-21-RZ. Seeing no further discussion, I'll look to the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4146)|
| 1:09:16| representative, Commissioner Hill, for a motion. Yes, thank you. I have talked to Ms. Hermosillo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4156)|
| 1:09:25| and also talked to a couple of the neighbors of the subdivision next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| Their plan for this is just to merely add another home, even though it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| I think the concern was that the ask was four per acre. And this is a long narrow strip that's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| would not be practical for any other type of development. So I was very glad to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| Savannah and get clarity that she's just merely wanting to live close to her mama. So I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4197)|
| 1:10:06| make a motion to approve this as recommended. Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| Second. Second by Commissioner Durrett, I believe. Is that correct? No. Commissioner Lundy. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| Okay. Commissioner Lundy. Is that correct? Correct. Yes. Okay. Commissioner Lundy on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| second. Is there additional discussion on item number 48? Seeing none, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| please call the roll. And let's go ahead and identify the item number as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| Well, the item number is 1-D-21-RZ. And I'll begin the roll call with Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4241)|

| 1:11:28| Thank you. That motion is approved. And good luck with your project and taking care of your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| Thank you so much. All right. Thank you very much, Madam Clerk. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| Next item is the request of Taylor D. Forster for rezoning from RA Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| and CA General Business to A Agricultural. The property is located at 1508 East Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| John Sevier Highway. Parcel ID is 111048 in the 9th Commission District. And the item number is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| 1-H-21-RZ. Okay. Thank you very much. Is the applicant present? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4321)|
| 1:12:12| Okay. Is there opposition to this item? I did not have any listed, but I will call for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4332)|
| 1:12:21| Okay. Seeing none, if you would, Ms. Brooks, please give us the planning recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| Certainly. Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve A Agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| for the portion of the property zoned RA Low Density Residential because it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| with the South County Sector Plan Agricultural and Hillside Protection designation by vote of 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| to 0. Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Applicant, if you could identify yourself with your name and address and tell us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| about your project. Taylor Forster, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, suite S-700,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919. Can you hear me? It's really low, so just really let yell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| Yeah. Sorry. Just to make sure we're clear, this is for the portion that is currently zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4384)|
| 1:13:14| It does not include the commercial portion of the project, which is the lesser nominal amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| of acreage there. As for the request, the request is to go from RA to Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| The applicant or the client is looking for, not exactly settled on what exactly wants to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| the property. Thought the Agricultural zoning definitely was the best option to proceed under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| some of the thoughts or ideas that he has and the fact that it complies with the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| Considering that and following staff recommendation and the Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| vote of recommendation would ask that you approve the rezoning from RA to Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Forster. Is there any discussion amongst the commissioners? Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| questions? Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Chairman Jay. It's very unusual that someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4445)|
| 1:14:15| has an RA designation for almost 80 acres would switch over to Agricultural. Usually it's vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| versa. So you have no idea at this point in time what the applicant desires to use for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| approximately 80 acre track? Well, going for the Agricultural designation, there are certain tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| credits that are available. There has been discussions of some agritourism possible type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| use and there have been discussions of planting it and doing single family lots. But there just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| is no exact determination at this time. Okay. And are we going to, I'm assuming we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| hear from Commissioner Daly for his insight on this property? Yes, sir. And you're up next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4498)|
| 1:15:06| Commissioner Daly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great leading, John. This property is there across from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| Ninus Plants and there's a little small piece of commercial property, probably two acres or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| not very much at all. I'm glad to see that this is going to go back to Agricultural because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| it's RA, there's two ridges there with the TVA power line running down through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| I don't think that this would be a great property to do an RA on anyway because of the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4534)|
| 1:15:42| and the deep 2D pollers that goes through there. Not much less to say that it's a great deer hunting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| site. There's a lot of people deer out there. I can prompt you there. Pass by there, go to church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| and they're there. But Taylor's right. It is a, I think it's a prime to go down to Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4554)|
| 1:16:03| not only for to save the hillsides and the top and the trees and it would be a great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| it would be okay for to put 10, 12, 20 houses on there without destroying the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| And in the future, if it's, and it is in the sector plan, in the future, if the new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| want to come back and rezone it to RA or PR, they have that opportunity. But I am more than thrilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| and so are the neighbors, Taylor, to make the motion that we approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4590)|
| 1:16:38| Plannings Plan Residential, I'm sorry, approve Agricultural zoning for this portion. And it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| only the portion except for the commercial zone. That's correct. First by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| is there a second? Second. I'll go with Commissioner Schoonmaker on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| because he got his little hand light still on. So, we have a first by Commissioner Daley and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| a second by Commissioner Daley to, Commissioner Schoonmaker to approve as recommended. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| any further discussion on item number 50? Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| If you could, so the microphone is messed up again. Angie, if you could jump in and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| do the roll call. It was just sounded like the robot again came back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4650)|

| 1:17:46| Aye. Commissioner Lundy votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Commissioner Durant. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Commissioner Durant votes aye. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4671)|

| 1:19:10| Mr. Walton or representative of Mr. Walton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4750)|

| 1:19:18| Anyone in the waiting room? IT team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4758)|
| 1:19:29| Negative. Commissioner Bailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| any indication that we would not have a representative tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| You are muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| Sorry, Mr. Chairman. No, I have not heard from the applicant, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| rather unusual. At a 7-to-5 vote, I really expected that the applicant would reach out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| but I've not heard anything. Perhaps a friendly suggestion would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| make a motion to move forward to just move it, defer it till next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| I'll make that motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| Point of order, please. Yes, sir. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| We're not to the last item on the agenda, right? We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| This is the last item? 51 and 52 are together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| It's the same applicant. Same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Never mind. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Schoonmaker on the second, Commissioner Bailer, the motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| to defer for 30 days. This would appear on our March agenda. Is that clear what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| Well, Mr. Chairman, can I include the next item in the motion if the clerk wants to read it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| the record? Yes. If you could read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Madam Clerk, and then we'll do a motion together for 51 and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| Mr. Chairman, point of order. I don't think, I think we automatically roll them anyway according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| to our rules to the next month. We can ask the law director if we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| Hold on. Sorry. Let me just, you may be right. Let me just look real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Yeah, if the applicant is not present when the item is reached, it should be placed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| commission agenda for the following month. You're correct. So we do not need a motion or a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| or a roll call vote. So, is there any more business that has come before the zoning meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| Yes, I'd like to, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4882)|

| 1:21:32| Yes, sir. And here you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Hey, you know, back, I guess, November, December, when we were meeting, we had the discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| we had applicants not showing up, and we were going to discuss looking to make sure that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| know that when they leave there, that they're supposed to show up. Has anything been done on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| that yet? We have, for at least the last several years, notified applicants that they needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4910)|
| 1:21:59| attend the next legislative hearing. So that's something that we do. And back in, I believe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| was, I was looking back at the, because there was that change in commission policy in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| as well, that Drusilla shared with me, and we changed our notification based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| The gentleman that was in South Knoxville rushed in at Christmas time, I'm pretty sure it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| December meeting, and he didn't realize that he needed to be there. My question is, can we stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| an orange sheet of paper there that says, you must appear before the next legislative meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4948)|
| 1:22:36| Is that possible? Is that asking too much? No, it's definitely not asking too much. And I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| say, I will double check to make sure that our staff are still doing something similar. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| previously, we were sticking, I don't know if it was green, it was a bright colored piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| where we would mail people information. But we do our best to try to remind them on a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| of different fronts at the time of application. And then once the Planning Commission has acted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| but I'll follow up, Commissioner Daly. Yeah, you do. Y'all do a great job. It's just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| the ones that only come before us one time in their lifetime, they do not know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| So thank you very much. You're welcome. Okay. Is there any additional business to come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| zoning meeting? Okay. Seeing none, a motion to adjourn the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| So moved. Second. Commissioner Behler and Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/zoning-210222?start=5003)|
