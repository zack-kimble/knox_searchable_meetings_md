| 0:00:00| The 15% doesn't change with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| It's a map that is based on more up-to-date topographic information using GIS that can clearly identify those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:19| So if it doesn't affect it, why do we bring it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:21| I mean, Sevier County has got to have more terrain to protect than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=21)|
| 0:00:28| And I think they started at 30% as far as ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| They have more ridgetops to protect than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| I mean, they don't have bigger landmass, but they've got more ridgetops to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| So why did they start at 30% and we go down to 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| The policies that they adopted for 30% and above are very similar to our 25% and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| They chose 30% and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| I'm not sure exactly why, but it was one-third of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:53| Why did we go down to 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| I guess that's my main question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| Why did we go to 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| The answer to that is we've been using 15% to 25% and 25% and above since the 1990s as a basis of these zoning recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:10| and are recommending that that practice be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| The Sevier County regulations that were put in place are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| and it deals with an average slope of 30% or more so that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| a parcel could have areas on it that are flat that are impacted by the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| It's an average slope versus virtually a pixel-by-pixel analysis that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| How come we can't go on a parcel-by-parcel basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| What's the holdup there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| I mean, why do we have to have this big blanket of slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| I mean, I'm all for it. Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| I think we've made some mistakes in Knox County on our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| but why do we have to blanket one-third or one-fourth of the county and not just look at each area differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| Like, Eddington Road was a perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| I mean, Eddington Road is a perfect example of them using the flat part as much as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| reforesting what they took out if they took out anything, and it didn't require any special plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| It was approved under the planned residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| and the parcel just to the south of the retreat is the example that we gave in the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| In that particular parcel, the development is up on top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Well, Cherokee Bluffs is on top of the ridge, but it's a beautiful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Right. Well, so we have two side-by-side apartment projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| one of which was developed at the base of the slope, the other of which was developed on the top of the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| where the flatland happened to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| If I could, Commissioner McKenzie and Commissioner Wright, would you mind holding your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| Because we're going to need to vacate this room in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I'd like to go ahead and hear from some of the folks that are here, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| You're going to have plenty of time to answer your questions, and we're going to take all the time we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| But again, I know we have to vacate the room, and I'd like to go ahead and start hearing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| We started at 412, so I'm cognizant of the minutes, and I want to make sure that everybody's treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| So those of you who would like to make a presentation or comments, please feel free to come forward, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| We'll begin with you, and if you give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| My name is Lonnie Harris. I live at 2535 Old Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| It's right next to the infamous Tim Graham development that has been brought up in this argument for a number of months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:38| Tony, I'd like to address one thing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| If you'd be willing to give us $300,000 of tax money that you guys used to make this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| I believe we would be more than happy to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| You took $300,000 of our money to try to take our rights away from us to please you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| That doesn't suit us real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Now, let me give you a little story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| I've got two neighbors of mine, Dennis and Diane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| They had their property up for sale when Tony and Joe started all this crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| They had a prospective buyer on it until all this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| They had to pull it off the market because they couldn't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Dennis is now dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| The house is down from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| There's another friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| He's now dead. He died the day before yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| They had intended to put their house on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| They couldn't put it on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| They're going to be right across the street from commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| They couldn't put it on the market because Tony and Joe got this $300,000 albatross started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| to try to take people's rights away from them because Tony wants to look at the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Well, now let me make you aware of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| There are several hundred thousand more acres of trees in Tennessee now than there were in 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| And it keeps growing every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| We don't have a shortage of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Furthermore, when I bought my property, I bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| I didn't buy the property next door to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I didn't buy the property behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| I didn't buy the trees on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I didn't buy the dirt on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| I bought my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Nobody else bought mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Now, I'm a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| And if any of you guys are familiar with the Tennessee Right to Farm Act, be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I can cut every tree on that property down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| I can grade it down to make it usable for farm use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| And there's not a thing in the world you can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Now, if this thing goes through and any of these other homeowners or landowners here want to cut their trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| I can put you in contact with some people that will do it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| That's about all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I'm Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| I'm with the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| At the risk of being a Johnny-come-lately into this issue, we did wait until after NPC completed its report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| because as we followed it, it did take a whole lot of different nicks and turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| And things that sounded like they were going to be really draconian in the spring did get resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| And there's a lot of stuff that we think are very positive in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| First of all, let me say unequivocally, whether it's the three major ridges or the seven major ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| we think that you all could not move quick enough to protect the ridgetops in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=411)|
| 0:07:01| But you really need to set an elevation that's going to make sense and not any summit of anything that has any elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:12| And I think you all saw some of that at Park West Hospital last summer when, obviously, that was not Shark's Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:21| I spent some time trying to figure out how to do a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| And I apologize for this, but to do a visual aid and ended up going to Julia Lawyer, who's in kindergarten at Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:43| Luckily for me, her mom is an advanced math teacher at Bearden, but this is 50 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| This is a no-brainer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| I mean, you know, we know that 50 percent is, you know, you can just take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| Sevier County is 30 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| And I'm not, I've been in development, but, you know, I think that that could be argued either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| But the truth of the matter is what they're trying to do in Sevier County to protect things like Wares Valley and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:26| I'm glad they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| I'm glad that MPC, Tony, Joe, everybody else who spent so much time on this thing has done it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| It is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| However, that's 15 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| And our point at the chamber is that we believe that 15 percent, whether we've always done it or we're talking about doing it now, is a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:55| We don't believe that that level of slope is going to be a detriment in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=535)|
| 0:09:04| The part that concerns us is that this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| It's all it is is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| And if you adopt it, the plan will be, the protection plan will go into place and just like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| but there's going to be following the plan a set of regulations that will have a form of ordinances that will dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:32| and determine how that plan is going to be executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| We don't, we're not comfortable, and I understand it's never been done this way, but we've never done a slope protection before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| We think that if you're going to adopt a plan, then adopt a plan contingent upon you later adopting the regulations that go along with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=587)|
| 0:10:00| so you can look at the two and see if you can live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Don't adopt a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Have it in place and then deal with the regulations later, even though it's never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| The issue on the notices, if we've had a gazillion public, if you think about the number of public hearings we have every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:30| about every issue, be honest with yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| How many people are actually paying attention to what's going on in public meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| They're just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| It's easy for us to think they are because that's where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| But if there were more people who knew who the vice president of the United States was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| or that Egypt is in the middle of, you know, I'd feel a lot better about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| But the truth of the matter is there's a whole lot of people who do not know this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| And it's not developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| It is property owners that have been around a good while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| And I will tell you this, they have not got a clue what the slope of their land is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| And if you're liking it to a sector plan, a sector plan is two dimensional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| You're looking at it and you know you live on Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| You can put your finger there and you say, well, yeah, I'm in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| On a slope protection, you have no idea because you don't know, even if you're looking at a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and even if you think you can understand grades and stuff, you really don't understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| But more than likely you're not going to look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| That's why we think that it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And this is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| It's an example that has come up since our board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| People could easily have pledged their property as collateral for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| That property could become considered to be devalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| They need to know that in advance before this happens so that at least you all have the benefit of hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:21| from people who are other than those of us who are very core central to this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:30| And the last thing I want to say is just the issue of the property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| With all due respect, with the issue of the property taxes, what that told is what could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| if you all agreed to rezone whatever came in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| It doesn't talk about what would happen otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| And this is not a reason to vote for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| If, like this is an arbitrary number, if ten cents on the tax rate would raise a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=776)|
| 0:13:06| these are wrong numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| then once you contract your tax base, however much, that ten cents may now need to be 13 cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:24| in order to get to that million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| And it's not going to be on the area that could have been developed, whether it should have been developed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| The last time we had a property tax increase was Tommy Shumpert's first year of his second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| We've been able, arguably, to avoid a tax increase because this county has been able to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| Now, if you go this route and there is a constriction of the tax rate, whatever that amount is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=833)|
| 0:14:02| that money does not become burdened on those properties that have the protection layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| It becomes a burden on West Hills and Beverly Acres, Martha Washington Heights, and, of course, commercial and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| It is that the part that not the reason to do it, and it's not the reason not to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| but you need to know that in order to make a knowledgeable decision about something that has this far-ranging effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| And the only other final thing, and I know I've been right, absolutely, there have been cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| we need to have a slope protection, we need to have something that's much more aggressive than we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| The second, the only thing I would say as a caveat, is that the city that is judged to be the most livable city in the United States now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:57| and can make me puke, for two years or until the last three years, Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| And if you didn't have slope protection, I mean, if you didn't have slope development there, there wouldn't be a Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you all for letting me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Anyone else like to address us on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Yes, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| My name is Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I live at 1476 Lyons Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| And I'm a real estate developer and kind of found out about this slope thing when the Parkwest Hospital was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| I was involved in that sale, and this about killed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| And, you know, back to the issue of notice, real quick, the family that owned that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| they had no idea what was going on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| They were shocked to think that their property could have been impacted, the old family farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| by something that they were completely unaware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| And I think you're going to see that a lot if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I had a specific question on, I don't know if you guys have this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Do you have the plan up there that's been submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| The plan that's being submitted is supposed to start at 15% and regulate properties 15% and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| But on the chart, 30% of the property in the protected area is under, is between zero and 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=969)|
| 0:16:18| It's 38,000 acres that are between zero and 15% are restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| And I was just curious, how does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| If anybody can answer that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Mr. Carberry, could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Within the hillside area, you could imagine that the model that Mike was showing you as far as the ruler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| that's not how our hillsides are characterized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| They undulate in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So within the hillside area that's shown on any one parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| you could have areas that are zero to 15% on benches within the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| also on ridgetops, and some of them are rounded ridgetops and some of them are very sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| And that's the portion of the area within the hillside area that explains that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| So it starts at 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| You've got 30% of the protected area that is between zero and 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| And then from 15% to 25% is another 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| So 62% of the property that's being restricted from development is below 25% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| I mean, that's just, I feel like we met with Joe and we met with Tony about eight months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| a group of developers, and we told them we were completely in favor of protecting the scenic ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| but this thing has gotten so overreaching, the property has a little slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| and then tables off to a nice, flat, usable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| They've grabbed that whole area now and it's off limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| And, you know, that's our problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| We're not opposed to protecting scenic ridges, and we're totally supportive of something in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| but this is really overreaching, and I would encourage you guys to please strongly consider changing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| or revisiting this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Anyone else like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Hi, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| This is pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Look right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| It's already identified for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| It's been sitting on that wall for God knows how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| The area you see in purple is the area that we all agree should be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| The development community as a whole would strongly support the 30% and greater slope that Sevier County did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| and how we can continue to take this from the ridgetops, the purple areas that you see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| and blend it down to 15% and, in the case Scott Smith is referring to, 0%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| encompassing 204 square miles of land in Knox County, affecting over 131,000 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| and 60,000 plus different parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| This is a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| This is something we should all be concerned about, and believe it or not, this is the health care plan all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| Do we really want to go down that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| As it relates to this plan, believe it or not, I'm an activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Tony's an activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Joe's an activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| In my opinion, this plan should be taken out of the hands of the activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| You all should remand this back to MPC, put it in the hands of professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| When Sevier County did their plan, they hired a group to review the plan before they voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| Remand this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Have MPC put together a committee of professionals, not activists, review the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:12| review the positive and negative ramifications, the long-term impact to the county economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| the long-term impact to the tax base, the long-term impact of property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| send it back to MPC, a committee of professionals, allow them to review the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| and then bring it back to this body after a group of professionals has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| I think to do otherwise would be grossly irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| If I was presenting a plan with $350,000 in budgetary money, I could probably convince you of my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:50| and I think that is, in fact, what's happened prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Why we wouldn't send it back to a group, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| You would have to answer for yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Mr. Jarrett, and all due respect to you, sir, the plan that we're referring to doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| They keep referring to a plan that this is very comparable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Have any of you all seen that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Have you been able to compare the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| You have not been able to do because there is not a plan that exists that they keep referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| that this is very consistent with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Ask yourselves, have you seen that other plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| And, Mr. Jarrett, the reason I was coming back to you, sir, is they, today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| are trying to use a, quote, plan that really doesn't exist for regulatory purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| which does impact property owners and their value of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| So, subsequently, it does come down to a taking when the plan becomes a regulatory hammer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| by which to impact property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| When you get to that point, the plan then becomes a potential taking of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| I know this has been a tough issue for everybody, and this is not something we should take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| This is something we need to seriously consider, study all the ramifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| send it back to that body I spoke of, and once that body comes back with their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| and not the recommendations of extremists, then we proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| Yes, name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| I'm the infamous Tim Graham, 7010 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Tony, I'd like you to read this instead of me, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| I was asked just to shed a little light about our Callahan Road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| and two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| When we developed that property in the late 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| we transported about 250,000 cubic yards of dirt to facilitate and build the new Callahan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:09| in conjunction with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| That resulted, because we owned the property, because the county didn't have to pay for the dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| didn't have to load the dirt, and didn't have to haul it in trucks, they were able to pan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:27| It was a substantial savings, anywhere from a million and a half to two million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| just in savings on using that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Of course, the result of using that property is now approximately 500,000 to 600,000 square feet of retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:50| We built the Lowe's and the new Callahan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and because of the dirt being removed, it made the site more marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| So a few years later, Tim Harris comes along with Knox Wholesale Furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| and builds a new state-of-the-art 150,000 square foot furniture store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Now, a lot of people that live in North Knoxville appreciate the fact that they don't have to go to West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| to buy their furniture now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| His sales are about twice what he expected to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| and I think it's just because it was a need that needed to be met there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| In summary, our project at Crown Point, as I mentioned, is about a half a million square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Actually, if you count Mr. Harris, it's about 600,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| It's about a $50 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| The retail sales we estimate from the stores in just our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| not counting the Walmart or not counting like Home Depot or Marshall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| or some of those that came because that road was built, are about $130 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| That results in local sales tax of about $3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| The property taxes alone on just our project are $500,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| So that's about $3.5 million going to Knox County budget each year from just Crown Point Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| which is Kroger, Target, Lowe's, Knox Wholesale Furniture, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| And, of course, it's resulted in thousands of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| So I don't know if that's bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| I've heard it's been called bad development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| but it sounds like we need some more of this bad development, especially in this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Lastly, we're real proud of our most recent restaurant in North Knoxville, which is Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| I think a lot of people have been here and a lot of people waiting in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And, of course, they're doing tremendous business there, and we enjoy the good prices and the good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1549)|
| 0:26:00| What you should note is, of course, we haven't finished paving the road down below it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| but that is a 30% slope, a 33% slope on the back of Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| Now, I'm not sure this slope, because it was a built slope, would apply in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| but it could if you reversed it and put the restaurant into a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| If it was built into a hillside, you may have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So, nevertheless, there's two good examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Knox Wholesale Furniture and Cheddar's that are using a 30% to 33% slope in their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| If we could, I'd like to hear from one more person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| So, Wes, if you want to come down or whoever, and then we're going to need to move next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| You're going to have an opportunity to speak to us, so we're not going to cut you off or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| but we've got to vacate this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So, Mr. Stowers, if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Wes Stowers, 8733 Inlet Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| I'm a member of the MPC, and my name was not on that slide because I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| I've been deeply involved with this process for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| and what got my interest stirred was the Park West project that was initially turned down by MPC based upon this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| Fortunately, this body at the Knox County Commission overruled MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| I think it was a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| But this was one example that sparked my interest in some of the problems this plan could have if it was enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| I first want to say that it also passed MPC after several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| It was a messy process, and even some of those who ultimately voted in favor of it had serious concerns about the 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| I think everybody's in agreement that Commissioner Norman, Joe Hulquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| and those that worked on this have the best interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| They believe in what they did, and there's many parts of this plan that I think would have universal support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| as they address protecting the ridge lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| No one wants to damage the scenic vistas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| But my concern is that it's no longer a ridge top protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| It's a massive, it's morphed into a massive land use policy that will overlay, as we already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| over a third of the county, 60,000 property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| And my observation through this entire process is that it's been developed by too narrow a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| The task force initially included a cross section of folks from building, trades, development, construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| But by the end of the game, those folks had been frozen out and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Looking through the plan, I saw pictures in it that were depicted trying to be as representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| when in fact they were already in violation of existing ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| We have ordinances in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We sometimes have poor enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Some of the pictures in it were not even from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| To date, I haven't heard of any, I have had no one from the building, trades, construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| development, engineering backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| There may be some, but none of them have contacted me in favor of this plan as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| The key sticking point, I think as we already know, is the 15% rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| That's not a steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I think it's overused under our current rule, but that's another subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| If this plan simply went back to protecting ridge tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| if it mirrored what Sevier County has recently enacted and used 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| I don't even think we'd be debating this here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| But instead, what this has turned into is something that overlays a third of that map up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| and it's no longer a ridgeline protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| In closing, I think we need to go back and review this by a panel that includes input from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| who actually will have to make this plan work, and that's the development, building, construction, engineering communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| They need to have a stake at the table, and currently almost universally oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| We either scale this back or we need to call it exactly what it is, and it's not a ridge top plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| It's a land use overlay that will, again, cover a third of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| If we do that, I strongly support notifying everybody individually it owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| It is a property rights issue, and I would be very careful, past as it is today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| for the unintended consequences that will spur debate about it for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| And ladies and gentlemen, again, I apologize for having to leave this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| but city council is going to be here in about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| We're just going to take about a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| We're going to move next door to the small assembly room, and we will continue the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| Satisfied to be living on that more than 15% grade, they would tell you yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Bridgemore in deep west Knoxville, beautiful views of the mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and one of the most majestic developments I've ever seen done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I'm not going to name the bad ones, but drive around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and I can show you some dead, flat pieces of property that are just ugly and did not do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| And as a builder and a developer and a representative of our industry, we'll admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| There are some things out there that have happened that should not have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| but there's no correlation between grade and a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| So if you took that 15% and rolled it backwards, what would not be on the tax rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| A lot of the good property that's out there, and it does have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| And one of the broader statements that's being made is if this plan is truly going to be taken back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| and looked at by MPC, you have got to have people on that committee that do this for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| Because it comes down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| It comes down to the fact that it's got to be economically viable before we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| And I'll tell you specifically, I bought a piece of property that's 57 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I'm about two-thirds of the way finished with it when the economic downturn hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| And it was 57 acres of kudzu and highly visible kudzu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| And I can tell you that everybody that comes on that piece of property likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Joe Holquist has been to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I don't think he would say it's a bad piece of property because it was implemented properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| If you go door-to-door and talk to my homeowners, they're going to tell you that they like living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| And they're going to tell you they don't have runoff, they don't have banks sliding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| that this is a great piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| But if I had lost 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 lots, you'd have 57 acres of kudzu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| zoned agriculture with very little tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| So I really urge you to look at this and to get some professionals back on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| with the folks that have been on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| When I read those names, I didn't see a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I'm in the development industry. I'm in the real estate industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I didn't see a whole lot of people that are out there making their living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So I would urge you to get some folks on there that have to do this for a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| and take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And look at it from the point of view that it's not the grade, it's the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| Yes, sir. Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Gary Norvell, 4334 Paper Mill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| I'm a consulting engineer in Knox County as well as Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| In surrounding counties, we have an office here in Knoxville and one in Sevierville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| I have served on the task force, and I think everybody probably has received my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| I just recently asked to be taken off the task force for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| I wrote a very specific letter as to what those reasons are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| and I think I've emailed it to everybody so you'd have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I'm going to highlight some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Some of them have already been touched on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| so I'm going to try to skip over those so I don't repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| But I would encourage you, if you would, to read that letter because it has a lot of detail in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| But specifically, I have to say, I guess, that I've been a part of the development community for 38 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| Basically, my entire life, with the exception of a couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| my dad was a pharmacist and spent in Madisonville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| The rest of my life has been in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I've grown up, I've got not only a degree in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| but also a degree in forestry, both from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| And that degree in forestry came about because I obviously have an interest in trees and aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| But I feel like that during that 38 years, we have tried as a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| I'm a member of a firm that's been in existence since 1954,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| and we've tried to do what we can and provide projects that are positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| And I'm not saying that everything that we've done, like Mike said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| we've had some things through the years too that might not have turned out so well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| but we have always strived to be responsible in everything that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| nearly everything we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| And I feel proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| I've spent my life and depended upon the housing industry to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| And one thing about the committee, there were several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| I listed seven different reasons in my letter as to why I felt like it was time for me to pull off the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| and not be a member anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| And the first one has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| Mike totally kind of touched it when he made some of his opening remarks, and it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Look at the composition of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| There were, of the 23 or so people, I could count roughly about six people that had interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| in the same direction that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Whereas, if you look at the interest of the remaining people on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| which would be approximately 17 or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| we've got Tennessee Clean Water Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| and people like that where I think we've been kind of painted as being far this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| I think if you look at the rest of the committee for the majority, it's pretty much far the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| And that was something that kind of bothered me from the start, but I thought it was best to stay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| But like I say, I finally got to the point when some comments were made a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:33| that the development community was in favor of this, when actually they are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| and I felt it was time to pull off the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| In looking at, I think, something that hadn't been touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I've had the opportunity with an office in Sevierville to do a number of developments in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| I've had the opportunity to use those regulations, those hillside regulations that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| The 30% rule was mentioned, and I hadn't even thought about this until it was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| That is true. They use an average slope for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| which makes it very easy to work in between when you have a combination of steep and flat and steep and flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:23| Because you're looking at an average and not bringing the whole thing in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| then it's a whole different situation as far as how you can use those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| They are very effective with the way they're written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| I've also used the Gatlinburg regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We've had the opportunity to design a condominium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| and the way those regulations work, they say we want to preserve the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:53| and we want to preserve the vegetation in the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| and this is how we would like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| But if you don't do that, then this is what you can do to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| and make it not look like you've done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| and they give you actual guidelines as to how to go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Those things are very good regulations to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| and I felt all along that with them being in the adjoining county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| with basically the same interests of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| their terrain obviously is a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| they've got a lot more ridges and steepness than what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| but those regulations when you look at what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| would be very applicable to what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| a whole lot more than Asheville, which is a completely different market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| a completely different aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and certainly not the same as Fayetteville, Arkansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:59| I believe that's basically what I'd have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:07| but I would, except for one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I would encourage, just like Mike, I would encourage this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| and if you pull together 23 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| and if we were to break it down and look at who has the agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| you had six people, if you want to say, they had an agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| then the rest of the people had their own agenda back the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| if you really want to accomplish something with 23 people, it's very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| There were times during the meetings that I felt like I just would not say anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| because I knew that I was going to get comments back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| which at times I did, so I basically quit participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| You need a smaller committee of planners and professional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| that are familiar with regulations and know how to use them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| to sit down and come up with the regulations that would apply for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| and I would again encourage a look at Severe Cattage regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| both the counties and the major municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| because those things are workable and doable regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part2?start=2420)|
