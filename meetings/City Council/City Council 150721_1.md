| 2:25:07| And that's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| I'm just saying probably what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| I don't know that I've never done it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8710)|
| 2:25:17| So my point in this is that I just don't believe that somebody traveling that speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8717)|
| 2:25:25| is going to be able to comprehend a 35-foot sign coming down the interstate or going up the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8725)|
| 2:25:33| and I have a problem with that because when they pull off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| I mean, people, number one, aren't going to pull off if they're not comfortable with where they know they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| and people spend millions of dollars, the large corporations, but then we have, more importantly to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8744)|
| 2:25:52| we have the private investment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, I'm sure, on signage, and they got one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| When those people come off the interstate, they got one shot to get these customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| Now, I hope that they stay over and that we get them in our hotels and motels and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| but, you know, maybe a vast majority of them are wanting a new Arby's roast beef sandwich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| or they're wanting to fill up at Weigel's or Pilot or anything along that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| so you got one shot and you got signage to pull them in, and they have to be able to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| and you got to be sharp enough to have the best sign out there to get them to pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| So, you know, the last meeting, you know, we lowered them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| and I guess, I mean, I understand what Councilman Wallace is saying is subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| but to me, it's common sense to me that we didn't do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| and we didn't really know what we were doing, and keep in mind, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| what was brought forward to us was a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| It's not we're going to stay status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| We're going to reduce signage, and we're going to reduce it dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| So, you know, from what I've heard, and Councilman DellaVolpe alluded to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| I mean, just about everything that I've heard in the pictures, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| that were brought tonight are very nice signs, 20 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| I mean, they're great, but they're not interstate signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| and I don't hear many people saying things about our interstate signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| and I think we went overboard when we took it from 50 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| I think 40 is in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| I think it's meeting the spirit of what we're trying to do here is to beautify Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| but I think we went overboard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| So I'm going to make a substitute motion or an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| to have the maximum allowable sign height within 500 feet back to 40 and adjacent to 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8880)|
| 2:28:10| and I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Okay, there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| Okay, this is on changing the height to 40 and 35 on the first two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| Are you leaving the other two the same, or what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| I'm going with those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| I'm going with those two because it's my understanding that if I understand you right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| Councilman Grieve, I mean, these are things that were going to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| Is this what the other categories by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| That's a suggestion that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| So I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| That's fine, and that's why I understood it, and that's why I'm not going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| as I said, well, my motion is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| You know, I definitely understand your sentiment, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| I think it still goes to the heart of what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| and, you know, I don't want Knoxville to be known as an interstate exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| and that's what interstate exits are known for, are big, tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| When I explain Cumberland Avenue to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| I explain that Cumberland Avenue should not look like an interstate exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| and there, if you go by there, you can see a huge Wendy's sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| and then you'll see a new Crystal sign, a new McDonald's sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| I mean, restaurants you'd find at an interstate exit, but the signs look so much better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| and the Wendy's sign really stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| So that's the way, you know, I want, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| I think Knoxville should look into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| that people come off and would see an attractive town like I think they're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| on Cumberland Avenue at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| And the new Cumberland Avenue, I don't think it allows any pole signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| and I think it's got a maximum of six-foot-high monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| so I'll be voting against the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| Yeah, like I said, I've heard voices on all sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| I'm not concerned with the heights in those two categories that he's specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| My concern is greater in the all-other-road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| I thought we might have been a tad low there, but we'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| What I was going to say is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| we're lucky in that we're going to be getting, I guess somewhat belatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| logo signs in our city that will help these travelers going through Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| to know when there's food, lodging, you know, other attractions at this exit, gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| and they can get off and get the services they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| and at that point they're going to be on a local road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| where the traffic is going to be a little slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| and they're going to have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| They're going to have directional signs on the ramp saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| that way for Exxon, this way for, you know, Mobil or Weigel's or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| So we're going to have a different way to scratch the itch you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| at least as to those service industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| I think we should try this and then find out if somehow it's not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| but I think our job has to be to come up with a way to have a city that 20 years in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9083)|
| 2:31:31| when old signs are finally leaving and the world of dinosaurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| and we have an attractive place that people want to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| because they really enjoy the aesthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| So I don't think those changes should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| I think we should stay at 35 and 30 on those two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| I would argue later that we might want to up 10 feet to 15 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| based on some of these pictures that things are 14 feet and other heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| but I'll leave that for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| Okay. Do you want to speak to this height, 40, 35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| Well, I think you've got to keep in mind that, you know, to restate the obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| you have attached signs and detached signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| and attached signs is still 10% of the wall area of the primary building elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| no height restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| So if the two hotels that are built at Paper Mill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| that cost millions of dollars to build to attract customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| they did not use a detached sign, pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| They put it on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| They used that formula, 10% of the wall area, and they put it on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| It's probably four or five stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| It's probably greater than 50 feet from grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| and it's certainly in many cases it's above the interstate, and it's lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| So they used the ingenuity and the brand of their building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| the colors and the style of that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| and put it on the side of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| and got a much broader, bigger sign that is attractive without ever using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| and everything else they put is on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| I mean, it's small, it's low, it's even lower than 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| So, I mean, and the same in just about everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| I mean, you can do it on the building if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| So it's not that they're, again, you're not asking people to take down their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| The signs that are there, they're still going to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| They're not going to be able to take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| They're not going to have to change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| It's only, again, back to that change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| And so you can go from, you know, well, I'll let Christa decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9206)|
| 2:33:31| but I think that's much more the style today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| It's certainly much more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| It makes a better interchange, and people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| They want to be comfortable where they're getting off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| and there's certainly businesses add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| and you're seeing businesses use that sign a whole lot better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| advantageous to them, and a whole lot better price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| So I think you'd be hard-pressed to see the difference between 35 and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| There's nothing magical about 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| There's nothing magical about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| But I think you'd have a hard time driving by at 55 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9242)|
| 2:34:07| I think it's a speed limit through the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| I think you'd have a hard time guessing which one was 35 feet and which one was 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| Well, just to feed off of what Councilman Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9257)|
| 2:34:21| one of the things that the sign task force did look at was we looked at our intersections at the interstates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9261)|
| 2:34:28| and probably today 90% of all the sites are already taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| and so 90% of those areas are already covered with signs that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| The other thing that we really noticed, especially along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| and especially at interstate intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| was the fact that they're mostly food, hotel, this type of signage that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9285)|
| 2:34:51| And generally those people use a logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| McDonald's has the big M, and they use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| And so there's almost a difference between when we talk about signs adjacent to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9297)|
| 2:35:04| or at the interstate intersections as opposed to the signs of federally designated highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| and all other highways in terms of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| There is a distinction between the types of businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| The other thing that we notice is that really the billboards that we have do a lot of the advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| for those kinds of establishments that are along the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| And I think paper mill what George was picking out was the two new hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| or actually there are three hotels that are there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| and none of them have pole signs down at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9334)|
| 2:35:39| But you can see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| We're fortunate here in Knoxville in some ways because of the hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| and what we have in terms of where people can advertise right with their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| And so it is difficult to tell the difference between a 35 and a 40 from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| Okay, so we have an amendment that would put the top two roadway types to heights of 40 and then 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9356)|
| 2:36:06| Well, I've got one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| I mean, that's all well and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| I mean, the hotels and they're nice, and granted, I like how they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| But I haven't seen a Weigel's, an Arby's, a Pilot, a BP station that was five stories tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9375)|
| 2:36:22| You know, they're all regular size buildings that you can't see from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| It's very nice for a Hilton product to come up and you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| And it's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| I mean, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| Gold member, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| And when you pull in, they've got the monument signs and it looks wonderful, and that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| But we've got to be realistic again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| You say you can't tell the difference between 30 and 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Well, I think, or 35 and 40, I think you've got a lot better chance of them pulling off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9409)|
| 2:36:58| We're not an interstate city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| Nobody's saying something ridiculous like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| What I'm saying is let's get our share of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| Let's not let them go to Loudoun County and look back at Knox County because they don't know where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| There's not a member on this council that hasn't been very sold on selling the beauty of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9433)|
| 2:37:24| I'm not in any way suggesting we're an interstate stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| We're way more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| So, anyway, I get the arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| But, again, the hotels that are being built, I commend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| Glad they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| But that's a whole different ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| Okay, so I think we're ready to vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| This is on the amendment for the 40 and the 35 feet height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| So we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9492)|
| 2:38:13| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| Okay, the motion fails 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| Okay, is there anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| Then we move to the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| Now, on the sheet handed out, there's actually a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| It says 116C, sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| It's actually 116D, sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| Is that right, Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| Okay, and also on page 96, which shows this added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| it should be maximum sign areas for primary detached signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| rather than heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| Yeah, that was just a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| Yeah, typo's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| So, Krista, do you want to start with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| Sure, and this was discussed at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| and there were, I think, several motions made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| and I think the conclusion was that the law department would work on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| and come up with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| To be fair, the law department is a law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| not a planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| And so I worked with several council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| and these were the numbers that were suggested for council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9568)|
| 2:39:36| And that's 200, 200, 165, and 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9576)|
| 2:39:47| George, are these the ones that were sent to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| Yes, 200, 200, 165, and 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| If I could simply ask, what did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| We talked to a local sign company, I gather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| was what Krista had said earlier in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| Can you tell us where these numbers came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| so we have some sense of what level of confidence we have in them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| George, do you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| I think they came from a local sign company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| Signs they are using or installing, is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| I think that's a generous range of which you could build a 10-foot sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| It'd be a 10-by-10 sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| It can only be 10 feet tall, so 10-by-10 right on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9627)|
| 2:40:33| 10-by-10 would give you 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| So, I mean, that's a little bit generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| The reason I ask that is the consultant that Ms. Palmer consulted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9637)|
| 2:40:43| with Mr. Carpentier was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9643)|
| 2:40:47| well, that ought to be 300 feet for near the interstate or 330 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| That seemed on the big side, and I'm not concerned about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| but I'm just curious how we get the right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| And maybe, like you said earlier, this is somewhat subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| The argument is less is more in terms of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| I would argue that you'd be generous in the sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| and leave the flexibility to the business of how they want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9671)|
| 2:41:21| Again, you can restrict it all the way down as tight as you want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| These are maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Right, these are maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| A 20-foot sign, it still can only be 20 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| That's from the ground to the top of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| So, you know, you're not going to use the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| but you're going to have some pole or some monument to build it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| or, I mean, something else, which takes the sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| Those are generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| I think they give you a lot of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| Okay, so did we have a motion and a second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9721)|
| 2:42:07| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| Thank you, Councilwoman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| One of the things that we did look at at the sign task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| if we were going to reduce the area of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| we looked at how much we reduced the height of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| and we knew that the existing ordinance had a fairly generous sign face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| or area, which was at 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| So there is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| It's not necessarily scientific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| But if we reduce the sign heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| and the signs along the interstate, we reduce 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| The signs adjacent to the interstate, we reduce 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| The signs on federal highways, we reduce 60%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| and then all other signs we reduced 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Quite a reduction when you consider the heights that we reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| You could take those same figures and you could reduce the 220| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| where a sign face for an interstate sign would be 154 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| The sign face adjacent to an interstate would be 132.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| 20-foot signs would be 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| And to give some idea what that is, that's an 8x10 face on top of 20-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| And then the 10-foot signs would be 44, which could easily be an 8x4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| And, George, like you said, you have to take into consideration the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| One of the reasons that I took these pictures and gave to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| was to show that not only the height of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| but also what they've done with the faces of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| And it's kind of interesting to see how the people that buy signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9822)|
| 2:43:49| and put the signs up in front of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| there is a certain amount, I think, of self-regulation that they do themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| because of knowing that the sign can only be a certain height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| I mentioned to you folks before that the sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| looked at over 7,000, almost 7,000 sign permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| and of that 78% of those signs were less than 30 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| 72% were less than 24 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| Some of these signs that I took pictures of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| are representative of those particular signs, and you can see the sign face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| So, again, when we look at the maximum allowable sign area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| what we are, we are looking at the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| and we are looking at a certain size that people could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| It's a maximum size. It's not the size that they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| And I think that bears itself out in what we've seen in the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| I mean, we've had 50-foot signs in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| and 72% of all the signs built in the last 12 years, minus this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| were less than 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| So there is a certain amount of self-regulation on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| So I would even propose, if council is willing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| go ahead and do the reduction in the 220,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| the way we've done the reduction in the sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Are you using the 200, 200, 165?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| I'm using the 220 that's in the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| Yeah, but we're talking about right here in this chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| Are you talking about those numbers or some other numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| What we have in the sign ordinance, the sign face can be 220 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| So what I would look at, if you look at page 5 that Chris has given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| instead of 200 square feet, it's 154.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| Instead of 200 square feet, it's 132.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| Instead of 165, it's 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| Instead of 100, it's 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| You're saying more restrictive than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| So is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| I'll make that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| We have a number in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| So it's a motion to add those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| The ones in black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| This is, yeah, on the screen is how the ordinance reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| So you would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Well, the ordinance doesn't have anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| So this is a motion to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| Right now the ordinance is in blank for area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| So there is no motion on the floor to amend it either to the 200, 200, 165, 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9972)|
| 2:46:17| or to 154, 132, 88, 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| I made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9981)|
| 2:46:22| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| You made the second one to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Just now I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| Okay, just now I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| 134, 132, 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9987)|
| 2:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| So the motion, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| To the 154, 132, 88, and 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| There's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| So that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=9999)|
| 2:46:40| Well, I'll make a motion that we, the motion is as Krista has submitted before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10000)|
| 2:46:49| That 200, 200, 165, 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10013)|
| 2:46:54| I'll make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| Mr. Councilman Grieve, what were your numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| 154, 132, 88, and 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| I'll make a substitute motion for those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| We just voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| We didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| There was a lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| Would you second my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| We already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| We didn't vote, but you didn't get a second, so it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| That amendment has already failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| So you're going to have to come up with something different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| But I'm basically reconsidering, and I was on the prevailing side, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Well, then you can make a motion to reconsider, which takes five votes to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10049)|
| 2:47:37| Go ahead and knock yourself out, son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Just change the numbers a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Change the numbers a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| I'll make it for 155, 134, 90, and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10062)|
| 2:47:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10073)|
| 2:47:54| That's a legitimate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| 155, 134, 90, and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10084)|
| 2:48:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| Now, discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| Councilman Dellegate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| Oh, I guess I still had my light on, but I guess I'm concerned that we had numbers that maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10091)|
| 2:48:19| Councilman Starr is saying, are too generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| But I hate to just tighten the noose around the neck of these businesses that want to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| They are the lifeblood of our city in terms of jobs for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| opportunities for at least residents to shop and maybe out-of-towners to shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| and a source of property taxes that runs the engine of the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10117)|
| 2:48:42| And I don't want us to strangle them in the interest of, I don't know, being the smallest-signed city in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10122)|
| 2:48:52| I'm more comfortable with the larger numbers, and I won't support the substitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10132)|
| 2:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10141)|
| 2:49:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| I think this is where you've got to give the leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| You know, you argued the sign height down, and then I think you've got to give them leeway to work within those time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10147)|
| 2:49:17| It's still the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| It can't be greater than 10 feet high, but you can still have area up to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| you can put it all the way down to the ground and have a 10-foot sign, which is still pretty ample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| You can still build the shrubs under it that you guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| Build the shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| You've still got a landscape around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| I mean, I think that's, you know, it's a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| It's a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| I mean, range is from zero to that, but I think it gives you enough generous space to work around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| So, I mean, I support a little bit more generous and a little bit more leeway on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10181)|
| 2:49:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| Once again, I'm concerned that Knox County has some different standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| and if a business is choosing between coming to the city of Knoxville with minimal signage as opposed to going to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10196)|
| 2:50:05| I think that we stand a substantial risk of losing business that would be settling in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10205)|
| 2:50:12| and that means losing that revenue that we seem to count on to keep our city oiled and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10212)|
| 2:50:19| In Knox County, the maximum sign height is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| In commercial, industrial, and shopping centers, it's 40 feet other than a neighborhood shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10223)|
| 2:50:31| A mixed-use, an office area has a 20-foot sign, and then the planned zones are 8 feet to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| And so that addresses the height, and then the size of the sign itself is in proportion to the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| So I'm just really concerned that we are sitting here tonight driving business into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| and I know Mayor Burchett will be thrilled, but I'm not going to be thrilled when we have revenue issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10249)|
| 2:50:56| because we've lost substantial business to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10256)|
| 2:51:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10261)|
| 2:51:02| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| Yes, I didn't really get an opportunity to speak to the sign square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10263)|
| 2:51:10| Part of my numbers, and I was looking to go lower, were primarily based on other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10270)|
| 2:51:17| Oak Ridge, our neighbor, they have a maximum sign height of 20 feet and a sign area of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10277)|
| 2:51:25| Maryville, it's 20 feet and 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| Charlotte, which is a much bigger city, their numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| and really I think what I was going to propose was going to be reflective of theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| they have a height of 40 feet as 128, 30 feet of 100, 20 feet at 64, and 20 feet at 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10296)|
| 2:51:46| So theirs are much more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| So it certainly won't be the smallest sign square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| So that's where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| They're not coming from nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| They're coming from other places that have done this and still have business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| and are still growing and have healthy economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| I tend to agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| We've already demonstrated by these photos that Duane took that there is a lot of self-regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| So I would tend to err on the high side, maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10338)|
| 2:52:25| and rely on the self-regulation, which we've already demonstrated works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| So I would favor the proposal that the law department has come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10349)|
| 2:52:38| So we're going to vote on the substitute motion by Councilman Stair, 155, 134, 90, and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10358)|
| 2:52:46| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10366)|
| 2:52:50| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10370)|
| 2:52:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| Councilman De La Vulpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10379)|
| 2:53:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10382)|

| 2:53:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| Okay, that fails 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| Is there another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| Oh, well, we're back to the original amendment, which is the 200, 200, 165, and 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10402)|
| 2:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10408)|
| 2:53:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| Okay, that passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| And you corrected that typo with the area instead of height, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10426)|
| 2:53:47| In the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10427)|
| 2:53:48| It says area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Maximum sign areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10430)|
| 2:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10439)|
| 2:54:00| Okay, so anything else on Section 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10440)|
| 2:54:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| Section 12, which is sign construction and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| Section 13, abandoned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| Section 14, legal nonconforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| I have something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| I've been emailing back and forth with Krista to get this corrected, but we came up with some language at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| and it was kind of one big, dense paragraph that made my head spin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| So I think Krista may have an adjustment or two, but you were handed a sheet that broke it down into subsections A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10476)|
| 2:54:45| Krista, you might have one that you said had some changes, last-minute changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| Why don't you put that one up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| I'm not wedded to anything other than let's make it easier to read and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10491)|
| 2:54:59| So Councilman De La Volpe, as he just talked about, recommended breaking this down into subsections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| and I do agree that that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10505)|
| 2:55:08| It's a pretty large paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| And so this breaks the language down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| It does not change any of the substance of the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10515)|
| 2:55:21| It just needs to be a period right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| It defines what change is, which is everything that's already in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| as it was adopted by Council at the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10531)|
| 2:55:36| So we've got the principal use, changing an expansion that constitutes a change in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10536)|
| 2:55:44| and then the specification that what a change in use is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10544)|
| 2:55:49| And then we have the determination by the building official when the use is not designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10549)|
| 2:55:54| or enumerated in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| And then we just, in the last section, say that if your sign or your use is illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10556)|
| 2:56:03| you don't get the benefit of your non-conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| So this is everything that was already in what Council adopted at the last reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| It just has headings and is broken down into, I think, a more manageable format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| There was a motion to approve. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10583)|
| 2:56:30| Okay, so there's a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10594)|
| 2:56:35| Okay, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10595)|
| 2:56:42| Okay, anything else on Section 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| I wonder, if I could, Mayor, I wonder on 14.2 if after that caption we could put some kind of a parenthetical thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10605)|
| 2:56:53| that says that's sort of historic information because we're not, we have prohibited new off-premise signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| so these rules don't apply to anything that would be permitted tomorrow, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10621)|
| 2:57:08| but it does refer to how we got all the signs in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| What are you on, 14.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| 14.2 is what is listed on my copy dated July 7, second reading, July 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10633)|
| 2:57:19| Yeah, page 101, 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| Page 101, 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| I would just like a little parenthetical after the 1984 that says historical reference only or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10643)|
| 2:57:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| We're not approving new billboards because in the prohibited section, three or four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10650)|
| 2:57:37| it says that's one of the prohibited things is off-premise signs, new ones being put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10657)|
| 2:57:44| So it's a reference so we don't lose the information, but you can't apply for anything under a 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10664)|
| 2:57:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| It seems to me that's already addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| The word prior would indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10677)|
| 2:58:02| Well, that means prior, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10682)|
| 2:58:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10683)|
| 2:58:04| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10684)|
| 2:58:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10686)|
| 2:58:07| Quicker on the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| That's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| Section 15, administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| Any issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| Well, I want to put this in 16, but you can have it in 15 as 15.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| And I want to add a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| We don't have a 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| Add a sentence that says the building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| and that's the person we've designated as being in charge of all these rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| shall report back to city council no later than six months after the effective date of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| to report any problems encountered or discovered during the administration of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10718)|
| 2:58:46| And I just think that even though we can always ask them any time to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| I would think that we're asking them to compile information about both good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10730)|
| 2:58:57| and problems that we need to know about because this is going to be somewhat of a living, changing document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10737)|
| 2:59:03| And I think we want to hear back what they're running into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| But, again, we could ask at any meeting, but they won't be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| So tell them, hey, in the next six months, tell us what you're running into so that we might reconsider some parts of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10752)|
| 2:59:20| if it's needed to fix a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| That's my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| Do you need that codified, or can you make that as a separate motion after everything's wrapped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10764)|
| 2:59:32| presumably for the night, saying could we respectfully request that office to provide us a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10772)|
| 2:59:40| just like you mentioned, within six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| Well, I was just thinking, since we're making law, why don't we make some law instead of suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| But I don't care. It's the preference of this council what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| I just think that we need a second look of things that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| and I'm suggesting six months is an opportune time to get a report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| However we do it, I'll leave that to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| I have two things to say about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| one of which is it's really probably not a proper thing to put in your code section with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10805)|
| 3:00:12| Secondly, it actually interferes with the division of power within the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10812)|
| 3:00:20| and I hate to get too particular about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| but frankly the mayor is in charge of the chief building official and gives him his orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10822)|
| 3:00:29| And if you ask for that report, I feel very confident the mayor will get that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10829)|
| 3:00:35| but you don't really have the authority to tell the chief building official to give you a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| at some certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| Okay. So we're just a victim to when he wants to report to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| Well, you can change your form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| You can ask me nicely and we'll just get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| Let's go with the suggestion that the mayor report back in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| Oh, it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10862)|
| 3:01:05| We'll be glad to. We'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| Okay. So anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| Yes, mayor, I'd like to move to approve our ordinance with its amendments on emergency reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10873)|
| 3:01:20| Okay, so that's the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10880)|
| 3:01:21| The whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| That would be a motion to amend it to make it an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| That means essentially that you would be done with it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| It would not come back for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| This is second reading, but the amendments that you all have just made are substantive amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| that would require this to be kicked back to a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| which absent making it an emergency ordinance, then it will come back in two weeks for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10904)|
| 3:01:52| If you amend it to an emergency ordinance, it will not come back in two weeks for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10912)|
| 3:02:00| Although you have made substantive amendments, they are all amendments that have been considered at MPC in various forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10920)|
| 3:02:08| and so it doesn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| But because they are substantive amendments in what's before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| it does kick it back to first reading unless you amend it to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| And that's strictly up to you whether you want to amend it to emergency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| It will take six votes to amend it to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| And it will allow Cindy to check that off her to-do list before she leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10947)|
| 3:02:34| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| Yeah, so typically an ordinance takes place how many days after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| Seventeen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| Seventeen days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10963)|
| 3:02:44| Seventeen days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10964)|
| 3:02:45| So invariably there are people out there in the process of getting signs permitted under the old ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10965)|
| 3:02:54| and I would like to amend that this take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10974)|
| 3:03:00| and give a little bit of grace period to those that are maybe in process or maybe up there ready for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10980)|
| 3:03:09| You can amend the ordinance to say that it will take effect 17 days from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=10989)|
| 3:03:21| or have an initial operative date of whatever 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11001)|
| 3:03:25| What's today, 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| 21-17 goes past August, and I can't do that math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11007)|
| 3:03:32| But whatever 17 days is, it will be August something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| You could say the initial operative date would be August something or other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| and then you could pass that on emergency ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| So like August 15th or whatever, whatever date he picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| Whatever date you pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| So I would amend it to be September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| I would amend it to make it September 1st, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| Can we get Peter to come up and address that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| Because this is going to affect us in how we permit our signs and do enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11041)|
| 3:04:06| so I'd just like to hear his opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11048)|
| 3:04:09| Peter Ahrens, Plains Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| Any application that has been submitted will be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| They won't be subject to the new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| Application date is the key date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| When somebody makes an application, it will be reviewed under the ordinance which it's under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11061)|
| 3:04:30| So if the ordinance changes after they've made an application, they're still grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| So I'm not sure you need to add additional confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| So if I give you an application next week, I'm still under the old ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| No, if it's already in the hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| Not if you pass it today on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| No, if it's on emergency tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| It's my understanding that it would be under the old ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| because the new ordinance doesn't come into effect for 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11097)|
| 3:05:01| But not if they pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| If they pass it on emergency tonight, it will take effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| So that means that if it comes in tomorrow, it would be under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| They're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| But the stuff that came in today is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| The stuff that came in today is under the old ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11117)|
| 3:05:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| So, Peter, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| Are you guys going to be prepared in your office to permit under these new guidelines here tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11120)|
| 3:05:28| Or do you feel like you need some time to get educated completely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| I think that our staff has been working with CRISTA pretty closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| I think we've got a pretty good handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| We've got a good handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| It will be a matter of educating the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| But they're aware that changes are imminent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| I don't understand exactly the difference between passing it on emergency tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| which is the same as the second reading, and letting it go to a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| And then after the second reading, you would have 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| So why would it become –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11163)|
| 3:06:06| I just need to be clear on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| Because the charter says when you pass an ordinance on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| it becomes effective immediately upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| It can become effective immediately upon passage with a future operative date in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| In other words, you could say August 1 or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| You could pick it out 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| I mean, you can choose to make it operative tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| or you can choose to make it operative 15 days or 17 days or 43 days from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11188)|
| 3:06:35| You can choose the date you want it to initially become operative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| by amending the ordinance to say that and still pass the ordinance on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11198)|
| 3:06:43| and it won't become operative until whatever that date is you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| But you'll have to amend it to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| If you don't amend it to have an initial operative date at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| then it will be operative tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| Actually, tonight, but nobody's taking a vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| I would contend that there's businesses out there that are building buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| and that are improving spaces that have no clue that we're up here hour after hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11226)|
| 3:07:12| working on a signed ordinance in an effort to be fair to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| That's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| I mean, I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| There's no second, but I think you're trying to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11243)|
| 3:07:24| Fair to the people that are caught in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| What is the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| The motion is to make effect of September 1, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11248)|
| 3:07:32| So it's an emergency taking effect September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| Right. That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| So they can learn a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| I mean, you've got people that are not following this like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| That would give us time to educate the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| and to put some kind of information together in building permits and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| so that when people know when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| they know that there are some changes in the signed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| because we will need some time to educate the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| We'll probably want to work with the communications with Jesse and Eric on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11279)|
| 3:08:12| Okay, so the first vote is the substitute to make this operative September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11292)|
| 3:08:19| and then we go back to the emergency amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11299)|
| 3:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11303)|
| 3:08:24| Councilman Delevaux, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| I'm wondering procedurally and fairness-wise whether I hesitate to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11307)|
| 3:08:34| but we should give Mr. King five minutes to say whatever he was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| now that he knows what he's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| He was standing in the back there waiting to comment on our statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11321)|
| 3:08:47| and I guess if we pass it, we kind of then have to reconsider or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| If he has something to add that won't derail us, we would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11331)|
| 3:08:59| Thank you, Councilman, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| I think the signed ordinance, even with its amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11343)|
| 3:09:12| doesn't really respond to many of the concerns and issues that I raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11352)|
| 3:09:20| when I sent the memo to members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| I'm still not going to speak to those matters any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11364)|
| 3:09:30| relying on the expressed intent of this body to keep reviewing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11370)|
| 3:09:36| and deal with problems because I know of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| I hope I have the chance to meet with those who are interested in trying to cure those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| and make those observations then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| But I do appreciate you calling on me, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11391)|
| 3:09:52| How about, Mayor, if I could ask Ms. Malone if she has a short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11392)|
| 3:09:57| It will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11397)|
| 3:09:58| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| I really have serious concerns about having the ordinance take place in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11403)|
| 3:10:12| What you're going to have is a rush for permits, which are good for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11412)|
| 3:10:20| 640, Interstate 640 was a billboard-free highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11420)|
| 3:10:26| People don't know that because there are billboards on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| and the reason there are billboards on it is because while the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| was working on making it a billboard-free highway before it was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| permits were issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| So you got the law passed too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| Emerald Isle in North Carolina was Emerald Isle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| until the State of North Carolina considered, during their year of the coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11444)|
| 3:10:52| how to protect the trees on Emerald Isle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| During that consideration, every tree was cut down by the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| It was no longer Emerald Isle, so they got protection, but it was after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| If you wait until September 1, everybody who might want a permit sometime in their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| will be applying for permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| If the Chamber of Commerce has not gotten word out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| and the new Sentinel, with its ridiculous editorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| have not gotten the word out to the business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| well, then they're not going to be in business very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| Signs is not their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| Their problem is much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11488)|
| 3:11:30| So I would ask you, and I think the way the ordinance was written when I looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| it was to take effect immediately, not even the 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| Mr. Swanson is nodding in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| I would ask that it be passed, and we live with 13-7-2-0-8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11500)|
| 3:11:45| the state law that keeps signs up for many, many lifetimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11505)|
| 3:11:51| It's about time we have some balance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| Let's pass a good ordinance and pass it tonight, taking effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| Okay, Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11525)|
| 3:12:06| I think I just would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| I mean, I think the whole purpose of this sign ordinance was that we believe that these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11528)|
| 3:12:13| that don't conform to this, that that's not what we wanted, and we were looking to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11533)|
| 3:12:19| So why would we want to allow an extended period of time for more of those type of signs to come into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11539)|
| 3:12:27| They're going to be grandfathered in forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| So I'll be voting against the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11552)|
| 3:12:33| Mr. Swanson, did I understand you to say that if we pass this without an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11553)|
| 3:12:39| the substantive amendments would come back or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11559)|
| 3:12:46| If you pass it without it being, without amending it to be an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11566)|
| 3:12:51| you will have passed it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| It will come back in two weeks in the form that you've amended it in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| Just wanted to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11578)|

| 3:15:15| I also want to tell my colleagues and also the audience that we still have more work to do, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11715)|
| 3:15:22| I'll make that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| I also want to thank the assigned task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| Some of the members, I think, are still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| It's been a long process to get where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| and I think council understands with what we've been through the last number of hours in terms of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11733)|
| 3:15:39| There's a couple things that I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| One thing, I've already mentioned this to Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| I've talked to Peter about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| But I'd like to challenge Scenic Knoxville to help in identifying the abandoned signs and the signs that need maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11746)|
| 3:15:54| And this could very easily be done by several people going up and down our major arteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| photographing and giving the addresses and getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| So that's a challenge I want to make to Scenic Knoxville that you keep up the work and help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11762)|
| 3:16:11| But, again, I do want to thank everyone that's participated in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11771)|
| 3:16:16| It's been a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| But, again, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| And, Cindy, as I said to you last time, you were a great help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| and I can't thank you enough for all that you've done to help through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| You've been a storehouse of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| It's been interesting how I can say to Cindy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| Cindy, what happened with billboards back 20 years ago for a signed task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| So, Cindy, thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| Appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| Let's thank Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11798)|
| 3:16:39| We've added something new to her portfolio here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11799)|
| 3:16:44| Okay, so now nobody has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| So unless there is an objection, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=11807)|
