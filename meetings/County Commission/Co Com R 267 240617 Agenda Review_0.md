| 0:00:34| in session of the Knox County Commission on Monday, June 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| I want to thank everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| This is the first day of our new meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| So this is just an agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| The structure is a little bit looser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| We do not have to call roll or take minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| So what I'm going to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| we have a couple of items that have been pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| by specific commissioners for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| I'm going to read those off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| and then if you would like to add anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| just please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| From consent, Commissioner Oster, number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=71)|

| 0:01:16| Schoonmaker, items 29 and item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| And Frazier, items 22 and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| Does anyone have anything else they would like pulled for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Commissioner Frazier, I would like to pull 26 just for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| so we can have those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| We'll pull number 26 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| 34 for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| And then next week I've got Solid Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| and Lieutenant Walker coming in and giving a little presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| on how the ordinance is working and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| I've got one more, and I'll find it here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| We're going to add agenda item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| We'll add two presentations on the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| Just for the viewing public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| today also will be our first zoning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| beginning at 5 p.m. here in the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| And then also just a note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| the public ordinance meeting has been rescheduled to June 15th at 4.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| So if you would kindly make those notes in your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| I'm sorry, July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Correction there, July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| I want to quickly just apologize for Madam Chair and Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| They have been detained just a little bit, but they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| So they asked me to kind of step in on the fly so it isn't this fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| So we're going to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Madam Chair, 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Commissioner Daley's adding number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| So the first item that has been pulled looks to be number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| That is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| So this is the consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| approving the schematic design of the new Farragut Area Elementary School by McCarty-Holsap, McCarty, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| I pulled this because I've been having conversations with the citizens who own property adjacent to the proposed school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| I've also been talking with Mr. Adams in Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| and we're trying to address several of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| And those concerns include preserving the character and the heritage of the immediate area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| following the design standards of the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| consider traffic calming measures on Boring Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| consider a traffic stacking pattern that keeps vehicles off of public roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| consider a designated school bus stacking pattern that keeps buses off of public roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| installation of a traffic light at Boring Road and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Currently, there are no road improvements in the Town of Farragut five-year capital plan on Boring Road from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| The property is in need of mowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Consider a planted buffer of 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| and also they were going to inquire with Ingalls to see if it would be agreeable to route a traffic pattern on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| So those are the things that I've asked Mr. Garfield to come before us and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| and let us know how those are going to be mitigated and what the discussions have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So that's really why I pulled that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Anyone have any discussion? Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| Thank you, sir. It didn't quite kick in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| On the 100 foot buffer, is that going to be just strictly on the east side or the west side of Boring Road then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| It's not going to be on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Right. Adjacent to property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Okay. And then what is the, when you say X, how did you classify through the Ingalls property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| And that was a question that the Town of Farragut was going to reach out and inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| We think the likelihood of that is very slim, very slim, but they did want the question asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| And so we want to be able to let our constituents know that the question was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you. Commissioner Durer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| My question has left. Oh, will Mr. Garfield be here next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| He will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Yes, he's going to be prepared to present and talk about some of these concerns and considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| If there's no further discussion, we will move on to agenda item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| Let's see. And that is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:23| That wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Oh, sorry. Commissioner Durer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| I just pulled this because I would like Mr. Caldwell, if he's here, to give us the names of the reappointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| And then I know there's there's one space for appointment and who our candidates are for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:49| I'll fill in for Mac McWhorter. I'll give you what I know, if that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Lease. I mean, Tiffany Garner is a reappointment and Bill Fox is a reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:07:05| And there are these. There are two individuals for the open seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:16| One is a partner at Cope Architects. I cannot recall her name at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| Drew, do you have that? Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| That's it. So Casey Petco. And then the other nominee is Janet Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| I think that and Janet is in the audience, if you may have any questions for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| So two reappointments and then two for for one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| And I know that Mac McWhorter will be here on Monday to answer any questions and talk about the appointment terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:55| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell. Miss Testerman, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:11| Hello, everyone. Janet Testerman, 6511 South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Yes, I've submitted my name for consideration for the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| I have spoken to Mr. Odom about this appointment and about his vision for the board and ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| And obviously my desire to continue to be involved in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| And I think the expansion of businesses, the recruitment of businesses to this community is vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| And I'm really certainly interested in helping fulfill that vision and move the board's initiatives along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| So happy to answer any other questions, but appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Commissioners, have any other questions? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| Then we will move on to agenda item number 29. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. I ask the engineering department to give us a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| On the costs associated with our paving budget, particularly how those costs have changed in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| And then also in the new fiscal year, based on the new rates, how many miles in Knox County do they anticipate they'll be able to pave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:51| Good afternoon, everybody. So we've got two hot mix hauling and placement contracts this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| One is for our regular paving of regular width roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| And the narrow roads paving contract is for those roads that are about 15 foot and narrower and that have an in-out pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:17| So they're a dead end. You can't pull a truck all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| So the purpose of splitting them out in this way was to ensure that any increased costs that we might incur for the narrow roads were isolated to just those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:36| So we weren't bringing in any inflationary prices into the entire contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| So looking back at the rates that we've got on each of the items that are in our contract over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| between fiscal year 23 and fiscal year 25, line items have on average increased by 9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:11:02| So if we look at certain line items, you'll see that typically they're in, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| So we've got certain items are much higher than others in terms of the increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| But a lot of those are really low cost increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| So, for example, on one of the line items, the unit price is $2 per linear foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| And it's gone up to $4 per linear foot over the course of those fiscal years, which looks like a very large increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| But, in fact, it's actually quite small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| The difference in the paving costs that we've got on this bid between our regular contract and our narrow road contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| the narrow road contract items are about 10% higher than our regular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| Looking at the costs to pave a mile of road on the different kinds of roads that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| we're looking at paving a subdivision road, which is typically around 26 foot wide, and we typically pave with emix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:13| In 2023, the cost we would have had for that for a mile of road would be $170,532.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:23| Now, in FY25, we've got a cost of $185,289.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| So that represents, I think it's about a 6% increase on those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| This doesn't account for any kind of work that we might need to do prior to prepare the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| So there's no cost for undercutting, wedge milling, leveling, anything like that, or any of the culvert replacements that might be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| This is simply for laying of asphalt on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| For a county collector road, so we cannot use the cheaper mix asphalt on those because there's too high traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=774)|
| 0:13:05| For a county collector road that on average is 22 foot wide, we would be looking at a difference in cost from FY23 of $159,384 per mile to $169,303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:23| So typically, we can pave, we do pave around 38 to 40 miles a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| I didn't actually do the math on how many fewer miles we would be able to pave, but we're also very fortunate that Chris Caldwell gives us increases in paving budgets every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:42| So we typically sit around that 40 miles, regardless of the cost increases for the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| Madam Chair, can I also address number 30 at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Sure, I was just about to ask if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Thank you. On the 15 miles, excuse me, 15 feet or less, of the 2,000 miles that we have of county roads in Knox County, how many are 15 feet or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:12| Let me find that answer because I did ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| Okay, so we have, sorry, let me find this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:26| 533.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| So there are 182.7 miles, which represent 533 individual roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:44| That sounds better. I was a little concerned when 25% of our roads are less than 15 feet, so okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:53| And with those, it's kind of interesting, we've got, with those, we've got the majority of the county roads are 15 feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:15:04| And it's an average length of about 1,400 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| There are only 11 streets that are narrower than 10 foot, but narrower than 10 foot is pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| Okay, that's kind of similar to the private drive that goes up to Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| So with, if I'm doing the math right, 50, excuse me, 2,000 miles of county roads are 15 feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:31| So that's pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| Less than 10 feet on Government Farm Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Pretty thin, yeah, there's no two-way traffic on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So with, if I'm doing the math right, 50, excuse me, 2,000 miles of county roads, is that still an accurate number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:53| It is, it depends on whether, yes, I think that's pretty accurate, it's around 1,900 and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| And so we're, we can do 40 miles per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| So we've got, we can repave every road every 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Well, I just wanted the information for this body and then for the folks listening at home, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| Absolutely, and we've done a lot of looking at kind of projecting what we can do with our pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| with the new pavement management system, it's been really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| And there are some different techniques that we can use in order to elongate the lifetime of our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| Oftentimes those techniques aren't as palatable to the citizenry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| so some of those kind of techniques could be putting on chip seals on some rural roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| but I know a lot of people aren't really excited about having loose stones on the roads, even if they're in rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| So we're trying to work through the best techniques that we can employ to be able to elongate the lifecycle of our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| One of the things that we're looking at doing this year is putting on a product called Reclamite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| and it's something that goes on about three years after a road has been freshly paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| You may start to hear about that in your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Once a road has been paved, we come back three years after and put on a very low-cost treatment that puts the oils back in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| and it actually prevents those roads from oxidizing quite as quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| So we're starting to bring some of these new techniques into our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Great. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Don't leave yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| The narrow roads, that does not include your in-house paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So our in-house paving, what we typically try and do is we identify short sections of road that will either be well-addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:18:02| So say, for example, you've got a short section of road that has some kind of situation-specific reason why it's deteriorating quicker than the rest of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:14| In those cases, we'll get our in-house paving crew to go out there, do the undercutting that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| do some improvements, and then relay the same level of asphalt back in there, and that'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| Once you start getting into longer segments of road, it's much harder to justify using our in-house crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| It's cheaper and just more efficient to use a different crew to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| With those narrow roads, we've been unable to get to those roads for the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| It's been something that's been sitting there on a list that we just haven't had the resource to be able to actually go out there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| This is a way for us to jump ahead, get ahead of that backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Once you pave some of these really narrow roads with very low traffic volume, it's unlikely they're going to deteriorate the same rate of decay as your collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:11| So we're hoping that by doing this, we're going to push those out for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| You've done quite a few in my area, and you can't tell the difference unless you see the truck as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| They do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Is the cost per mile or whatever the same as this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| It would be hard for me to give you a number right off the bat, but we do have our own contract with similar agencies like APAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:44| We have a contract with them as well as PRI and some of the other vendors that will give us hot mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| We go and pick it up and put it in the paving truck and then go and lay it down ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| It's a lot cheaper if you're just looking at that item, but what it doesn't include is kind of the time away from other projects and then the cost of your equipment and your labor and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:20:09| This is just a way to kind of supplement the low staffing that everybody has at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| That is there to do the narrow roads, to do the short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Lindbergh was like maybe three-eighths of a mile, and you guys did that, and you couldn't tell any difference if it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I got one question to ask you, and I don't understand, and you probably don't know this, but why does, I'm going to say TDOT, they put about that much asphalt and about that much asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:48| and then they put that much asphalt on Alcoa Highway, and that top layer is already coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Why did they do a two-inch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| We don't do a two-inch, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I mean, if you're talking about the way a road is actually constructed, you've got your sub-base and your base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| They put a two-inch layer on top, and the first winter comes along, the water seeps through, and it's a pothole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| And I just don't, it's interesting why they just do a, there's got to be a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| I don't know, but it looks like a thicker layer than two inches would have been better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| A deeper pothole, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Kathy, do you know how many miles of road do we accept each year on average, new road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| That will be a phone a friend kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| I've got someone who tallies that up, but I don't have it in my brain right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| I'd love it if you would tell us that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And Commissioner Schoonmaker, I appreciate your question, but I think it's twice as bad as you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| Last time I went through this exercise with EPW, which was about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| they had talked about the basic maintenance of roads in that the longer we wait to take care of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| the more those roads deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| The cost of repaving a normal road is whatever, and then if you wait until it deteriorates to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| it's another third as much, and if you wait to a certain point, it's twice as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| I mean, it gets worse and worse, and the price goes up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| And the basic maintenance should be about 10% every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| So we should be, just to do basic maintenance, not even new roads, we should be doing about 10% every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| And for as long as I went back through the records, 60 was the most we ever did in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| even with some additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| I think it was 60 or 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So if you hear 40, that's 160 miles this year that didn't get touched that should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| Last year, another 160, and you can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| We have almost as many miles of road that have been ignored as we do actual miles of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| when it comes down to the maintenance, because obviously some are higher traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| and they need to be done more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Some can be done once every 25 or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| But the reality is that there's several neighborhoods that I've talked to this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| that were built somewhere between 25 and 35 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| and their roads have never, ever been touched in 25 to 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| So the delta of what we have to tackle is so far greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| and it's probably more like a 90- or 100-year road plan at this point, even if we could catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Just adding some more context, but I appreciate you bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| It's something we've talked about for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| and the price continues to go up and the amount of miles that we pay continue to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and it's not a good formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Are there any other questions for Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Kathy, one other thing, and I was actually going to wait until next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| but since we're talking about roads, on number six on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I've not seen this before where we're going to accept Dubusque Lane as a new county road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| but it looks like when we accept it we're going to spend $53,000 to pave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Or is that just the number of once we accept that road, 50 years from now it will be $53,000 to repave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| I believe that's just a figure that is typically presented when we accept new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| We do a bit of calculation so that you're all aware of what that maintenance burden will be going forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| but because this does not have that traditional paperwork with it, I think they just added that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| But it was a private road previously, and then now we're going to accept it as a county road then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| But it doesn't have to be 100% condition when we accept it, potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I believe we have to make sure that it's built to county standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| but I don't believe it has to be freshly paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Kathy, you gave us some really great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Would you care to email the data that you just provided to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| I think it would be a great reference material for every commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| I know Jim and I have talked about this a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| but we'd be absolutely happy to give you guys a presentation on paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and what we've learned through this pavement management process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| If you're interested in learning more, obviously it can get kind of boring really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| so I don't want to bore everybody to pieces, but that's always an option if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I'm going to move on to agenda item number 33, and I had pulled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| This is the mobility study for the Choteau area in southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| I wanted to ask for a timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and then also if we could consider conducting this study during school session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| when school is in session, and also possibly spring sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| but I don't want to delay the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| We often hear from our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| it's great that you did a mobility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| but you didn't hit the peak hours or the peak times of year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| and the thing that I hear the most is when school is in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Yeah, we have a traffic engineering group in engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| and one of the guys that participates on that is a contractor called Alan Childers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| and he constantly talks about the weirdness of Hardin Valley traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| and he said it operates unlike a lot of other areas that he studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| We typically try and get our traffic counts during school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| because this is a common problem everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| For example, we're doing traffic calming counts for our traffic calming program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| and we stopped the vendor from taking those counts during the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| because we think they're just not going to be representative of the worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| We'll definitely do that in both the East Knox and the Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| or the Choteau areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| In terms of a timeline in Choteau, what we have is part of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| so for the East Knox project, part of what they're going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| is putting together a data model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| and it's very similar to our strategic transportation plan that we did many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| basically is just a data model, a table that looks at all of our roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and then collects attributes about it, like AADT, width, number of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| and what we can do is start to look at where the crashes are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| look at the attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and then predict where crashes might happen elsewhere based on similar attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| maybe once if existing volumes are really low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| but as volumes rise, you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| oh, this has got the same attributes as this road over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| We can anticipate that there are going to be an increase in crashes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| So we are doing work with CDM to do the data model in East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| and then Canon and Canon is actually going to use that data model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| so we're consistent in Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| So there is a little bit of a time delay because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| but we're looking at trying to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| ASAP, they're going to be waiting on that data model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| and they'll plug that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I think Jim was looking at kind of winter having something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| but if there is a need to take into account the spring sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| I know along kind of the Cove area it's really impactful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| we can certainly take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you, Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Any other questions, Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I mean, Choteau is a very unique area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| What are they exactly studying, what are they trying to look for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Because there's only two ways in and two ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| It's busy, I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I don't know what $90,000 is going to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I'm just trying to get a grasp of what we're spending money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| So this is going to be looking at existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| trying to quantify existing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| So first of all, doing a study and saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| the existing number of folks living in the Choteau Peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| where are the choke points and what needs to be done in order to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| those to get them up to a certain standard that we would accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| whether it's safety standards or whether it's capacity standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| and delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| We're also going to be looking at growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| So what kind of growth could we expect to happen in Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and what kind of impact would that have on the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| And then what are some mitigating measures you could take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| So those are the kind of things that we're going to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| So it's not just what's wrong now and what's the cost of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| going to do to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| It's what's wrong now, what would it look like in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| and what would it cost to fix those different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| or problems that might arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| This one just seems, out of all the places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| just seems very obvious to me, especially with the only thing you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| is make North Shore wider, basically, or redo the underpass at the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| There's literally your choke points and the only way in and the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| out of the whole entire space going into Knox County that we can control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| is going into Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| It doesn't really matter because we can't control that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| So is it going to grow more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Yeah, I mean, all the land's almost built out, but it'll grow some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| There'll be more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I hate seeing $90,000 go for a very common sense kind of prediction here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| like, all right, here's 90 grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| You're going to tell us exactly what I just told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| It's just kind of a, I don't know if it's the greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| You can pay me half and I can put it in writing and be more efficient that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| save us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I guess it's not just looking at capacity issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| so not just looking at the choke points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| but it's also looking at areas where increasing traffic might lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| to more accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| So if you're looking all the way down Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| you're looking at some of the roads down on the peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| We're also potentially looking at the impact on the town of Farragut's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| infrastructure because I know that's something that we wanted to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| to be good partners with the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Again, it's just there's only two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| Commissioners, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| That's why we're not traffic engineers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Looking at agenda item number 34, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Item 34 is the letter grant, and I have solid ways probably Drew Thurman will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| and do a rundown of what the letter grant program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| Some of it goes to KAKB for actually for teaching about letter kits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:51| stuff like that that's got to be part of this grant, so they're going to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Also, and I'll probably try to invite Lizzie also to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and give a little update on KKB at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| And then Lieutenant Walker will come and give us some news about tire dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| and illegal dumpings and how many signs companies that he's contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| how many arrest warrants he's put out, which you'll be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| And also, if you see, you know, some people do, some people don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:33| I think Commissioner Schoonmaker appreciates you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| He sees a sign in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| He takes a picture of it, sends it in, pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| It's illegal, except for political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Do not pick up political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| You don't want the picture in the paper picking up a political sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And garage sale signs are legal for three days is all they're legal for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| So look forward for this next week, and you'll get some good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| I'll have Drew send it out next end of the week or sometime once I get it from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| So looking forward to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner Daley, you did want to add that as a presentation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| It's just an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I think it just needs to be at the agenda item, let them come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and just like Kathy just did and answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Moving on to agenda item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| Commissioner Daley, I believe this is yours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It is. It's from Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Not to steal any Parks and Rec's thunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| and the AEMBC, they've done a great job of purchasing some land behind Anderson School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| the old Anderson School over on Prospect Road off Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| and I just want Joe Mack and maybe one of the AEMBC guys to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| It adds a little bit more behind the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and it extends the urban wilderness, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And they'll be here next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Is there anything else on the agenda that anyone would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| I wanted to quickly just go back to our presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| I had asked Kelly Archer to come and speak to us for Junior Achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| One thing that this commission did in our last budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| was we funded the opportunity for every fifth grader in Knox County to attend BizTown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| if they were able to, and I really advocated for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| because we do not have a program in Knox County schools currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| that aligns elementary-age students with the 865 Academy's mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| and goal of introducing career opportunities and exploration to our students at earlier ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| And so what this does is it enables those fifth-grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| and those schools that want to participate the ability to attend BizTown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| where they get to elect a mayor, they learn how to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| they have to manage a budget, they have to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| they have to open a bank account, a savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| If you have not been to BizTown, I really encourage you to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| It's such a great program and that's just something that I'm really proud of that we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| So she'll be here to talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Commissioner Dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| I second that because my daughter got to participate this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| and she was the election commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| And so she got to go around and get everyone's vote for different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| She got to create the ballot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| She got to choose from a select number of ballot initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| and so it was really cool to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| They had a mayor, they have City Hall, they have businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| they have a food court, they have all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| And so I definitely recommend going, even if it's just for a visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| going and checking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| It's really awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you, Commissioner Dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| And with that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Can I make one other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Oh, yes, Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-agenda-review?start=2249)|
