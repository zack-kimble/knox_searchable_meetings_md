| 0:07:20| As we move through this morning, I am sure that many of you are wondering how I'm lucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| at just 18 years old to be standing here as your emcee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| Well, to be honest, I was surprised when Mayor Kincaid reached out to me and maybe a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| But I represent the next generation of leaders, and I don't need to wait until I graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| high school to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| I come from a long line of political leaders back in Honduras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| My uncle is mayor of San Jeronimo, and my grandfather was a congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| I hope one day to follow in their footsteps, but here in my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=478)|
| 0:08:09| My parents moved here more than 20 years ago, and this is where I was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| This is the community where I want to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| But honestly, there's not a lot of Hispanic representation in local politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| But it's safe to say if things go as planned, I hope to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=500)|
| 0:08:31| That's actually a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| But at the age of 15, I started working with local campaigns and most recently volunteered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| with Mayor Kincaid's reelection team, and she won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I guess you can say I am starting off strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Now, without any further ado, it is time for the presentation of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=527)|

| 0:27:59| funding for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1679)|

| 0:28:32| And while we all love these big milestone projects, I know from the many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| I had on people's front doors that it's the less visible stuff that people rely on for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1717)|

| 0:28:54| And we will find a long-term solution to our aging stormwater infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| It's the boring stuff that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| So as I was knocking doors this summer in East Knoxville, a woman came up to me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1746)|

| 0:29:16| And so for those of you who have knocked on doors, you know that this is often the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| of a long conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| So she asked me, Ms. Mayor, what is your position on gentrification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Ooh, tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Well, let me clarify that there's a difference between gentrification and revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| I'm all for revitalization, but we need to avoid displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| She nodded and told me that a few years back, the house next to her had sold for $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1778)|

| 0:29:55| She was so happy to see this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| So as our city continues to grow, we must welcome revitalization while also working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| to make sure everyone has an opportunity to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=1803)|

| 0:42:47| That was probably one of my hardest votes on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| I think Vice Mayor Roberto has done an excellent job as Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Mayor McKenzie before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I think that our class, if you will say, of council has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| able to do a great job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So I'd like to make a motion to approve Tommy Smith as the vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| of council electees or electeds has a great depth of talent and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| just totally I'd like the idea of sharing the duties and the roles amongst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| council members and I appreciate all the hard work that Vice Mayor Roberto has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| put into our staff because I think a lot of people in the public don't and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2597)|

| 0:44:11| Mayor. I guess maybe the determining thing for me was kind of the sharing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| the the duties and giving council people who were qualified an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-inauguration-4340-231216?start=2658)|
