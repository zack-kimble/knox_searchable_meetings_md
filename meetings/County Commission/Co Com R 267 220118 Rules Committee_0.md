| 0:00:31| I'm calling to order the Rules Committee for January the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| And there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Madam Secretary, call the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Mr. Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| He's here, but we'll recognize Mr. Jay's here by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| He can participate, but he cannot vote if we do a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Unless the executive order expired correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| And understand that, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| Good go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Do we have any amendments in addition to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| I'm wondering if we need to make an amendment to change that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| That rule just has expired by executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Well, that's what they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| That bill that they were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| There was a bill that was introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Yeah, I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| But our county, when we went in February to that meeting, the county commissioners there from these little counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| they thought it was a terrible idea because they feared that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| that would give everybody an excuse to go on vacation and join the meeting at a vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| Well, that wasn't the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Clearly, I had not read, because I do not recognize that this precluded a member from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Well, hopefully that'll get worked out, and then it'll happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Are there any amendments or additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| Seeing none, motion to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Motion by Commissioner Buster, seconded by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Approval of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| I need everybody to get a copy of the minutes in their e-mail correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Any additions or corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| If not, motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| This one shouldn't take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| I don't even think we'll have to even vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| We'll get the law director's opinion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Jill's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Jill's opinion, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| All of our committees, this was brought forth by me, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| All of our committees are appointed on September, the first month in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| And except for the two, the Ag Committee and the Arena Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| And I suggest for clarity purposes that we move that to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| The ending date would be August the 24th on whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| So that will be appointed the same day that we appoint all committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Well, the Agricultural Extension Committee, there's a state statute that says you have to do it at your first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| if you're calling in your first meeting in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Well, that's why you're here, and that's why I told you to see what the brains are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| I'm the first to admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| So forget about the Ag one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| The reason Arena Use is the way is when it was set up as a memorandum of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| the very first terms began in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| So it's just always followed that cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| We changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| I mean, that's just in the agreement when the first terms began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| But it's a memorandum of agreement with us and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| And UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| And UT, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Well, it looks like we're going to leave them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| So that was a good, good information for us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| I thought it would just be clarity-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I should have asked Jill to do it beforehand, shouldn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Since nothing can be acted on that, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Item number, excuse me, number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| This is Mr. Spoonbaker's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I'm going to turn the floor over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you, Chairman Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| When we recently had our appointment for a judicial position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| it occurred to me that we need to possibly look at updating our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| when it goes to elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Of course, I'm not talking about any kind of committee appointment or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| And the reason is I think that on something where you're appointing a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| or perhaps a county commissioner like we did with Richie Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| that there should be a time limit prior to the special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| with when a resume can be sent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| So what I was looking at is maybe what we need to consider is seven days prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| seven calendar days prior to the special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| This would then afford U.S. commissioners the opportunity to interview the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| and have a cup of coffee, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Under our current rules, somebody could actually show up at the special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| and could get on the list of those to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| And I think it's something as serious as a judge or a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| that it shouldn't be a last-minute effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| The other thing in our rules, at that same meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| a county commissioner could make an appointment for that judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And again, I think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I think that, again, it doesn't afford the other ten commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| the opportunity to interview that candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| And we would never then stop or delay that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| because it's a special call meeting to appoint that judge or commissioner or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| So I think, you know, I'm not one of those to keep that we should expand our dos and don'ts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| but I think this is very important that there should be a cutoff time of, say, noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| you know, seven calendar days before the special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| The other thing is in the part, and this is all on page four of your rules, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| and if you look at part C down towards the middle to the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| there's also a caption in there that if a commissioner is appointed to replace an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| that they would have to immediately resign from the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| Well, if, for instance, let's just say Dave Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| his term would be up on August 31st and somehow he got ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| and we needed to replace him on the state legislature on, say, April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=465)|
| 0:07:54| But yet you would only serve from April 1st until, you know, until, say, you know, the August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| There's no reason that you would have to resign your seat as a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| to fill in for four or five months to represent that area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| and you might have two years left on your term or three years on your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| So in West Tennessee, there's actually state representatives that are also county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| And so it is obviously precedent has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| So we may want to consider for our rules that in certain circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| the commissioner does not have to resign his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Obviously, if we were appointing somebody to be a judge who's a commissioner, that's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| But if it's, you know, a short window of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| And so I wanted to kind of throw these ideas out here for the committee to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| And then if we can come to some kind of conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I'd be glad to write it up for the next meeting or however you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| What are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| If you appoint somebody, say, to be the state legislator, and they're in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| and for some reason something happens and we have to appoint one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| then that person's going to go to Nashville on Monday and he will miss the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| which will mean that that commission district will not be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| So you have a problem to take care of representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but I think if you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| there's an advantage of having a commissioner, say, in this case, go to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| because they would understand the procedures and rules, regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| and would probably make a better fit for somebody than just to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| hey, we'll take Bob Jones and send him to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Oh, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I thought you were meaning that you resigned two months or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| No, no, it says you have to – in our rules now, you would have to resign from county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| and then serve two or three or four or five months in the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| and then you're out, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| Yeah, it does say here that he has to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| And we may never have to use this, but at least we'd have it in case it ever comes up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| So in that section at the beginning of – you're talking about C, it's on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| It says the procedure for filling vacancies in elected offices shall be as follows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| in accordance with Tennessee Code Annotated 5-5-1-1 in several charter sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| So we have to look to see how that reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I'm not sure that's in that section, so I don't know how much you can change if it's in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| But they are doing it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Actually, not somebody who was appointed, but somebody who is actually a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| and consequently a state representative at the same time in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So you wouldn't think that would happen, but it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| I'll check it out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| How could you really represent your local people that you're representing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And how can you represent your people on a state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| I mean, this doesn't seem equitable for the people that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=688)|
| 0:11:39| I know when Representative Bright, he still had almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Something close to two years, which is, of course, his aspiration was to re-state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| which is he's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| Why don't you get with Zeal on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| And after she does her research and finds out what the statute says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| and then we bring it back at our next meeting to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Does everybody think that's a good course of action then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| And also the timeline, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| For a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Let's go back to the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| If you want to replace Justin, I think Justin Lampert is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| If Justin resigns and you want to replace him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I was talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| The first part where we had, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| you can't disappoint somebody the day of a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| Well, I called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| That's number two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| That was your number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Number one is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Let's go back to the number one then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Remember, this one that John's talking about is you had three issues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| No, just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| This is the number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| You and Zeal work it out and bring it back before the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| Number one is the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| So let's go back to number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Let's keep them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| So number one, you know, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| It seems logical if you said seven calendar days before a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| that would allow you, you know, if you needed to meet with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| you know, on the weekend or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| you still could have a chance to interview those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I just think it's wrong that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| the day of the meeting that you make that kind of a judicial appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| with not even knowing the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| That's for the elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Only elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Only elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Only elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Not if you want to be on the whatever committee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I was thinking when the notice was put out about the vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| and that there was a time frame on submitting resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| There was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| In the notice that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| I rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Somebody could have said, hey, you know, number, number a, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I'd like to be considered for four appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| And or they just says, hey, it's meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| I want to point Bob Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Not Bob Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| And no chance to even, you know, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Any problem with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| It's however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I mean, that's plenty adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I might stretch it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Because if you get four or five candidates and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Well, we were kind of I guess with the judicial thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| we were kind of really only had 30 days to do something with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I mean, basically, he had to be in place, you know, January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| But yeah, we could have started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| That process could have been started earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| We knew that he was going to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| We didn't have to wait till December to do the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We could have started that process first of November as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I don't think it's appropriate to start that process, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| before someone has actually put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| I mean, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Everybody kind of knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Yeah, but we didn't have it official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| We didn't have it official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| Well, if we put it in our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| they're going to have to make the official one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| It goes in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Yeah, the person resigning or retiring would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Ten days would be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| In what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Ten days instead of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| You know, you guys are the ones that make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| So you're the ones that are going to have to look at maybe one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| like you did in the weather report for the judicial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| You know, whether you want to talk to them individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| or just read their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| You know, it's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Whatever works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It's tough decisions you all are making on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| They're very tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| The only thing I think you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| No, I guess I was thinking about the public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| for special call meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| So if you had it too far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Anyways, I just wanted to cut off for who wants to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| and what the resume is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I can support the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I think that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| The 10 calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| The calendar days might be a little more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| There's a lot of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| That would be in Section A, correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Because if you don't have any contract currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| some of this language would have to remain, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| because I think you can still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| I think this part about allowing registered voters to submit names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I believe that's in the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| So you would just add an additional sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| About the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| You might not be able to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| And then B, most of B would be removed then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| because you wouldn't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Again, some of that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Never mind, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| This is either drive-thru or charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah, that's got to go that way, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| So, Larson, you got any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| No, it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| It all sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I won't have anything to add that you guys aren't already discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| It sounds logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So I suggest that if you would, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| you and Jill get together, write this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and then let's bring it back at our next Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Is that satisfactory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| And that way we can get this language down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I don't want to sit here and start trying to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| well, we can take that sentence out and add this sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| but we don't know really what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| So is that okay with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| That does not require a vote at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Anyone else on the appointment of elected officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| Okay, I brought number six up, I believe, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| It's on Zoom discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| We've got the law department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| Right now, the reason I brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I have no issue with someone being in California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| and the other one was in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| having to come to our meeting for zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| where they could do it over Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| stick it on the airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Now, that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| have we opened up a Pandora's box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| to where someone that lives close by says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| well, I can't make it, so I want to do it on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| And I guess do we need to look at a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| of what qualifies as a Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Because I don't want somebody in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| West Knoxville, whoever, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| well, I can't make the meeting, but I can call in on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Well, that part, if you're that close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| you should be there facing the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| You should be there even if you're opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| or you're the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| You should be there if you're that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| So, you see where I'm going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Have we opened up a Pandora's box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Well, the open meetings law requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I'm paraphrasing, but it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| that there be a quorum in a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| that's advertised the notice that goes out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| That means the quorum has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| And in addition to that, your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| and I've got the civil rules in different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| but it requires witnesses to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Section one, zoning warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| is the commission shall hold a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| And then rule number seven, rezoning request in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| it requires the person requesting a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| to be present at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| If they don't show up, if they're not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| they get put on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| and then if they don't show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| they get put off the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Section B requires witnesses and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| to appear before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| And the order of procedure, section C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| appellant states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| and section F says the applicant's attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| is required for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| The way we had those other two situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| where the children of the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| they had dementia or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| and they couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Section O allows this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| by two-thirds vote, to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| to allow someone to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| You're suspending the rules, did I outline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| To allow them to testify by Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| after a two-thirds vote of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| The Open Meetings Act also has a state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| that says a government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| bottom line on the Open Meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| you have to have a quorum in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| the people who are deliberating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| the people who are considering the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| has to be in a location as advertised in the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| And the purpose is so the public can be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| In that law that requires a quorum to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| there's a subsection that says a governing body may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| but is not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| to allow participation by electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| or other means of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| for the benefit of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| and the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| But still there has to be a quorum present in the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| So what I'm suggesting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| the Tennessee Open Meetings law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| does not forbid you to allow someone to testify by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| But you all have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| And you can set, put in your rules of standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| to allow someone to testify by Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| but I think the proper procedure is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| it be a two-thirds vote by the whole commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| to suspend the rule requiring someone to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| But if you want to set standards on when to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| you by all means can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Well, I can see a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| the chair probably got the phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| that stated that I'm in California or I'm in Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| and I can't be there, can I do it by Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| We didn't know that until we got to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| that it was going to be a Zoom call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| The last one was in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| which I say, you know, they were in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| but I just want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I don't want a problem to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| that we got a big gigantic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| and the developer don't want to face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| you know, the opposition or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| And he said, well, I'm going to do it by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| And am I creating a problem that's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Recognize Mr. Jay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I think that if we put something into writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| that sort of codifies who and who can be on Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| we open it up to more abuse or potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| or manipulation of, you know, finding a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I think right now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| this chairman is usually the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| who would get the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| And, you know, hopefully every chair we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| would use discretion to review the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| and see if it's a contentious case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| probably would not allow it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| allow for some delays or postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| but we're pushed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| I think if we stick with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| we have the ability to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| under really some extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| with the approval of the whole body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| we should just keep it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| But I think if we start layering in specific rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| it's just, you're almost sort of inviting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| more people to go, well, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| what if I could do this or that or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| I'm not sure we need a specific rule right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| You were the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| let me ask this question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| You had the person from California, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| You were chaired in, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| He was the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Did they just call you and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| what was the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Just for information, what was the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Yeah, they contacted the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| you know, which drew, relayed that correspondence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| got the chair involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| We were able to verify that it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I believe it was an extenuating medical circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and then just reviewed the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| It had gone through on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| And I think I had Drew look and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| there weren't any emails in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| or anybody signed up to speak in public order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| It was sort of a clean zoning, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| And so, you know, given that it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| you know, we didn't want to hold up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| somebody's rights of their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| to be able to do it based upon, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| that medical circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And so it was just sort of a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| of a comprehensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| and then bringing that to the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I can't remember, I'm guessing we asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| for a suspension of the rules or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I can't remember the particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| but we did kind of internally review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| and then bring it to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| You want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Sorry, Dr. Eckert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Myers said something and then the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Commissioner Jay said, and he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| If you put it down in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| this is where we will suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| There's always room for loopholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| We're lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| We know that that's the game we play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I think the judges will look at the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| that the commission has in anything it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| as long as it doesn't abuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| My suggestion is you take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| as Commissioner Jay said, like previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| you bring the facts in front of the whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| This person is a son, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| a son and he's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| and his daddy can't talk, he's got dementia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| and then when those facts are before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| you vote on whether or not to suspend that rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| No judge is going to overturn that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| as long as you have the facts in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| and you don't abuse your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| So it's along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| I think you take it on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| and, you know, the commission thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| that it ought to be rules suspended on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Nobody's going to overturn that ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I definitely agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| I think it just opens the can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| I don't remember, did we suspend our rules last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Because I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| I don't remember the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| At some point, we were asking Mr. Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| we were asked this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| if it was appropriate in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| and I frankly had a memo that I'm using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| we made then, that I'm repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| If I remember correctly, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| this person had also attended via Zoom through planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| and she had contacted us if it was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| to do via Zoom the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| because I think it was her father who had dementia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| and could not come in and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| what was going on with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Was the second one, maybe, the same one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| The second one did come through email asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| and if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I think they also attended planning through Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| But I don't understand if it's a big, big project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| and there's millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| they've got lawyers and everything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Why can't they step in for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| and speak to it so we can face them on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I mean, if it's a small project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| and it's two acres of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| the person on there has no money at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| and they live way out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| then I can see maybe looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| But when you're talking about large projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| you've got lawyers that handle all the filings and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| so they can come here and we can ask them questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| in front of us, so I don't see anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| about suspending rules or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| And you've got to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| If they're going to be here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and they're going to be part of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| they don't have a representative here to let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| let us quiz them how they're using our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I was just going to state that there's always the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| of offering a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| The chair can always give that to the person calling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| if the chair feels a little shaky about it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| But here's the other thing that they've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| You've got to educate them when they start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Okay, we're going to go through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| and we're going to give it, and we're going to send it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| to the commission, and we'll send it to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| on X day, and we'll need a representative there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| on that X day for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| You know, we've had local people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| that just ignored it two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| And I think we do things sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| that we disrespect the commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| When we start doing these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| we don't make it as important as it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| Well, the reason I brought that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| and I'm glad that it got dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| That's the great thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Because when I was sitting there at the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| and I knew about it because three minutes beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| because the chairman says the first one's going to be on Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| which was mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And then when he announced it's going to be on Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| I looked across the aisle there, and I seen some faces that go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| eyes got bigger around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| At least give us a heads-up that it's going to be on Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| And we did, but we can't call in, hopefully the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| whoever the chairs are, that they call in on a Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| and say, hey, I'm at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I can't call in on Zoom on that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| I just don't want to get abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I was just going to say, and kind of piggyback on Charlie's statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| any applicant has the option to have their own agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| their own representative before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| even if they live in Texas or California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| They want to search and hire a law firm, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| but I agree it shouldn't be that last minute that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| in that case, it should be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| It's the day of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| I really support that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| letting it be at the chair's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| We are in a really unprecedented time as far as the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| and safety of our people go right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| You could have fully prominent agents appearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| and be told the day before you've got quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| It's just pretty crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I appreciate your recommendation, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| I think that's probably wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| We'll leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| If it ever comes up to an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| we'll bring it back before the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Let's go ahead and do item number seven, schedule our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| We meet every two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I think we need to meet in March because of the two suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| that Commissioner Spoonmaker has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| Are we meeting on the 22nd because of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Is the 21st a holiday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| I don't have-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| We got commissioned on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I think it's the 21st and the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| If there's no holiday on the 21st, it'll be the 21st and the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Can we tentatively schedule March 21st here, same room, 3 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| unless something changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| We won't have a finance committee at that time, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| On that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Next one is tentatively scheduled for March the 21st, 3 o'clock here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| Everybody okay with that, hopefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I do have a other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| I meant to add it to the agenda, but is it all right to go ahead and do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I mean, I guess we can add another business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And it's part of our rules, and it's not against anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and hopefully I'll talk to the chairman about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We have rules set up that if you're going to come to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| you've got to call and get on that list and let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| And here lately, we've got all these people coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| and I'm glad we're coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| But, you know, once they sign up on that list, then the chairman goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| is there anybody else out there who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Well, we're breaking our own rules because, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| they didn't call to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| They didn't come up front to sign up and through before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| And I really think that when we do public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| when public forum is over with, that last person's called, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| That's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Because I think if you really want to talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| you will call Drew and get on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| or you will come and see Drew before 5 o'clock that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| That's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| So that's my little soapbox for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Well, and I think it's working out good that if you do have an agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| you get to go first to the first public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and then all other issues go to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So I think that was one of the best moves that the rules committee did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| was to break that up so that we're not having county people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and the public waiting to go through a whole bunch of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| It's not an agenda issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Well, I've been looking at my clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| The school board got out in seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| The school administration got out in seven minutes last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| We'll see next week if you break the record at seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| For the uses out there, sometimes it's 11, 12 o'clock, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Which I'm going to call for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| All right, any other business before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| All right, motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220118-rules-committee?start=2146)|
