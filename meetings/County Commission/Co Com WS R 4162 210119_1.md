| 2:14:27| finalized by September. So, you could have a reading in September and October. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| would allow anybody who wants to run for school board or county commission, if those seats are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| open, that they would know where they stood. So. Thank you, Commissioner. You make good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| I might just, I think that, let me get just a nod, a thumbs up or a thumbs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8084)|
| 2:14:51| I'm kind of hearing a collective thought that Knoxville, Knox County Planning, Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| KGIS, and the Law Department all might be just resources that we can invite as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| but not actually be voting members on the committee. Is that an accurate statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| everybody agrees with? Seeing lots of nodding heads. Okay. Anybody disagree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| So, that would leave county commissioners, one member, the Board of Education chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| or a chair designee from the school district and the election administrator as our core group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| Is that accurate? Is there anybody we're missing? Okay. And then let me take it a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8127)|
| 2:15:36| I do see your hand up, I think, again, Director Book. So, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| come back to you in just a second, unless that's still your hand up from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| Is there, just by a show of hands, how many people would be interested in serving on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| given that this is likely a, for sure, a once-a-month commitment for multiple hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8151)|
| 2:16:02| Anybody not interested? Let's do that. Anybody not interested in serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| Okay. So, it looks like everybody's interested in serving. So, per Commissioner Stonemaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| recommendation, that would put it, 11 members with two additional, one from the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8174)|
| 2:16:23| one from the elections administration. So, that would be a committee of 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| Not optimal size, but not out of control either. So, I think that would, if everybody feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| comfortable with that, then that would be, I'm seeing lots of nods. Okay. Director Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8193)|
| 2:16:42| did you have something you wanted to chime in on again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| I just wanted to follow through on Chairman Smith's thing. If the ordinance right now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8205)|
| 2:16:55| the school board says that 2-911, there shall be established nine districts. It doesn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8215)|
| 2:17:01| where they've got to be. It doesn't say that it's got to match the commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| because if you look through the ordinance, it itemizes districts by schools. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| something that Chairman Smith was talking about. So, I urge you, and I can send it to you, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| ordinance, which can be changed because it is an ordinance. When you're establishing the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| districts, you may want to keep them the same. You may not. That's up to you. But the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| does set them out by way of where the schools are. And that's all I have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8250)|
| 2:17:37| Commissioner Hill, and then I'll come back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| I'm, I am thinking that that change was actually made 10 years ago. Mr. Law Director, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8261)|
| 2:17:51| recall, that prior to that, they actually did not align. And was it, was it 2011 that then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8271)|
| 2:18:00| they were pulled to share, share boundaries with, with commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8280)|
| 2:18:10| There's nothing in the record, excuse me, that shows that it was made to align. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| the practical thing that evidently they did. They went to District 1 and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| here's all the schools of that district. But there's nothing in the ordinance to indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| that they had agreed to go ahead and do it the same districts that the commission had. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8306)|
| 2:18:34| there was some adjustment on that. Does anybody have a better memory than me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| Commissioner Smith is raising his hand. And, oh, sorry, Commissioner Schoonmaker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Yeah, Commissioner Hill, that was my recollection, that about 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| that was all changed to make it uniform because it used to be that the 5th Commission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| was the 6th School Board District. And that was totally confusing for the, for the populace. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8338)|
| 2:19:06| either it was a memorandum of understanding or some kind of resolution that said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8346)|
| 2:19:16| whatever the Commission District is, will be the School Board District. So, it made it easier for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| the citizens of Knox County. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I remember about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| 2011, yeah. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Huge. Yes, that's what I remember, too. It was confusing for the voters. But it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| did it turn confusing for the parents of students whenever they voted for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| school board rep that did not represent the school that their child went to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| But yes, I don't think there's anything that makes it a binding commitment that they line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| In fact, state statute says that there has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| at least nine school board members in every district. I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| Max. Max, right. Max. But you can have up to, what is it, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| 22 Commission Districts or so? 25, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| 25. Yeah. So, there are places in our state where these don't line up. And I'm not advocating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8420)|
| 2:20:28| anything here. I am just pointing that out that I get that a lot from the people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8428)|
| 2:20:38| the third district's very unique. It has two of the largest private high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| actually three of the largest private high schools in it. And the students from the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| district go to West High School. They go to Bearden, which is in the third. They go to Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| Valley. They go to Carnes. So, I get a lot of that being the representative for the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| Hey, my kid goes to a school where I can't vote for the person that is the representative for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8463)|
| 2:21:10| that school on school board. Thank you very much. Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8470)|
| 2:21:21| And if I may, as just a follow-up, you're exactly right, Commissioner Smith. And my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8481)|
| 2:21:30| and my first comment was that even if you make the district different from what the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8490)|
| 2:21:39| Commission district is, it is a, really, it is a physical, it is not a possibility to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8499)|
| 2:21:54| the schools with a school board member either. It just does not, geographically, population-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8514)|
| 2:22:03| just does not fare it out that way at all. So, it's rough either way. But I do support the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8523)|
| 2:22:10| that at least they aligned school board and commission, if nothing else, and at least when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8530)|
| 2:22:18| a parent or a citizen does vote, they are voting the same district number for both entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8538)|
| 2:22:31| Anyway. I agree with everything you said. I do remember going back there that that's what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| did. I think once it was reapportioned, they went and looked at which schools were in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| that were reapportioned by population. And that's how they came up with this, although it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8564)|
| 2:22:51| reference it. But I don't want to throw a monkey wrench into this, but that's an ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| you all need to consider once you do the reapportionment. If you want to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| schools that way, then you will redo the ordinance on the book the way it was been done, which is fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| the schools in the reapportioned district. So, that has to be done by ordinance also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8589)|
| 2:23:15| CHAIR BAILET Okay. Coming back around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| looks like Commissioner Smith and Schoonmaker. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| COMMISSIONER SMITH I had really intended to lower my hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| but since I went ahead and spoke about this, you know, the last time redistricting took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| I believe it's fair to say that the third district, which was part of the fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| all of Cedar Bluff and West Hills and Cumberland Estates, all the changes and part five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| you know, at one time there was three representatives in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| back whenever we had two in all the other districts. It changed the third district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| very, very drastically. And to Commissioner Hill's point, that is one of the reasons why we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8639)|
| 2:24:08| the third district so many residents that attend a school that's in another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8648)|
| 2:24:16| That is something that, you know, one of the reasons why I want some commissioners on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| committee, and I'm glad we're going to, is because commissioners know their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| better than anybody. You know, yes, we have to work with the numbers, but we have to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| the numbers in a way that keeps our communities together as well as possible. And that's all I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Commissioners, can you make your final thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| COMMISSIONER HICKS. Yes, I just wanted to double check with Law Director Buch. If we do not need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8681)|
| 2:24:48| to set this up as a resolution that says, you know, X number of people are going to be on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| committee, can just the chairman stipulate and by vote, we just say, hey, it's going to be 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| commissioners with the elections administrator and the designee of the chairman of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8700)|
| 2:25:08| County School Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8708)|
| 2:25:09| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. I think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| COMMISSIONER HICKS. Yeah, I think we can do it the same way we've done the other special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| committees. So, that's why I kind of wanted to do it tonight because I could actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| instead of waiting until March, we'd go ahead and put it on for February and get ahead of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| and say this is by, you know, basically creating a special committee and moving forward in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| regard. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| VICE CHAIR TERRELL. Actually, Commissioner Jay, if you wanted to get an even quicker jump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| you could just go ahead and add it. We could add it to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| COMMISSIONER JAY. Okay, I can do that. One of the other notes I had that I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8736)|
| 2:25:41| just kind of wrap up the final conversation on this is I've read a few sort of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| and one of them was to set some goals as a committee. So, that might be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| we can help outline. These are sort of big picture things, but setting goals of what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| our intention, what is our purpose, why are, you know, there's the legal structural side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8760)|

| 2:26:26| lives so you understand, you know, that you might move a line arbitrarily, things like that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| there's lots of that little nuance that we'll get into as committee. So, I'll work on setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| that up for next week. We'll have as an ad. We'll get ahead of it. Part of our job is also to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8797)|

| 2:26:56| and we have a plan, we know what we're doing, and we'll get on it. So, we'll add those. Hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| I can put both of those together for next week. So, seeing no other hands, I'm going to wrap up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| discussion on that. And then I just have two quick items before we conclude our meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| and other announcements as needed. There was one other special committee that was formed when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8831)|

| 2:27:28| to happen this and next month to have engagement with both the Sheriff's Office administration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| the Merit Council. And then I will be bringing those recommendations to you all in two forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8855)|

| 2:28:16| and ahead of time set the budget presentation and bring to you all a plan to go through the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8896)|

| 2:28:29| last minute scramble. So, that will happen soon. Opening up the floor for other announcements or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-4162-210119?start=8909)|
