| 0:01:09| Okay, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Yes, we want to move to postpone 9A for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| Is that the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| That's the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| It's after our last meeting we took the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| and sent them back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| They're going to review it and they'll bring it back to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| We'll have another public meeting and then back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| I think 120 days will give us enough time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Okay, there is a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| A motion and a second. Any discussion on that postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Okay, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| And that is postponed for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| Consent items, that is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| We have one consent item, which is a 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| Okay, for the mayor's report, a few things to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| First of all, last night I want to thank council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| who were able to come to the Mayor's Neighborhood Connection meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| This was a meeting with five neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| actually six neighborhood organizations showed up in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| We want to thank the members and the leadership of Bell Morris Community Action Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| the Brown Avenue Neighborhood Watch, Edgewood Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Fairmont Emeryland Neighborhood Association, Tacoma Watchdog, and the North Hills Garden Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| They all came to the meeting we had at Bell Morris Elementary last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and we were able to listen to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| We answered a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| We heard about some issues that we needed to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| and I appreciate all of my leadership team was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| many of our police officers who work in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| our department heads, and other folks who are out there to serve the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| So we appreciate that, and we look forward to our next Mayor's Neighborhood Connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| If you would like, in your neighborhood, if you would like for us to come out and to meet with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| we encourage you to go to the city website, to the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and fill out a form which basically asks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| you fill that out to show your interest in having a Neighborhood Connection meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Also, I think I told you all that I was going to be going to Charleston, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| for the Mayor's Institute on City Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| I did that last week, spent Wednesday night and Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| I was invited along with seven other mayors from across the country and eight resource people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| city designers, landscape architects, urban planners, folks like that were invited in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| So there are about 20 people in the room, the American Architectural Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| the U.S. Conference of Mayors, they all support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| as well as some private dollars that come to that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| This was the 54th Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Mayor Haslam participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| I believe Mayor Ash was there in previous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| And it was a great opportunity to look at eight different city projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Each of us presented a project and asked for feedback from the mayors and from those resource specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| And so we took a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| I took the Old City project, the plans we are looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| the work we're trying to do to spruce up and work with the business owners and property owners in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| So we will be getting back all of those comments at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| both from all of the city case studies that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| I found it very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| And Mayor Joe Riley, he was one of the founders of the Institute many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| and he participated in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| So it was a really great learning experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Will that be on YouTube anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| No, it's actually kind of off the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| People can just speak and learn and ask dumb questions and provide, you know, whatever dumb inputs you might want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| and it's not on the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| But it was nice to ‑‑ it was really a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Also, today some of us were able to participate in Hispanic Heritage Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| This celebrates the contributions and the culture of Hispanics in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| It's really a nationwide celebration from September 15th to October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| And locally, our group OLA, ORA Latina, they are the sponsors of this, and I was asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| And they have an exhibit at the Knoxville Museum of Art that includes the works from several Hispanic artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| So I encourage you to get out there and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| And on Saturday, October 6th, is the OLA Festival near the Regas Square up in the north end of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| I encourage everybody to come out and enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Also, the city, in conjunction with Construction Specifications Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| will be holding its first East Tennessee Accessibility Event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| This is a day‑long event that will showcase how to create access for people with disabilities and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| And as our population begins to age, and as you all know, I had a big birthday recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| we start tuning in to the needs for visitability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| homes that are friendly and visible for folks as they age, as well as for those with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| So our ADA coordinator, Stephanie Cook, is helping to spearhead this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| which will bring architects, designers, and builders together to talk about what accessibility means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| and to help offer solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| So that's on Friday, September 21st, at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| It's from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| It's free, but there's a $20 cost for lunch in the panel discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And this also offers CEU credits of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| So that's good if you're interested in accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Hope you'll attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Another thing, Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| There will be a ribbon cutting for Morningside Park on Tuesday, the 25th of September, at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| You may recall that Pilot donated $250,000 to the city to make Morningside Park more user‑friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| with upgrades to the disc golf course, additional accessible parking spaces, and more things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| So the public is invited to attend and tour this upgraded park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| That's Tuesday at 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| And finally, next week, we'll be kayaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| We're going to test another new kayak launch that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| which is at the forks of the river on the corner of Island River Drive and Waterplant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| This put‑in area will feature new Blueway signage so paddlers can find the next access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| This will be the first Blueway signage in our Parks and Recreation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| So that's at 3 o'clock next Wednesday, the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I'm going to be kayaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I hope some of you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| And if you need a boat, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| But come join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It'll be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Hopefully the weather will be good for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| So that is the end of my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| So, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| I just wanted to just talk about Diana Kahn for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| She lost her battle with cancer last week, and she was a real pioneer, if you will, for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| I don't think there was ever a community meeting that I was aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| She wasn't there and active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| She loved South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| She loved everyone over there, and everyone over there loved her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| And she'll be truly missed, not only just South Knoxville, but people throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| And I know that they're having the receiving of Friends is Saturday at 1 o'clock at St. Luke's Episcopal Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| and then the service will be at 2 o'clock following the Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| So, you know, I just want to acknowledge and celebrate her life because she was just a true battler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| and somebody that just was really interested in what was happening in her community and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| So I wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And then I'll be having my coffee with the councilman not this Saturday but the following Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=583)|

| 0:10:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| I wanted to say I was honored to be at the O'Connor Center today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Speaking of aging, the senior softball league had a potluck lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| and they were singing the praises of parks and recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| and also the previous mayors and all that they did to get that set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| And I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed being with them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| And the oldest person was 83 years old who was playing softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| So I had a good time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Also I'll mention that I'll be going to Washington later on this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| to attend the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation meetings, and I'm looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| And there will be some discussions on problems and situations with urban cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| So I'm looking forward to attending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Did you play softball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I may play next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Were you a designated runner for that 83-year-old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| I probably couldn't run as fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| The Westview Community Group is meeting Thursday night, this Thursday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| at 7 p.m. at Westview Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| And among the topics of discussion will be the Westview Historical Cemetery District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| and you'll be hearing more about that as that gets nearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| I want to express my concern for the amount of recent violent crimes that we've seen in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=701)|
| 0:11:52| And I've heard from a number of business people both on the east side and the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| and the north side that are concerned about the shootings that have happened recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| particularly one that happened a couple weeks ago out on the city street in front of Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| It's a concern for the businesses and a concern for the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| and I would like to ask if Chief Roush could expound on that and what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| We're doing all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you, Mayor and Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| I can tell you, number one, is we're not seeing any kind of an uptick in violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| It's not to downplay the activities that have happened, but there is no trend that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=750)|
| 0:12:41| And in particular, the incident you mentioned, we obviously have put our efforts in the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| We've identified individuals involved, and we're presently working on picking them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| And there are always, in these situations, there's always more than what you see and what you hear that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| And so we don't share a lot of that because it's pertinent to the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| and pertinent for us later on in the attempt to do a prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| So we don't always release everything we know so that we can be successful in combating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| and holding someone accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| And we have had a couple over in those areas, and we had a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| We had an incident there, and that one was resolved pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| A suspect is in custody, and we're looking for another that was involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| And, you know, the thing that I would ask is that, as folks in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| what you can do to help us is I'm a firm believer in the community's our eyes and ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| and they're the ones that can help us be successful in these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| People see things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| They need to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| We've run into times where we walk into a crowded place and where an incident has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| and then everybody walks away and no one will step forward and help us to resolve the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| And when people know things and they see things, it's important that they get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| I just want to make sure that we're doing all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I mean, I know this really impacts businesses and lives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| And I appreciate all you do, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Mayor Brown, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Yes, I wanted to make a mention in conjunction with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| I got an e-mail, I guess all of us did, on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| And I don't know who actually is sponsoring a march and rally against violence that's going to be held at the Walter Hardy Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=877)|
| 0:14:47| on Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I'm not sure what organization is sponsoring that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| but it is in conjunction really with what Councilman Wallace is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And I'm not sure of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I think it's 2 p.m. on September 29th at Walter Hardy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| I showed the parade being from 1 to 2 and then the rally afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| And it's Pastor Kevin Perry from Word of Life Ministries is who approached me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=915)|

| 0:19:37| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate something that the Chief had mentioned last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and that is any community group that's going to have a night out celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| should contact the police department because they'd like to have an officer present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| to participate with you and to help make it a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| And that's a good suggestion that they just contact that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| What number should they call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Probably easy to just call the general number, 215-7000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| and they'll get them directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Oh, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| I just wanted to make clear that we're not just playing around for an hour or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| that there are quite a few neighborhood night out events throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| I'm really curious to see how Mayor O'Hara takes them all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| because they're from one end of the city to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| We will have to all divide up our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| She can ride with all of the at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| My district has four, and one of the groups graciously moved theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Cumberland Estates, to October 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So that kind of cut down on my travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| But this, I think, is a very good thing to have the neighborhood night out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| and I just want the taxpayers to understand that we're not sloughing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| We will be on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1254)|

| 0:21:26| Motion D, a resolution approving the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| and reinstatement of the City of Knoxville's A-Series VIL-1 loan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| with the Public Building Authority of Sevier County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| and B-Series A-4A loan agreement with the Public Building Authority of Blount County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| directing the conversion of the interest rate on the related local government public improvement bond series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1304)|

| 0:22:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I just want to say thanks to giving me extra time to study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| I did talk with Joe Ayers last week and Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| and Jim York provided a bunch of additional information, and I think it's good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| But Joe's here if you all want to ask him anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Let me second the notion that this is a good thing for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| As I read the information sheet, and as Jim York has explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| there's a chance that they could save $1.2 million a year in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| Obviously, we'll be at risk with the variable rate, but we have the right to refinance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| So it's certainly a smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| And the other piece of this was that it took away from the refinancing lender the right to put for at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| So we're more or less in the driver's seat for that first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| So it's a good piece of work that helps the city function and saves us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| Mr. Ayers, would you like to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| I think Councilman's conclusions are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Joe Ayers, Kremlin Securities, 813 North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| On one of the loans, which is the Series 6L1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| the new credit facility actually goes to the final maturity of the bonds, which is eight years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| So that takes away all the refinancing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| On the other one, we do extend it out for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| and the credit pricing on these new transactions are substantially below the current credit pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| So your assumption on the savings is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And as most of you know, these two loans were originally used to build the new convention center approximately ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| And the variable rate piece of the larger loan is mostly offset by the city's tremendous fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| as it relates to an asset liability hedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you, Mr. Ayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Okay, this is going to require a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1450)|

| 0:25:56| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I see we have Bob Wetzel back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| It's good to see him back, hip and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| And if you could maybe tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| In particular, I noticed that some of the charges in the back are sort of a holdover of phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| It's almost as if we spent more than we planned to, and they're picking up the tab in phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| as well as doing the additional both geotechnical and engineering work to find out where to put those piers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| and how to build this thing safely and what it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| That's a good, close reading of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| We'll come back to that here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| We've brought some pictures down the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Would you like for us to put those up before we're going to have a little bit of discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Would that be the will of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| We're a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Council, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Pictures are always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Don Michelle is going to help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Otherwise, she would be here and I would be there, but with the leg like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| So what we have here is we had a $666,000 grant from TDOT, which includes our local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| We entered into roughly half of that contract back in 2010 with Lori and Associates to do a conceptual study for the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1625)|
| 0:27:15| for the pedestrian bridge from, as it turns out, the University of Tennessee campus over to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| This was a bridge that was identified in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| The South Waterfront Administrator and the past administration worked to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| We picked it up in January, as you know, and the whole South Waterfront project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| and have moved this project a little bit farther here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Nobody has been asked to make final decisions on it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| but we would like to get the rest of the TDOT money committed so we can get to the end of the conceptual design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| and to the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| So we're moving towards getting the project construction ready at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| That's where we need to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| It's obviously an expensive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| There's no money in the budget right now to build a bridge, but there is some money to do continual exploration on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and that's what we're hoping to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Is part of the exploration looking for people who would help finance the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| That's always a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, obviously, when you look at the bridge, there's three parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| There's the part across the river, which is pretty public, and you land on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| You land on the University of Tennessee on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| The south side lands among private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| and there's been some discussions with private property owners about some development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| We've had one group very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| If that bridge was being built today, you would probably have a group looking at a $50 million development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| on the south side right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| We're not there, and we've told them we won't be there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| So, you know, they've kind of gone home for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| But they'll say they may come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| But, yeah, we'll be looking for all sorts of partners as we go forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| I don't think it's an unreasonable thing we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Certainly, it's a big idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| It's a big expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| But it's the kind of thing that moves cities forward if that's what we choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I think it's a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| But this part of the contract will take about a year, year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| and during that period of time we'll be meeting with the council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Certainly, the new council folks have not had a vote on this one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| So you'd be the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| This will be your first vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| But there will be more down the road before we undertake this type of big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Bob, could you address the part about the carryover costs, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| As I understand it, there were a number of things going on late in the last administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| There were a lot of meetings held with the University of Tennessee to make sure that they were on board with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| and they felt good about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| And Bob Bowers is here, and he can give the details if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| But as they kept going back to UT, they kept asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and they kept asking questions, they kept producing documents, and they kept producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| So these firms, which are all local firms, said, yes, we'll work now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| on the understanding that probably the city, they worked in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| they worked at risk that the city would go forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| and do this next half of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| As I saw it, it was $63,000 in the back and some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Those are some of the documents that actually led to some of these high-class graphics that we have here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| that we're trying to visualize so you can kind of get the idea of where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| This is obviously a spectacular looking bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Now part of the next stage is to decide, can you get the foundations into the banks to make it work just like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| That work has to go on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| That's because of the geology of solution channels and limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| I'd say it's geology, geography, and geometry all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| They all come into play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Three Gs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Well, I just wanted to, what you told me, I want to make sure that we understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| This money has been earmarked for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| It's not like we're taking it away from anything else and we can't use it for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| It's really earmarked for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And it was provided to us in a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| And if we don't have it spent down the TDOT portion by 2014, then we lose that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I remember when this project came to a previous council and there was a very elaborate presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| and I think that the concept has some real pluses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| I also think that when the Henley Street Bridge was development or redevelopment occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| that a big piece of that was to have pedestrian and bicycle access that would be bringing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| from South Knoxville closer to the heart of the city rather than onto the UT campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| where there's some distance from getting into the heart of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| So I have a lot of reservations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I understand that money is in the bank and it's itching to be spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| and so I understand all that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| But I do want to go on record as having a whole lot of reservations about this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| at this particular location and not having a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| $20 million will do a lot of things for this city, and that's the long-term projected cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| And so I'm very concerned in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I'm concerned that we need to be getting people downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| and that the comments I've had from folks is that while this is good to help UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| it's good to help people who come to the games, basketball and football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| What's it really going to do to put dollars in the pocket of the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| So I have those serious reservations, and I just need that on the record now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| So noted, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| There are a lot of benefits, but we won't get into all that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| We maybe want to do another workshop on this in the next year with all this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| until we can have a real elaborate discussion of those concerns because they're very real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| I mean, we can try to address some of those tonight if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| That's all right. We need a much longer time than we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Yeah, that's what I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Yeah, we'll schedule the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| I'm going to address a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| So, I mean, it's unusual that I have a district that's separated by a river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| and this, you know, looking at it, you know, I'm excited, cautiously optimistic, I guess, is what I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=1989)|
| 0:33:21| But, you know, the potential for what this does, number one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| obviously it changes the whole skyline of the city of Knoxville, and it would be a tremendous addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| like a lot of bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Charleston, we were just there, and I was just there, and we weren't together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| I don't want this to be, you know, we've got the press here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I was at one Isle of Palm, and she was in Charleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| But their bridge there is magnificent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| I mean, it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And so that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| But to connect and to continue with what is going on in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and to connect the University of Tennessee with the South Knoxville would be a boon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I don't think there's any doubt that there will be tremendous economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| and there will be a lot of renovation and restoration of homes that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| So I agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| That's a lot of money, but, you know, it's money that's earmarked, and we either use it or lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| And obviously the city has, you know, a stake in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| But we're to this point, you know, I would, you know, obviously I'm going to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| and I would hope my fellow members on council would support it to get it to the next level and see where we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| But, you know, I'm cautiously optimistic and excited at the same time that this could come to fruition in years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2071)|
| 0:34:40| But I just know that it would be to lend itself to the money, to the waterfront, to the urban wilderness trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| I mean, it just ties in with everything that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| So I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Councilman Dalbock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| I certainly support completing the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| I think when we tackled this probably in the fall of last year sometime, we were looking at what's it going to take to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2099)|
| 0:35:08| Is it buildable in that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| What is the geology and the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| But Brenda certainly raises a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I think I raised it back in November whenever we did this, that we certainly want to see if we can find partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| and I mentioned that to you, who have an interest and who will benefit from this to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| But we've got to know if it's doable and what it will cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And certainly we've had a pretty exciting think tank team working on designing a first-class bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2134)|
| 0:35:43| I mean, that's important, but cost will certainly be a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| But that's down the road when we get down to what's it going to cost and is it buildable at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| So I hope your team will be beating the bushes and finding the TDOTs and the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| and the UT fans that want to sponsor that connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| That's the good part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| And I could imagine right now there would be a half-dozen student housing projects by private developers going up if they had the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2166)|
| 0:36:16| But, again, we can't be everyone's piggy bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| So we hope you'll work on that piece, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| For it to work, it will have to be a community project and we'll have to have lots of partners to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you all for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2190)|

| 0:36:36| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Hey, Bob, if you could send the new guys the presentation they gave the last time by e-mail or something, that might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| We'll find out what that is and we'll get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| 12A, an ordinance to amend Chapter 10, Article 2, Electrical Code, Sections 10-36, 10-37, 10-46, 10-48, and 10-51 of the Code of the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2210)|

| 0:37:50| We're now to the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| We have one person signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Leslie Gengozian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Please come and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I think you know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| You have up to five minutes by council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Nice to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| My name is Leslie Gengozian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Sorry, I mispronounced that, Leslie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| It happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| My address is 1626 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I live in the Park Ridge community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And I'm here to discuss an opportunity that I had a couple of years ago to have a new roof put on my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| And this was through the Empowerment Zones My Front Yard program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| I actually had two different individuals refer me to the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| One thought I might want to paint my house because it's pink and he didn't like the pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| Somebody else realized that I really needed a new roof, not because it was leaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| but because my property had been a rental property for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| And when that happens, occasionally there's patches done and sections of roofing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| And to make a long story short, one side of my roof had seven layers of shingle and tar paper on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| And so I went ahead and applied for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I was accepted for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Into the demolition, it was discovered that I had no plywood sheathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| And the grant program allowed for $49.99 to come from the Empowerment Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| with the homeowner paying the balance due on a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| And so in this particular case, by the time I added the plywood, the balance due that I paid was about $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| And I will say that it has made a tremendous difference in my utility bills for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| This winter even the summer, even with all of the heat, my highest bill has just been over $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| So I feel pretty happy about all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| However, there are some serious issues with the construction of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| And I have made a number of complaints with the Community Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| the first one being probably within the first six months after completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| It was pointed out to me that my flashing was not caulked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| The point, in fact, is my flashing was not tucked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| And so there were open spaces all over my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| The roofer came in and applied some caulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| And then last October, I noticed some stains in my hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| And I had been noticing some urine odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| And I do keep cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And I thought, well, maybe they're just arguing with the raccoons outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| And then I noticed the brown stains on my ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I complained again to Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I said, we've really got a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I've got moisture coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| And nothing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| And finally in March I wrote about a two-page letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| And for the past six months I have been in negotiations over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| They have sent an inspector who took photos of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| And I'll give you a copy of that report now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2452)|
| 0:41:16| The first six pages of this document are the inspector's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| You can see that the flashing was applied to the exterior of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| In other pages, I believe it's – let me thumb through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Well, I thought I had everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| In other pages, you will see wide gaps where there have been spaces left open under the eaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| For example, it's a folk Victorian with multiple roof lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| And so where there are intersections, there's a gap that has to be filled in in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| And there are holes there, which led to rodents getting into my attic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| To make a long story short, at first the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| wanted me to work with the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| However, because of a couple of instances of discrepancies in conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| I prevailed and asked if I could just seek new quotes, and I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| I made my best efforts anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| I was in touch with four different roofing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| I got quotes from two of them, and only one of them is considered viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| because only one of them is itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| That quote is for $8,800, which is just less than what my roof cost originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| But the additional problem arises in that all of my insulation in my attic has been soiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| A quote to replace the insulation is approximately $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Another quote to repaint my ceilings, to recover from the urine stains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and to kill the odor is approximately $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| So, in short, I'm looking at a $14,000 tab or thereabouts to repair a $9,000 roofing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2582)|
| 0:43:12| I don't know exactly where I go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I have negotiated in good faith with Community Development for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| However ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Ms. Chingos, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Oh, is that what that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| I'll move to give her additional three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| If there is no objection from counsel, then you have an additional three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Just to point out a couple of other things, then, in looking at the home inspector's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| on the last page the home inspector cites me for homeowner maintenance, keeping the gutters clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| why have the gutters not been properly secured, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| The gutters were reapplied by the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Further, the only pictures that he shows of my gutters shows them clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| So I'm not sure what he saw that he thought was dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| But this was really about the only thing he cited me for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| There was also a drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The contractor dug the drain ins right next to my brick foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Let's be clear that this is a 1902 Victorian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| It is in Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| It does have a brick foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I have added a sump pump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I have had floors jacked up in three areas before I realized what the problem was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| I do have erosion in my crawl space from the flooding in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| I'm not sure if council can help me in any way, shape, or form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| but I did want to make you aware of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| This was federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| It was designed to help a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| It has not helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| And if I have to go to my insurance company for repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| then I am flagged for something that is not in any way, shape, or form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| or anything that I have caused to have happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| And so I'm asking for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| and perhaps a little assistance with lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| My request of this Community Development Department was for the $14,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| an additional 50% to be held in reserve in case there were other issues discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| once roof work commenced again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| and another 50% for my time and effort and sleepless nights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| because this has been going on for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| The stains have been evident for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| It's been six months since this report was generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| and I will be doing another one within the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| to see if there's been further damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| And thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Council, and Ms. Gingos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| I will tell you I saw last night on Facebook where you had posted about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| This morning I emailed our, maybe even last night actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| our Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| I got a summary of the situation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and I see that you also emailed my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| We'll be in touch with you to schedule another meeting to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Councilman Delovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Mayor, I was going to ask you if Tom Reynolds, our building codes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| had been out there to just look at the physical structure at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| I don't know if we've taken a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| He's obviously gotten a private report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| and I didn't know if we had our own building people take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| I will certainly make myself available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I am concerned for the integrity of the structure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| There's moisture, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Every time it rains I can smell the animal urine coming down from my ceilings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| And I have a dropped ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| My house was built with 12-foot ceilings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| There is a dropped ceiling in every room except for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| and it is the dropped ceilings that are showing the stain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| and the moisture damage the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| I'm calling Christy Branscombe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| I spoke with Becky Wade and Christy about this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Christy, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Yeah, we can send out our inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| or we can also offer to look at an independent inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and do an assessment of the home and see what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| So I think after this meeting, and you're going to be meeting with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| we'll be happy to help you try to sit down and figure out what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| I just want to say, I mean, there are simple things that people can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and maybe the codes folks could point it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| but if the gutters are too close to the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| you can buy a $5 plastic pipe at Lowe's and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| pump the water away from it just by letting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Yes, I've already paid to have that addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Maybe our technical guys can look at that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| And thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120918?start=2859)|
