| 0:00:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| We have four items on the agenda to discuss today, and we're going to go along with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| I know that there are a number of folks here who want to also discuss another item, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| we're going to give you the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| So I just want you to know that you will be given an opportunity to address Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| What I would like to do first is call on Dr. McIntyre and also India Kincannon, the School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| Board Chair, if you would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| And Commissioners, the way we'd like to do this, we're not having formal presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| This is more of an opportunity to ask questions and to give them an opportunity to make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| statements that they wanted to make to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| So with that, Ms. Kincannon, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| Thank you, Chairman Hammond, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| I just want to, first of all, thank all of you for taking the time to meet with Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| and the budget staff individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| It's a lengthy budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| It's something that the Board has worked hard on, and I appreciate you taking the time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| study it and ask questions in those one-on-one meetings, as well as any questions you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| As you know, the Board of Education approved our budget in April, and the budget that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| Board approved is the same as the one that the Mayor is recommending, and I want to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| publicly thank Mayor Burchett, John Troyer, and the rest of his finance staff for communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| really closely with the school system on developing this budget, because I think it behooves our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| students and teachers when we work together and have a good idea of what our budget's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| going to be as early as possible, because that means that we know what teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| resources will be in place for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| I think it's a fiscally responsible budget that puts our focus on instructional resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| and I'm going to let Dr. McIntyre go into a few more details, but I'm here if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| I'm the Superintendent of Schools, and we're at 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, and thank you to Ms. Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| for the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| As she said, I believe this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| This is a reasonable, a conservative, and a very instructionally focused budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| fiscal year 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| The adopted budget is a balanced budget at $385 million, representing a modest increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| of just over 1% over fiscal year 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| The budget shows revenue increases based on just natural growth in expected revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| and that revenue growth amounts to approximately $4.99 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| When we first started developing this budget, we looked at our fixed costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| It was pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| We looked at an initial sort of first blush, about $14.3 million when you look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| like step increases, utilities, debt service, sort of those fixed cost items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| Pretty substantial fixed costs that we had to grapple with, and really we had to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| reductions, reallocations, efficiencies, or additional revenue in order to balance this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| budget, which we have worked hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| I think one of the themes that we experienced for this budget is that we have worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| hard to make reductions in administrative and operational areas, and in particular in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| our central office, to be able to reinvest those resources in classroom instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| I think you see that throughout this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| You see that theme play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| In terms of general funded teacher positions at the school level, it's basically steady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| You see a net increase of about four overall teacher positions in the school district going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| from FY11 to FY12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| There are some increases and decreases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| We allocate our resources to schools based on projected enrollment, and so you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| see where a school had a decrease in enrollment, a slight decrease in positions, or a slight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| increase in positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| But overall, in terms of the net general funded teacher positions, we're looking at an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| of four positions overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| This budget does contemplate a step increase for both certified and non-certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| You may remember that we did not give a step increase to non-certified employees last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| and also incorporates the assumption that the proposed increase in salary that the Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| has proposed for state workers and for teachers of 1.6% on the state portion of our salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| schedule would also move forward in FY12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| In terms of the central office, in this budget you see a net reduction of 17 positions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| our central office out of a total of 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| That's a reduction of basically about 8% of our entire central office in a single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| We have some national statistics that I've shared with commissioners and with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| that suggest that we're actually a fairly lean operation in terms of our central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| when you look at similar sized school districts around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| But despite that, wherever we can make reductions and operate more efficiently in our central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| office and be able to use those resources to support classroom instruction, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| In fact, we have done that in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| One of the dynamics that you do see in this budget is that the federal stimulus dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| do end and so we see a reduction in one of our, I think, key strategies which is instructional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| These are some of our very best teachers who really assist and support our other teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| in their classroom instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| We're going from about 95 of those positions to about 45 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| But we knew that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| We used those resources wisely for the two years that we had them and that was just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| natural decline that we knew was going to occur in this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Another major dynamic, I think, in this budget is the fact that we do have, for fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| 12, resources associated with the federal education jobs bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| We have a little over $7 million to apply to fiscal year 12 and to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| if we did not have those resources available for this one-time use in fiscal year 12, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| would be a far more difficult and challenging budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| That's a substantial support for the coming year, but again, as I've mentioned to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| the commissioners individually, those resources do go away at the end of fiscal year 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| As we begin the fiscal year 13 budget discussion, I think we'll have some difficult choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| to make and I think we'll have some real challenges ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| We really do want to begin our fiscal year 13 budget discussions probably sometime early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| this fall so that we can begin to think about some of the longer term strategies for efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| and reallocation and reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I would also note that the fiscal year 12 budget, despite some of the challenges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| the fact that resources are tight, does include a few key instructional investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| Those include the development of a new STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| high school that we're opening, as you know, in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| We're expanding the Kelly Volunteer Academy to really go year round, including a summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| This is our school at the Knoxville Center Mall and it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| They have their first graduation coming up in a few days and we want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| we continue to support students who have struggled elsewhere academically in a more comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| high school setting that are finding success in this smaller, sort of unique, non-traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| We are extending our very successful formative assessment system, discovery education, down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| to grades 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| We've had it in grades 3 through 8 and in high school and we're extending that to grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| This is great data for our teachers to have, to be able to use to inform their instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and to maximize their effectiveness as instructional professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| And then also, we'll be talking tonight with the Board of Education a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| a strategic compensation initiative to target additional compensation to our teachers in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| ways that support student learning and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| So we'll talk conceptually about that with the Board tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| A proposal will come forward to the Board of Education in June, but that initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| is fully funded outside of the general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Those are dollars that we got from Race to the Top, the Race to the Top competition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| the Innovation Acceleration Fund from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| So I think that's an exciting investment that is moving forward in fiscal year 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And of course, this budget continues our commitment to some of our key instructional strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| like professional learning communities, our leadership academy for the next generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| of great school leadership, and our excellence through literacy efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| One of the things this budget does not fully fund that we're still working on is mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| textbooks and there's been some discussion, although there's been no decisions or no assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| built into this budget, but we have put out an RFP for custodial outsourcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| And that's a situation where if we can identify savings while still maintaining a high quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| level of service in terms of the cleanliness of our buildings, it's something that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| an obligation to at least explore and look at and take a look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| So that RFP comes back in a couple days and we'll make an assessment and I'll make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| to the Board of Education moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| So in summary, again, it's certainly a challenging budget in terms of the limited resources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| we have available, but I think it's a very reasonable budget, I think it's a conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| budget, and I think, as Ms. Kincannon noted, it's a very instructionally focused budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| for fiscal year 2012 for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I'll be glad to take any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Sure, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And I'd like to call attention to Dr. McIntyre's tie, very fashionable today, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| We were just at Sammy Hill reading, the First Lady was reading to, First Lady Haslam was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| reading to youngsters, and I made the mistake of wearing a primary color tie to a pre-kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So you can imagine it's got a few stains and dings and wrinkles on it now because the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| enjoyed it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| We have been meeting individually with Dr. McIntyre and his staff, and so I'm sure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| number of questions have been asked, but are there any other questions or any that commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| have for Dr. McIntyre or Ms. Kincannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Yes, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Dr. McIntyre, we discussed this in our meeting, but that was before we got the Mayor's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=644)|
| 0:10:55| budget, which for the fourth year leaves out any raise for all county employees other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=655)|
| 0:11:07| than the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Under the step increase here, you mentioned in parenthesis it says $2.9 million is subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| to negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| How do we, sitting up here, justify approving raises, step raises, whatever kind of raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| you want to call to the school system when the rest of the county employees are not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Tell us what we can do to justify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Well, you know, Commissioner, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| I certainly don't make, as you know, recommendations or the Board doesn't make decisions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| the county side of decisions that are made in terms of compensation here, so I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| really speak to that side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I will say that in terms of the teachers, the two components that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| for teachers and other certified staff, the step increases, in fact, have been negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| and those are a part of our memorandum of agreement, and if they were to not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| we'd have to negotiate that and have the Knox County Education Association agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| You may recall that last spring, in fact, I asked our teachers not to take a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| We negotiated that with the negotiating team for Knox County Education Association, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| ultimately the rank and file voted to not approve that particular, to forego that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I think that, you know, we don't have full control over that, and then I think in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| of the 1.6% increase for certified employees, which translates roughly to a 1% increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| in terms of overall compensation for teachers and other certified employees, that's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| not discretionary, that if, in fact, the legislature passes the budget that the Governor has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=779)|
| 0:13:08| we will be required to provide that additional compensation to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| That's simply not an option that we have to say we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| So, and that does come with some state dollars, but locally we end up paying, it's about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| $3.15 million cost to that, and we end up paying a little over half of that locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| Well, you understand my viewpoint in this, when you've got 150 people sitting out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| they look at this budget and they see schools get increases, the rest of the county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| don't, everybody, you know, when you've got tough times, everybody has to row their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| of the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| The fact that the teachers voted to not give up that raise last year, when we were in tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| times then, and here we're going to come along here and do it again, I mean, I would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| that they are underpaid and needed, but so are a lot of our county employees, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| disturbing to me that we can't all row the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| I think there needs to be, there needs to be some give and take from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=854)|
| 0:14:24| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| This comment I want us to maybe be thinking about, this is not on the budget, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| I'm just thoroughly impressed with, Amy, what's going over at your school over there at Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I'm real impressed with the principal and the test scores that are coming in over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And I'd mention this to the superintendent, Dr. McNaughton, I think you're doing a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I think, you know, your heart's in the right place and you're not wanting to go to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| level, you're looking past the state and wanting to go, you know, you're looking overseas and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| seeing what people overseas are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| You're really wanting to make this a world-class school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| What I'd like for us to be thinking about, commissioners, is possibly, and I've mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| this to the superintendent, sometimes his hands are tied with what he can do and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| he can't do and what the teachers can do in the class, whether it be from the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| or from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And I've approached him saying, thinking about, what if you didn't take federal money or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| if you didn't take the state money, whichever, you know, is holding your test scores back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| into whatever you all need to move the kids quicker and faster and learn quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| What if we kick that money out and then Knox County took up the, absorbed a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Because I think the community is behind our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| They're behind their education because they know that's what's, from what graduates here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| is what's going to be into the business world and to the doctor's field and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| And we want smart, educated people out there to build a better community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| So be thinking about that and maybe in the future if you said, you know, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| to do something unprecedented, we're not going to take, whether it's federal or state, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| Thomas, you can take a look at that and if there's something, you know, I think the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| would get behind you if it wasn't, you know, as long as it wasn't, you know, double the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| size of this or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| But if it was something that maybe we could do that would enhance and you all in the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| line, the teachers could do a better job and the teachers wouldn't be held back from doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| something that they just hate doing, that doesn't get the kids smarter, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| I'd be in favor of taking a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I want to look outside the box on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| And I think largely, in large measure, the federal resources and state resources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| we have, some do come with some constraints and with some strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| But lately, especially, you'll see a lot of the federal dollars, I think, of late, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| idea is to provide them as dollars that can be used for innovative purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| So things like Race to the Top, while it has to be focused on things like great teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| and leaders and using data to inform instruction, those are really the only parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| There's some substantial accountability parameters and reporting parameters, but in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| how we use those dollars, it's been more flexible lately than probably in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| So I think that's a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| And I appreciate that because I appreciate your sentiment because I think fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| 13, you know, we're going to start without the federal education jobs bill money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| We're going to start a little bit behind the eight ball to start that fiscal year 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| And I think we're going to have to make some tough choices and really think about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| level of investment that we make in public education here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And I appreciate Commissioner Brown's comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| I would only say this, I think, you know, when you look at what we pay our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| compared to other, you know, other communities, actually even some that are very close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| we're not nearly the highest in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| I think we're about 33rd or 34th among the school districts in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| in terms of the compensation we provide for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| And so we do need to be careful about that as well because we want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| they feel valued, that they feel like they are paid like professionals because Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| and Maryville really aren't that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| And it's not that far a commute to get another $6,000 or $8,000 in terms of additional compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| So I appreciate your comments, but I also just want to be very, you know, careful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Mr. Chairman, I think, you know, that would help them work with the charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| I mean, they're in competition with charter schools down the road and if Knox County took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| the lead and said, no, we don't want the state money and or the federal whatever, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| send a message to the state and to the federal level saying, we think we're doing a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| good job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Our test scores are showing what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| So I think it would send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for a lot of your responses because you probably answered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| lot of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| In terms of the dollars that have been coming, I agree, it's getting better as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| I mean, I think these stimulus dollars, the only hooks were making sure the monies were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| spent the way that they were proposed to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And your comments were very timely as it relates to the competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| Thirty-third out of what, 95 systems, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| I think there's 95 counties, there might be 130, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| 130 systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| You know, we're, us being the third largest population, speaks well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| The fact that we don't have these charter schools coming in, in big numbers like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| other urban areas have, is because we're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| I agree with you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| There's a lot of great things going on at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And Austin-East has been just a, I don't know if you all followed the track, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| look at the graduation rates, you look at the assessment, the test scores, it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| So I don't want to, again, throw out the baby with the bathwater saying that these federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| funds coming in were just, you know, had more hooks than benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| I think that would be an overstatement at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| And I think what we need to focus on is the fact that a community, an entity, values certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| And that value is shown a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| And one way of valuing an employee, a system, an entity, is through funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| I think we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| It's not the all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| I mean, you know, you can make a system more efficient, you can make a car more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| but eventually you've got to give it some fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| So you know, this 1%, I guess is going to come out of our budget, one, it's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| to catch us up with those other 32 entities, systems that are higher paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| And money is not everything, and that's why we've been able to retain these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| But it is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So this 1.6%, 1% coming from the county is, I think, money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| And it's balanced by a very modest increase in the overall school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| You know, you all know I was, sat here last year, you know, asked some hard questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| about central office, about staffing levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| I think the superintendent has been responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| But I'm also asking hard questions about teacher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Where do we need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| It's not number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| No one's trying to get to number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| But if we really want to get a world-class school where, would you have a 100% graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| rate, 90, was it 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| The number of students finishing high school, 90% graduating with a regular diploma, at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| least 90% taking the ACT, and at least 90% scoring a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| And this is by what year, Yosh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1319)|
| 0:21:59| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I mean, that's the trajectory that we've set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| So we've set that as an expectation and this community has gotten behind that as a goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| as not a goal, but something that we're going to get to by 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Maybe sounds like a long time away, but we've got a long way to go to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| And that's, those are very aggressive goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| So, you know, I think going forward, our budgets, we're going to have to look at them with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| If we're about excellence in schools, then this is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I didn't mean to come across a while ago as anti-education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| And I think Dr. McIntyre would tell you the fact that we had a discussion about this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| my comment to him was that education is the only way out and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| But when you get down to a point where there are no more dollars left, you have to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| a real hard look at what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| I appreciate everything Dr. McIntyre and his staff do and the time I spent an hour or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| with them three or four weeks ago and most of my questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Those of us with kids in the schools, I mean, Amy and Jeff and myself, you see it every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| day and you get a real hands-on sort of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| And I understand, we've heard, I've heard as a commissioner from non-education county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| employees where they're getting a raise, cities get two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| We're not getting anything and I answer those and respond to those inquiries as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| But thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| We may have another minute or two on your, let me ask you sort of an education, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| an aside question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I assume, I guess I can assume this because I know you're well-read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| You read Friday's Wall Street Journal editorial about Tennessee vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| Did you happen to read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| It singles out, it doesn't name names but it says the CEOs of Knoxville, Nashville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Chattanooga Chamber, it's involving the voucher issue before the legislature and it's Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| morning's Wall Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| The voucher, does that take half of the money out of your system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| If a voucher is in effect, does that take, the editorial infers it's half, the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| system believes it's half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| So if 10,000 per student, 5,000 goes to the voucher, I'm just looking at the numbers how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| There was a piece of legislation that was proposed that did exactly that, that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| have allowed for dollars to be used for private parochial schools that would take public dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1487)|
| 0:24:57| to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| And the way that the mechanism was written is that they would take 50% of the per-pupil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| expenditures and that would be the voucher, that would be the amount that would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| And I think our school board and myself, we sort of weighed in on that to say, just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| this, that that would really be moving in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| That everything that we have done in Tennessee the last several years has been about increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| accountability to make sure that we have great teachers in the classroom, to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| we have terrific instruction going on, to make sure that our kids are learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| And to take public resources and then allow those to be used in schools where there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| literally zero accountability is moving in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| And so, yes, the argument was made, well, if a student moves into, takes a voucher and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| moves into a private school, well, you still keep 50% of the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And really my response to that is, yes, that's okay, but it's really not just about the dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| it's also about the kids and making sure that our students are getting a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| And I'd have real concerns about, you know, where they were taking those dollars, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| they were spending those dollars and the lack of accountability that would be associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| with those dollars being spent in non-public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I'm in agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| I don't know if I'm an opponent or a proponent of vouchers and charters, which we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| but the numbers are half goes the opposite way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| So in theory, your system still gets half, but it loses other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Read the editorial and you'll know, I'm sure, talk in a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Commissioner Balls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1591)|

| 0:26:39| before we vote on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I wanted to, two things, one, Sam and I are going to meet, and this is a little off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| topic of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I'm on my way out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Sam McKenzie and I are going to meet Wednesday night at 7 at the Time Warp if anybody wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1615)|

| 0:27:05| education and I'm on my way to her graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1625)|

| 0:27:11| calls and the emails in the past week and I appreciate everyone coming today to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1631)|

| 0:28:03| come September of attending school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| I think I know where you're coming from and I support the budget as you all have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you, and again, thank you for being here today and I'm sure that we'll have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| more discussions before the budget is voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you for being here and good luck on your one o'clock event with the First Lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Next up, Sheriff Jones, Allison, anyone who wants to come forward, we'll spend a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| on the Sheriff's Department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| So if you could give us your name and address for the record, anything you would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| say about the budget, and then we'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| Allison Rogers, 729 East Bull Run Valley, High School, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| First thing we'd like to say is thank you all for funding the 65 vehicles in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| We're working on getting those out on the streets and hoping, knowing we'll realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| some savings in next year's maintenance budget for the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| We also want to thank the Mayor and his staff for the deletion of the negative allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| As you know, we have not seen a turnover that we have in years past at the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| So we were having a really hard time this year making up that negative allocation number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| of over $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Just a couple of highlights from our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Our overall budget has increased 1.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| That includes the deletion of the negative allocation account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| It includes the increase of health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| It includes some increases in the maintenance of the buildings out east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| They are 18 years old and it is costing money to keep them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| And I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| Commissioners, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| I was going to say, we can't let Allison not have a question, so Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Allison, we talked earlier, and I asked JJ, what does a step cost the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| It's around a million dollars, not including benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| So 1.3 maybe, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Yes, including benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| What percentage of raise is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| It's around a 4% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Oh, it's that big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| On average, it's 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Commissioner Chauce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| I just took my car through for the hail damage claim, whatever it was, and as far as it sees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| the value, I don't have an old car, but maybe I'll come out positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| But I just wondered, could you give us a snapshot of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| I read there was substantial damage to dozens or hundreds of cruisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| What are we going to do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| We are meeting with the FEMA representatives actually this week, this Wednesday, to go over the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| It looks like we're going to have about $225,000 in damages on our patrol vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| We're working with Alan Lawson at 9-1-1, and we're going to meet with the FEMA officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Hopefully we will receive a grant to cover those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| If we do not, it's going to have to come from our budget, which as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| we do not have the money to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| So that would just come out of your general fund, or therefore county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Allison, with regards to fuel costs, these things go up and down, up and down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| and I know that has a direct impact on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And when we have a situation where gasoline goes to $4 plus a gallon or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| and then it will drop back down, how do you figure those fuel costs on a yearly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| That is a major concern for us considering our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| We have budgeted retail costs of $3.45 for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| And, of course, as everyone knows, it's a lot more than $3.45 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| We've put the bid back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| It looks like it's going to be pilot again that we'll have the contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| You may see us back over here if gas prices continue to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| Do we pay retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| No, we pay retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| We have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| We pay retail minus the taxes, which is around at $0.40, minus the $0.05 discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| Or we do the cost plus ten, depending on which is the better pricing every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| And this may be a question for JJ, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| But in terms of next year, I know we've had a lot of discussions about your fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| and the aging of the fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| So what are we looking at right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| I'm not holding you to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| But in terms of next year's budget, are we looking at kind of fulfilling that original number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| or after you've thought about it, the number go up, down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So just kind of give me a general flavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| We originally asked for the 100 cars total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| And I think after the first allocation that you all approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| and this year's budget that we worked out with Dean and John Troyer, we're up to 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| We'll probably be asking for those 11 vehicles next year to make the 100 that we asked for to begin with this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| No more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Next is Dr. Martha Buchanan of the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2008)|
| 0:33:42| Any comments you'd like to make, Dr. Buchanan, then we'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Dr. Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Damard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I don't have a lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| The budget that you see before you for us is the budget that we turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| It's a budget that doesn't reduce services to the citizens but saves the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| And we're very happy and comfortable with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And I'd be happy to entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Talk to me a little bit about the Hardy Building and what your plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| At this time, what we're doing with the Hardy Building, Commissioner McKenzie, is we have moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| or are working on moving to more of a month-to-month relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| That was a lease that was a 10-year lease that bound us to that building for 10 more years if we signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| And we are still providing services there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| looking at trying to implement what's a community outreach worker model that has been successful in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| to bring folks in from the community, train them, and use that as a focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| and let them go out from there to work with citizens on diabetes management, hypertension management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| other types of medical issues that we know we have an issue in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| So we're looking at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| We're also looking at whether Cherokee wants to expand their primary care services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| They've applied for a federal grant to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| And that would put more primary care docs on the ground in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| and, again, just kind of make that kind of a medical hub for that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| continuing to provide the services that we provide with family planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and immunization services are continuing to be part of what we do there as well as STD screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| So that's kind of in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| But as far as the month-to-month, there's monies in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| To get us through this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| It's budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Dr. Buchanan, the high school community, or I'm sorry, the Daney community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| are you getting hours of that or is it same hours of operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Same hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Actually, I think we went back up on our hours of operation out there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| I've had several phone calls on that and people were hoping you would add some more hours back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Dr. Buchanan, could you explain to me the synergies that you have between Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| what Dr. Kim is doing in South Knoxville, and what the health department is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| or are there any synergies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Do they operate separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| I'm just kind of wondering if there's any kind of synergy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| They do operate mostly separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| How they operate together is that my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| and their staffs know the guidelines for each of the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| So if someone comes in and doesn't qualify for our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| they're probably going to qualify for Interfaith, so we're going to help them get over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Or say they're kind of in a transition, we can't get them in to get seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Dr. Kim's a great alternative, so we'll get them in over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| So they kind of work together at that ground level, meeting the needs of the folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| The nice thing about the way it's set up here in Knox County is it's kind of tiered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| So based on your income, you qualify for the different programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| so there's not a whole lot of overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| We could probably do that better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| but our staff really does a good job of getting folks where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Dr. Buchanan has met with the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| and so I'm sure has answered a number of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| but I know she's available for any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| So, Dr. Buchanan, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Next is the Dwight VanDeVate with the Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| if you would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| And your name and address of the record, any comments you'd like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and then we'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Dwight VanDeVate, 205 West Baxter Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| on behalf of the Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| We're actually in the unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and somewhat enviable position of having gotten a little bit more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| than we actually asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| We received an additional $300,000 in construction heavy maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| which is the budget from which we cover our paving costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| So we do anticipate that we'll be able to pave some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| or resurface some additional roadways in FY11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Other than that, everything that came back to us from the mayor's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| is consistent with what we submitted to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| So we obviously were very appreciative and very pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| and I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Question, with the closing of Solway, is that saving money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| How did that impact your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Well, it was a $72,000 revenue item that will actually come off of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| and $72,000 a year we were receiving in cost sharing from Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| But that will be more than offset by savings in staff time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| because a lot of staff time has gone into that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and also enabling us to concentrate on those eight county convenience centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| and promoting mixed metal recycling and other recycling at those convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| I don't want to prejudice the body, but that is an area that we need to really continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| where we've made great strides and we continue to need to make great strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| We have seen the metals market improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and we got a check for the month of April from PSC Metals for $56,000 for metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| that came into one of those eight county convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And again, that doesn't happen every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| and I'd like to even mention it because I don't want finance to move the revenue line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| But metals have been a commodity that has been really improving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| and the more that we can concentrate on those eight convenience centers and not on Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| the more we can promote things like metal recycling at those eight convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| It works two ways. It keeps it out of the garbage compactors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| It recycles it, which is revenue positive for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I think the closure of Solway is a non-factor for us from a fiscal standpoint or a budgetary standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| From a headache standpoint, frankly, it's fairly epic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| because an awful lot of staff time and attention has been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| in working through some of the issues that have been there over the last four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| One other question, then we'll get to the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| We had a very harsh winter, and that has created issues with our roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| potholes, et cetera. Is this budget going to be adequate to take care of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| because that's kind of out of our control in terms of what Mother Nature does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| and as we look forward to next year, if we have another harsh winter, salt, sand, the whole nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Do you feel this is going to be adequate to take care of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Oh, yes, sir. Again, we actually got back $290,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| and changed more in that construction heavy maintenance line than we requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Clearly, a couple things have changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| I wouldn't want to mislead you. As the price of gas goes up, so goes the price of asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| and the asphalt price index is higher than it has been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| and so even with more money, we aren't necessarily able to pave like we were seven, eight, nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| But the mayor's proposal significantly bumped up the dollar amount that's available for paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| and I think that we should be able to resurface more roads than we have in the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| Well, kudos to your staff. I know during the harsh weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| I think that your staff did a really good job as well as the state and the city in keeping our roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| so that our citizens can go out, and I know myself being able to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| and I just think they did a really good job on it, and I know it's costly to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| but it's very, very important that when we have these kinds of elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| that we're able to get back out on the roads as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Hey, Dwight. You talked about the closing Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Of course, that affects my district a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| but what are we doing to promote in this budget the use of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| we're going to have to meet that 25 percent criteria still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| and, you know, at my house, we've subscribed to Waste Management's recycling service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| and I know that Waste Connections also has home recycling service, one bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| I can't remember the single term for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| but what's the county going to do to try to promote that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| or, you know, the facility in Carnes will not facilitate any kind of recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| other than the metal recycling that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| and so the people in my area that tip their green waste there have to travel out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| what's the plans for, number one, promoting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| and number two, having more green waste places and metal recycling places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| for other residents that don't have that pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I think South Knox, is it South or East Knox County doesn't have a large, maybe Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| I don't know what Carter's facility is like, but it's nothing like the one at the other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Sure. If I might, Commissioner Anders, let me separate the pieces just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| and let's speak to the green waste issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| We actually are not going to wait on the upcoming budget year to go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| We have a bid that will be let in the next couple weeks to obtain a couple more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| actually I think a total of three more open top green waste compactors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| or general purpose compactors that will go to Dutchtown and to the Forks of the River Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| and then eventually we'd like to add a fourth center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| We're still trying to determine what the best location is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| but coming into the next fiscal year, we'd like to have open top green waste compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| at Halls, Dutchtown, and Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| so that everybody has some reasonable distance to travel where they can take small loads of organic green waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| the kind of stuff that they trim out of their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| and we're going to use the exact same model that we are using at Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| where a Goodwill attendant supervises the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Goodwill will collect a modest amount of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Really, I think for them, it's more a matter of having a place for one of their clients to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I don't think it generates any particularly meaningful revenue for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| but then if somebody can come in with a load of brush from their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| they can dump just that and leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| or if they've got their household garbage, they can go ahead and drop that off as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| Our goal is to close out next year with, we have eight convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| we would like to have a green waste option at four of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| so that we'd have one north, south, east, and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| and all commission districts would be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| As far as the other recyclables, we take mixed at a larger center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Your center at Carnes is our poorest performing center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| As you know, it's leased property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It's very small, and over time, we do look to replace that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| At a larger facility, such as Johnstown, Halls, Powell, Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| we're able to take mixed paper, steel and aluminum cans, plastics, glass, newsprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| and cardboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| We're trying to keep those things out of garbage compactors and in those recycling bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| One of the ways that we're doing that is we're starting to use graphic art materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| actually on the sides of the compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| to promote the introduction of the right stream into particular compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and to discourage the introduction of the wrong stream into the garbage compactors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| So we've got some plans like that that we're actually rolling out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| some this year, some next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| and we're going to continue to just work to promote recycling just from an economic standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| not an environmental standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Just from a pure matter of economics and fiscal conservatism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| we're going to continue to try to promote recycling at all eight of those centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| and we really would like, in the next year and a half or two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| to try to arrive at least at identifying a good location for a new Carnes Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| You've gone a long way toward answering what my, basically, it's a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| and I just wanted to get you to comment on the eight convenience centers that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Do you envision there are only two that really need significant footprint improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| You've got the other in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Carnes and Carter are far and away our weakest centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| We do not own the property under either one, fortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| and Carnes is a little bit more acute, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| because it has no queuing capacity for traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and when we back traffic up, we back it up onto Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| which is a really difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| So that's how it ended up being first on our priority list, but Carter is right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| And because you and I have had discussions about Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I have been by the other location, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| It's like Gibbs used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and if you can find a solution for the Carnes location like you've done for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| like has happened for Gibbs, we need to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Safety, convenience, lots of things, and then Carter can be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| But I just wanted to make sure that as you look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| those are the two that need to be worked on as far as the footprint goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Those are the two on our radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Kind of shifting gears a little here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| In terms of more capital type projects, what kind of roads are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| This is kind of in the same vein of what's on with the latest TIF that commission approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| Are we adding roads this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| We have a couple items, and Commissioner, as you know, I'm relatively new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| so forgive me, I'm going to refer back to my notes rather than try to call this up from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| We do have some capital projects that are moving, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| Dutchtown Road Phase 2, which is an extension of Dutchtown Road across Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| all the way on over to Park Village Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| We also are moving forward with the improvements for turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| and signalization at Level Road and Atlas Limited Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| and we're moving forward with realignment of Atlas Limited Drive and some widening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2861)|
| 0:47:50| Under discussion of late, the other major project that we've had under discussion of late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| has been whether or not it would make sense at this point to proceed with Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| of the Carnes Connector, which is an extension of Carnes Valley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| from where it terminates now at Dade Drive over to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| Those are sort of the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| We've got other smaller projects, signalization at Emory Road and Highway 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| Millartown Road and Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| We have signalization and lane improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| But in terms of just outright new road or major realignment, I think Atlas Limited Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| and the Dutchtown Road Phase 2 extension and possibly the Carnes Connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| would be the places where we might potentially be looking at laying new asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| So let's talk a little bit about the Atlas Limited Drive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| I guess I didn't, in terms of ranking, I'm trying to understand the driver for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| I'm trying to, I mean, because right now it looks to be, I mean, if that project moves on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| I'm trying to see the countywide benefit of that road, that connection, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2941)|
| 0:49:11| It's eventually going to connect with Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| There's property issues associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| I don't know if the community, if there's a big outcry from the community for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| I'm just trying to understand how that road got to be number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| I'm not actually sure I'd characterize it as number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| I think from our standpoint, from an engineering standpoint, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| I think the extension of Dutchtown Road, that second phase, would be our number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| As far as the realignment and extension of Atlas Limited Drive, really two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| The town of Farragut has expressed a lot of interest in seeing that west end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| where it terminates at Campbell Station Road and that area retooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| It's certainly been a problem for them and a little bit of a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Also, frankly, the potential for growth on that north side of the I-40, I-75 corridor is very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| So I believe that the mayor felt like it might be a good place to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| and make some preparations for hopefully a turnaround in the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| where we might see some more commercial developments, more business locations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Because certainly the south side, the park side, drive side, was and continues to be an unbridled success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| So how many dollars are we planning on putting in that in this year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| If I could, I'd like to come back to you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I think the overall project total is about $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| But how much of that would be spent this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| I'd be reluctant to say, get a chance to look at my notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| and I'll give you some idea of how many actual dollars we might spend this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| You know, and don't take this personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| And I know you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| But, you know, we heard in the budget presentation about, you know, what tough times we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| And we'll discuss that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| We've heard, you know, everyone has to tighten belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| and we've really got to, you know, really crank things down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| and eliminate a lot of really valuable programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| And to do this speculative project that, as I've dug into, doesn't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| I'm trying to see the immediate benefit, if that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| This budget is to get us through, just to eat by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| And we're talking about a really speculative project that, in an area, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| that has good development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| But this particular road has not been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| I don't want to venture to guess on the return of the initial investment there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| but there's not a lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| And here we are talking about spending $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| I mean, if we pull that project out, we could satisfy a lot of our other deficits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| I mean, you know, again, in this time of drastic draconian cuts that the mayor has laid before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:23| for us to be talking about a speculative project that really benefits a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| and I don't mean, I'm just sitting at East versus West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I'm talking about business from a business standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| I'm talking about, you know, a few folk, literally, and their business endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| I just don't see this at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| If we are truly at this crisis state that this budget is painted to be, for us to move on with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| I'm just trying to understand the logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| And I said number one, we had talked a little bit about, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| when we talked about the White Road Project, TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| we talked about what does the county engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| not the politicians or not the, you know, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| what does the county engineering department say are number one projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| or number one through three projects out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| I've not heard of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I've heard of it being talked about, but number one is us putting over $2 million in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| most of which, I don't know, I'd be interested to see when those funds are coming into your actual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| I'm just trying to understand the logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Let me jump in and mention a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I may not have done a good job really outlining the fact that there is transportation value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| particularly at the end of the project, both on the Campbell Station and the level road ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| There is significant transportation involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| We will move cars through faster and more efficiently certainly than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| There are also some alignment issues that will be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| So from a transportation standpoint, the project does bring value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| How much value and where it should fall is, I think, obviously a question open for debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| but it certainly is not without transportation value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| and it's not purely a project that's intended to, again, be speculative for purposes of eventual commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:33| I wouldn't want you to think so, and I'm sorry if my comments led you to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| I'm not sure that I've articulated the basis for it as well as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| I'd also make a point in terms of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| One of the things that we did find was that the Parkside Drive extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| which would be another project that at some point in time we would like to move forward on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| simply cannot be completed without condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| And so some of the funds that are slated for expenditure at Atlas Limited Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| are funds that have been sitting idle simply because we haven't been able to move forward on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| We think it would be not only procedures that would involve condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| but fairly lengthy legal battles, and I'm not certain that the timing is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| So these funds were obviously on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| They were not taken from another project that was viable at that particular point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| and so I don't think they were at the expense of work that otherwise was near term going to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| You know, again, I guess I'm trying to understand the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| And this has to be, you know, again, in these times, this has to be a value proposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| You know, as the gentleman said, the developer, I keep going back to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| I mean, he was, you know, envious of the level road traffic alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| He was, because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| It's a wide lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| I don't know how many lanes goes across I-40 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| But that road works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| That road, a lot of monies were spent to align those roads properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| So I guess I'm trying to understand, again, the logistics of traffic flow in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| So I'm just, hopefully you have a couple of questions, a couple of concerns that I'd like to have addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3381)|
| 0:56:31| You know, we can meet offline, but I'd still like to have those addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I don't have any comment other than the fact that I would like for you to pass on to your supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| and staff down the line my appreciation, I'm sure everybody else in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| is how fast that they got the roads cleared after the hailstorm a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| I mean, I know personally a couple of them who worked all night long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| and I'm sure that they weren't by themselves working all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| But I wish you would convey to them our thanks for a job well done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| I'd be glad to appreciate that greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Dwight, you all are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Are you all buying any new equipment this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| No, sir, we are not buying any new equipment this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| In a couple more years, we'll probably come back to the mayor, come back to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| and start to look to rotate out some of our dump trucks in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| But we're able to make do with the equipment that we've got at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| It's serviceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| And so given the financial constraints of the year, we thought that it was not a good time to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| Another point I wanted to talk, and it talks about Sam in some of your areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| and Dave in some of your areas where the two of you all come together over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| is at Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| I get asked so many times about that, going across where we can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| But that's pretty much in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Where does the county, how close is the county to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Are we right over the railroad track from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Is that where the county stops or starts right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| I mean, have we got together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| I mean, that would help three districts a lot to get that little bottleneck straightened out right there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| It's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| It is the city's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| But, boy, do I sympathize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| And in particular, you've got the railroad overpass, which-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| No, that's in the county's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| That's city from terminus to terminus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Another thing, you mentioned Manorville Highway and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| Were you meeting Manorville Highway and Norris Freeway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| We were wanting to change, put that red light where people could go north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| rather than have to go behind the old Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Is that still in the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| I think that's part of the Halls Connector project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| No, we're doing signalization at Manorville Highway and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| In fact, some of the equipment's already up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| You'll see that pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I've seen new poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| You'll have a quad box there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| You'll be able to actually see the signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| because when you are eastbound on Emery Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| and you're crossing Manorville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| a lot of times you lose your sight of the signal when you get to the stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Another thing that I've got, and this has sort of surprised me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| and, Dean, I want you to listen up, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| and, Martha, you're still here at the department, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Mr. Chairman, we passed a resolution over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| for the employee suggestion reward program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| And we've not had any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| We've not rewarded anybody for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And what I'm hearing, word hasn't got to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| You know, Dean, I'm not blaming you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| It's not your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| But department heads, we need our department heads to let,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| especially during this budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| if an employee has an idea, they can save Knox County some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| We're going to try that idea out for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| And if it works, then we're going to reward them 10% of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| And we've not rewarded anybody a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| And I just think it's not because they don't have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| but I don't think they've been notified, Mr. Chairman, that that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| And I think it makes everybody more of a team player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| If we could, Dean, if we could some way get that to department heads and let's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| because I know they've got some ideas out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| And, you know, Dwight, I would think in your department, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| that maybe that would be maybe the first area of some of the guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| But, I mean, I know you all run a tight ship now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| but if we can get that word out to the employees in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| this time next year, let the mayor present these checks to some of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| And I think once a couple of people start getting some checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| then other people are going to, and groups, because it was for employees and or groups of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| if you came up with an idea, we're going to bonus you 10% of that savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| I mean, that can be major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Any other questions for Mr. VandeVe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you so much, Dwight, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| And, of course, if we have any other questions, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| What we've done this morning is the schools, the sheriff, the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| and the Department of Public Works represents 89% of the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| So, my plan is next Monday, during the chairman's lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| we do not have a beer board meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| From 11.30 until about 1.30, 1.45, we'll have parks and recreation, some of these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| If you have any specific people you'd like to bring, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| But we'll go ahead and finish up some of these, as well as our elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| the constitutional offices, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| We'll have them come forward to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And then, during the course of our meeting, I'm anticipating a rather brief commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Of course, you never know how things work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| but perhaps have some time for public comment before our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| So, I'd be interested in your comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| and we're going to give these folks an opportunity to speak to us, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| But that's kind of my thought process, but I'd be interested in your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| So, your thoughts for, I guess, beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| What's the timeline for the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| When would you like for there to be a vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| Dean, if you'd like to come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| my understanding is that the mayor is going to call us into session June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| Is that still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| That is correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| June 13th will be the special call meeting for the sole purpose of voting on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Will that be in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Have you set a time for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| We have not set a time at the convenience of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| So, the mayor, and this is his right to do that, to call us into session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| and so we're looking at June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Is there a time the commission would like it set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| What day is that, Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| 13th is on what day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| On a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Is that a morning, better, or afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Is that a workshop day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| I prefer the afternoon, but that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Do we want to do 2 o'clock, or do we want to do an evening session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| 4 o'clock or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| I'm always voting for later, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| 9.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| How much time is he needing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| It depends on how much time we want to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| That makes one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| So, we're talking about meeting for lunch next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| That be it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I mean, we can do as many as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| That was kind of my plan was to bring in the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| If we need to have more discussions, we can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| But I wanted to do it in around the meetings that we already have scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| And we do not have a beer board, so that's going to give us about 2 1⁄2 hours next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| But we can meet above and beyond that whenever and wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| But the 13th would be the special meeting to vote specifically on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| That would be the only item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| 4 o'clock, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Okay, 4 o'clock, if you would delay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| We have a number of people who have signed up to speak to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| We want to give you the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| And so, what we'd like to ask you to do is if you could keep your comments to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| And we'll begin with Mr. Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| Is Mr. Roach here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Yes, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| On this June 13th meeting, will the community have an opportunity to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Yes, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria Avenue, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| I am a long-time resident of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| Of course, that's in the 6th Council District and Mr. McKenzie's Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| I am also a representative on the Neighborhood Advisory Council for the City of Knoxville, representing the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3873)|
| 1:04:42| I'm a co-founder of Friends of Williams Creek, which is a community watershed group in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| of which the Beck Cultural Exchange Center is situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| I am the son of two teachers within the Knoxville City School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3894)|
| 1:05:04| And I don't want to address the numbers that have been proposed for the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| That's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| But I want to talk about what those numbers represent and the relationships that come from that that are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| One of the things that my parents taught me was, and as I observed them in their careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| was that they established relationships between their students, between their co-workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| between the people who determined how they were to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| And there was a value put on those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Commissioner McKenzie spoke correctly when he mentioned value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| The Beck Center, the value within not just East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| not just within the African-American community in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| but within Knoxville and Knox County and East Tennessee, and indeed nationally, cannot be understated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3955)|
| 1:06:06| Its presence has been well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Its value has been well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| I would ask you all to consider, in this budget proposal for the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| is that you restore and reaffirm the value on the relationship that the Beck Cultural Exchange Center has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3980)|
| 1:06:33| first and foremost with Knoxville, next with Knox County, then East Tennessee, and indeed the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=3993)|
| 1:06:43| If I took something, almost 95 percent of something that you valued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| immediately away from you saying, I don't want to have that relationship in place any longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| so you go do what you need to do in order to make it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| you wouldn't think highly of what we had before, what type of relationship we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| So in your deliberations, in your considerations, again I would ask you to think in terms of the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| and the value that county commissions should put on its relationship with the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4034)|
| 1:07:25| It benefits organizations throughout Knoxville, Knox County, East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| That's been documented. That's well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| I guarantee you it will be brought out in further remarks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| So again, think in terms of relationship and the value that is being put on that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Diana Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| If you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| My name is Diana Kahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| I live at 704 Hickman Street in South Knoxville in Commissioner Mike Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| I attend St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| And I want to say something about the Beck Cultural Center, about a number of things that are cut in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| The Beck Cultural Center and Mobile Meals and Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| The Beck Cultural Center is a community center for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| And it's also a place for historical records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| It has very good historical records, local historical records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| These are two things that you'd think maybe government should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| South and West Knoxville have community centers that were built by government many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| and are operated by CAC today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| The Beck Cultural Center indeed is operated by, I guess, a private nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| but it certainly is a community center and it serves as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| My church uses it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Everybody else does in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| The second thing is Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| They've been cut significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| The former mayor fully funded Mobile Meals and made sure there was no waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| And I worry about senior citizens who are maybe going to go hungry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| because they need meals delivered to them and they're not going to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Legacy Parks is something I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| It's an integral part of the South Riverfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| It's cut entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| There are no funds at all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| I live in a riverfront neighborhood, and so I'm very interested in riverfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| And Legacy Parks, what they're doing is a big part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| It's going to fit in well with the apartment buildings that get built eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| My question is why the services that I as a taxpayer care about are being cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| There's not a shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| We're being told we've got to cut, cut, cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Oh, boy, this is an emergency budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| But we're not short of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Actually, collections have gone up in the last 13 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| So I'm wondering what are we going to spend the money on instead of the things that I care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| James Ware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| My name is James H. Ware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4243)|
| 1:10:52| I am the president of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4252)|
| 1:11:06| I live at 1750 Sayles Way in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4266)|
| 1:11:15| I thank you very much this morning for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4275)|
| 1:11:27| I address this meeting today both saddened and disappointed by the mayor's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| to slash Knox County funding for the Beck Cultural Exchange Center from $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4296)|
| 1:11:51| that we were funded this fiscal year to $12,000, a proposed $12,000 for fiscal year 12, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4311)|
| 1:12:08| Ladies and gentlemen, this is a 92% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:16| Ninety-two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| I think it's draconian, and I believe that it is unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4342)|
| 1:12:34| and that it will do irreparable damage in terms of our ability to deliver very unique services to the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4354)|
| 1:12:52| and Knox County communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| If you examine the proposed budget closely, you will notice that the funding for the Beck Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4377)|
| 1:13:07| comes from motel tax, which had a revenue this year that was increased to around $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4387)|
| 1:13:24| If you consider the $12,000 that is proposed toward the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4404)|
| 1:13:36| it's pretty obvious that that amount of money represents less than one percent of the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4416)|
| 1:13:48| from the hotel motel tax fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Actually, it's about one-third of one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| Now, these funds that we receive from the Knox County are directed toward an operating budget for the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:11| that totals around $350,000 to $400,000 per fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4451)|
| 1:14:23| So, Knox County is not providing total funding for the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| Knox County assistance is contributing to the operating cost to provide, again, the unique services that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4471)|
| 1:14:47| Beck Center makes available to the Knox community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Now, I want you to know that I am well aware of funding reductions that the mayor has proposed for other institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4493)|
| 1:15:03| And I have read several of the mayor's responses in the local media regarding these proposed cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4503)|
| 1:15:16| Further, I must say that I am somewhat surprised by the tone of these responses, some of which are barely civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4516)|
| 1:15:33| For example, the mayor's response to an article in the May 9, 2011 issue of the Halls Fountain, Halls slash Fountain City Shoppers Guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:56| which is a supplement to Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| The mayor's response responding to their questions relating to Beck Center funding cut is way out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4564)|
| 1:16:25| I believe that his response is potentially divisive in terms of our community and therefore grossly inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4585)|
| 1:16:43| First, the mayor has articulated a lack of respect for taxpaying African Americans, citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4603)|
| 1:16:59| And for the African Americans that visit our city and host large-scale events that enhance Knoxville's image as a final destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4619)|
| 1:17:16| and Knoxville's financial well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| Mr. Ware, if I could stop you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| His five minutes are up, but unless the commission objects, I want you to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| I'm going to give you some leeway to finish your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| I'll speed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Second, the mayor's proposal has summarily dismissed the value of the materials held by the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4654)|
| 1:17:45| Art, artifacts, literature, and thousands of historical documents that collectively create an archive that uniquely depicts the history of African Americans in Knoxville and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4665)|
| 1:18:05| The Beck Cultural Exchange Center holds items that are one-of-a-kind in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| What is most relevant is that these items are inextricably a portion of Tennessee history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4693)|
| 1:18:28| Now, I do not know the motivation for the mayor's sweeping devaluation of the historical and educational value of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4708)|
| 1:18:42| Perhaps his decision is based upon a lack of knowledge regarding the Beck Center, or perhaps something more sinister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| Regardless, I strongly urge the commission to reconsider the mayor's proposed cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4733)|
| 1:19:07| Ladies and gentlemen, the Beck Center is used by all age groups, races, creeds, and ethnic groups that comprise the Knox County population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:18| The center is used by a variety of Knox County organizations to hold meetings and special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| We are located within an easy walking distance of nine public housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| Dozens of children visit the Beck Center on a daily basis, and they use our computer bank, study space, and participate in special programs such as art classes, language classes, physical fitness sessions, and other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4773)|
| 1:19:55| Roughly 60,000 people per year visit the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4795)|
| 1:20:04| Over the past four or five years, I have believed that Knoxville is on the verge of becoming a city subject to close scrutiny and consideration for the location of major corporate activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4804)|

| 1:20:36| I believe that Knoxville was becoming a city that would be mentioned as one of the models for progress in conversations that always include Durham, North Carolina, and Charlotte in North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4836)|
| 1:20:58| as examples of what can be accomplished when citizens and local officials have the same goals and purpose and work together to pursue these goals in a unified manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4858)|
| 1:21:17| Ladies and gentlemen, it is simply a matter of priorities and a demonstrated appreciation for the rich diversity and history of the people of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4877)|
| 1:21:35| Again, thank you for the opportunity to address this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you, Mr. Ray. Let me ask a question, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| What time does the Beck Center open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Actually, there are personnel there at 8 a.m. in the morning, but they are there because they are dedicated, because they're not being paid until 11 a.m., and we usually close at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4909)|
| 1:22:10| But, again, you can come by there on any evening, and at 7, 30, or 8 o'clock, the lights will be on, and those folks, again, are there working off the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4930)|
| 1:22:23| The reason I ask is, if I were to come by Thursday morning at 8 a.m., could I have a conversation with you and perhaps some of your board about this issue, and I'd like to invite any commissioner that would like to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4943)|
| 1:22:36| I'll bring donuts, and so if that would be possible, I'd like to do that Thursday morning at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| That would be excellent, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| This Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| And, again, any commissioner that would like to come and join me, you're welcome to come, but I would like to come and sit down with these folks and have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| I want to recognize Dean Rice of the Mayor's Office, and then we're going to get back to those of you who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| I wanted to touch base just very briefly on the facts of the situation that led the mayor to the budget proposal that he has in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| and particularly referencing to the Beck Center, and he certainly appreciates the community and being here, and he appreciates the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| And Knox County taxpayers have provided about $3 million to the Beck Center since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| and that includes capital projects as well as operational, since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| The average amount of money given to Beck prior to 2004 was between $13,000 and $18,000 on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5012)|
| 1:23:41| going back to 1993 from the numbers that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| In 2004, the administration at the time entered into a memorandum of understanding with commission's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| and that memorandum of understanding said that Knox County would provide renovation funds as well as some operational funds through the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5031)|
| 1:24:00| And the other side of that was that the Beck Center would become part of Knox County property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| that the property would be deeded over, and that the operations of it would be assumed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| And the county then spent the money for the renovations and provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And in 2009, in August 2009, the past administration terminated that MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| and I can provide the commission with a letter of that, and stating that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| while they appreciated the work of the Beck Center and wanted to continue to find ways to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| that the memorandum of understanding had not been fulfilled in terms of the property being deeded over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| And so in the words of the letter, that was terminated to be effective in August of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| And so on August 15, 2010, during the last administration, that memorandum of understanding became no longer effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5088)|
| 1:24:56| And so those library funds, of which there would be $300,000 one year, $225,000 the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| and in the last 2010 it was, I think, $150,000, that funding stream was stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| because that mechanism, that vehicle for the fundings, the memorandum of understanding, was terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| And at that point, the Beck Center became in the same situation as the other historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| not in any way to say that Beck is simply a historic home, not in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| but to say that it began to work through the community grant process just like the other organizations do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| And so like other organizations, the Beck put forward its proposal to the community grants panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| That was viewed and the community grants panel recommended for 2012 that the funding be $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| That's the same level of funding as provided to Blunt Mansion, to Ramsey House, to Mabry-Hazen, and to other historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| And so that is the recommendation that was provided to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| and it is the recommendation that the mayor accepted and put the $12,000 into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| And so really we were in a situation where there was an agreement that $150,000 was under a memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| that commission approved in the last administration that was terminated in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| We're operating now outside of that memorandum of understanding because it was executed in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| And so that's where we are and that's how we came to that number of $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| But I just wanted to clarify that in terms of the facts in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Hey, Dean, before you go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| So in essence, under that memorandum of understanding, and I spoke briefly with John Troyer about it earlier this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| but in essence that memorandum of understanding would have made the Beck Cultural Center similar to the East Tennessee Historical Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| as a branch of the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| We would pay their employees and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Let me read, if I may, Mr. Chairman, just one paragraph here in that memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| This is on the resolution passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| It says, whereas under this agreement, ownership of the Beck property will be transferred to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| which shall conduct renovations and improvements upon it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| and operate it as an African-American cultural and history museum and archives for the benefit of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| That was the memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| In 2009, August 10th, in a letter addressed to Mr. A. Brown III, acting president, signed by then Mayor Mike Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5238)|
| 1:27:28| said that this letter is to provide official notification of Knox County's intent to voluntarily terminate the 2004 memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5248)|
| 1:27:36| And it goes on to say in the second paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| while Knox County is exercising its rights of voluntary termination under Section 4F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| the termination is primarily based upon the Beck Center's failure to transfer control of the Beck Center property to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| as provided for in Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Again, that is a previous administration's decision in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you. That clears me up a little bit. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| That's very interesting that you didn't know all that past history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| I just had a thought, and I know a little bit about preserving a little bit of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| but I wonder if the people from the Beck Cultural Center, have they thought about joining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| I mean, with the archives and things that they have, have you all thought about going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| and teaming up with the East Tennessee Historical Society and being a branch of them and joining forces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| I mean, it's sort of like what we're doing with the homeless thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| We've got different groups doing different things, homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| You know, we've got people preserving history here and we've got other people preserving history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Would it make sense to join forces with the East Tennessee Historical Society?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Any other comments to think about from the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| You know, it's not as simple, and I think Dean would agree, it's not as simple as the words that he's put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| And I understand we're being brief for time's sake, but in terms of the MOU, the MOU said a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5331)|
| 1:29:00| Okay, the MOU dealt with the Gateway Center, which is right there next to Ruth Chris, which is now part of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| The MOU said a lot of things that I think both sides, you know, either weren't very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| and all this was before most of us were sitting on this body, that both sides maybe not were aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| or maybe not were quick to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| So I do think picking out a couple of those and saying this is why we're where we are now is a little too abrupt of a conclusion to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5365)|
| 1:29:37| I think that there was an iterative process, which I was a part of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| toward the end of my three years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| There's a lot that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| And I think we need to put this whole thing in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| And as you heard Mr. Ware say, it's more than a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And I'm not saying that that's what you said, Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| But the Beck Center is more than a senior citizen center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| It's more than a youth center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| But the seniors come and the youth come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| The folks in the prime of their life live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| I was at Beck three times last week past 7 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| And there were staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| I'm sure they were not being compensated for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| So, you know, it's also, as has been alluded to, you know, it's part of what makes us East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| And, you know, we kind of confuse things when we talk about operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Then we talk about hotel, motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Look, leave this meeting, go down to the corner of Summer Hill and Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| pick up any of the pamphlets and the paraphernalia that talks about what makes us uniquely East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| You'll see a picture of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Or you'll see the Kumba dancers dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Or you'll see a picture of Haley Square that was brought here through the same folks that bring the Kumba Festival here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5456)|
| 1:31:05| So, and that's all you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| So if we're to be a community that we are, that we've always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| You know, we talk about this being the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| We've always been a community that embraces all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| We didn't have the race relations issues that the Memphis' and the Atlanta's and the Nashville's had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| because we understood certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| We hired policemen early on for certain basic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| And if you look at it from a tourism standpoint, if we're saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| Beck has gone from, regardless of how far we got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| gone from over $400,000 a year in operating down to $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| Beck's made the sacrifices understanding that, okay, this MOU did not, both sides for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5516)|
| 1:32:04| was not the best fit for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| But I'd also say in 2004, there's a beautiful library out there at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| Beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| Senior citizen centers in South Knoxville and in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| All those things came during that same time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| You know, there was an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| There was a promise made to the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| And again, and I don't want to get too far into this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| but we have a library in Holston Hills that we still call in Center City Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| But part of that, part of that agreement, and folks took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Folks, okay, you're going to move the library out to Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| I live in Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| You're going to move it out there, but we have Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| We have this entity that you can't quite put your finger on, but it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| It works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| It's efficient use of tourism dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| Of tourism dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Of what we're saying we're about when we're advertising ourselves to the entities that are coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| That's what Beck is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| It's about the complete life of being an East Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| It's saying I value the University of Tennessee and Saturdays at Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| I value country music and its roots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Its deep roots here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| But I also value the struggle that is uniquely American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| That is uniquely East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| $150,000 is a drop in the bucket on what it takes to operate a facility like Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| It's a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| So, you know, I thank the chair for going over to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5638)|
| 1:34:08| And I encourage each person, and I'm not meaning this in any way, but this is the first meeting that I've been to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| where I've been in the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| So I thank you all for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| For three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| So I encourage you to come out to Beck and see what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| Look at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Look at what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| The county has stood behind Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| And that's what I don't want to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| And this whole thing, I don't want to lose the fact that the county has stepped up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| Beck, we embrace what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| We embrace what you're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| We're going to help you build these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| So we built this thing, and now we're hands off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| This is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| This is one of the toughest things that I've had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| And my wife is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| She'll tell you, sleepless nights over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| So I just, you know, encourage you all to go there, to listen, to listen to everything that's said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| Some things may be a little tough for the ears to take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| But listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Bring it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| And hopefully we'll be able to understand that the entities like Beck and like the Kumba Festival are what makes us Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5715)|
| 1:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Commissioner, I would only submit that the mechanism, the vehicle to which that funding was provided to the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5734)|
| 1:35:42| was terminated by the previous administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| It stopped on August 10th of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| Well, again, and I'd ask you if you would make that letter available to Jolie or someone like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| because it also said that we will continue, Mayor Ragsdale will continue to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| The MOU is one thing, but the letter also said that we will continue to support and we stand behind Beck as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| So again, there's some vagueness in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| And for a budget to go from over $400,000 to $150,000 talks about that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Cheryl Rollins, or sir, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| Yes, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Just a quick point is that Dean Rice, my name is Avon Rollins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| I'm the Executive Director and CEO of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| I live at 1407 Roslyn in Knox County in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| In the second paragraph he read, it said that Beck violated the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| Very briefly, our attorneys drafted a lease agreement to transfer the property to the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| That was done by Arnold Korn and Mark Siegel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| We delivered it to the mayor and the law department of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| They never did act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| If anybody violated the agreement, it was Knox County, not the Beck Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5832)|
| 1:37:23| Again, and Commissioner Smith, I do appreciate what you said with this new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5843)|
| 1:37:31| Let's dig into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| If we want to dig into the actual MOU, we can dig into that really, really deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| And I'll tell you, it will make your head hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| And at the end of the day, you'll say, okay, there was some shared responsibility in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| And that's what I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Hopefully we won't have to dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| But let's look at it from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| I think both sides have said, okay, the MOU may not be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Having county employees work at Beck may not be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Having PBA take care of Beck may not be the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| There was a lot to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| But at the same time, and I think that's what the heart of the mayor's letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| is this MOU may not be the best thing for Beck or for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| but support of Beck is something that the county wants to do and wants to do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5898)|
| 1:38:26| Cheryl Rollins, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| My name is Cheryl Rollins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I live at 1407 Roslyn Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| And I am the president of the Knoxville branch of the NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| And right now I had my words repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| but I am upset and outraged at what I have seen taking place just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5931)|
| 1:39:02| When I was asked to speak before this august body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| I was sure that I wouldn't have any problems because I had so much to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| on the subject of the Beck Center and the loss of its funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| After sitting at my computer for nearly two hours and the page was still blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| I asked myself, how do you speak to the unspeakable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| when your disappointment strikes you numb with grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| I was simply filled with too many words to condense in a five-minute remark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| what the loss of the Beck Center will mean to this community and to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5983)|
| 1:39:52| You may well ask, why is Beck so important to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| It's very hard to express the feelings in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| the outrage, the disbelief, the desolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| and feelings of betrayal and abandonment that have been expressed to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| And I needed to do this for my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| and still not be accused of playing the race card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| Because that is the last thing I am here for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| I am here to speak of humanity and where Knox County is going to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6033)|
| 1:40:42| I find the statement about the race card to be very offensive to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| because we, as African Americans in this community, we don't have to play at anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| The facts of our differences are self-evident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| And in my liberal world, I had begun to believe that Knox County had begun moving forward into a new day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| where we could come together without the issue of class and race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| Right now, after hearing those remarks, I'm not too sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| As the NAACP president, I have gone out of my way, as have members of our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6083)|
| 1:41:32| to ensure that we do not act with an illusion of inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| We believe we have as much right as anybody else to be rightful members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| and to live and be considered full partners in this multicolored mosaic known as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6107)|
| 1:41:58| I'm here today because a great many of my citizens, my friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6118)|
| 1:42:05| are feeling discouraged and consider the ramifications of the present budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| as something that does indeed have racial overtones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| I feel many things, but that is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| As I have talked with a white friend of mine who is a conservative Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| he said, Cheryl, it's not about race, it's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| It's just morally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And this budget is wrong on so many levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| I have heard someone speak today about having $300,000, maybe I misunderstood, of excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6162)|
| 1:42:51| And the only organization that receives county funds to be cut by 92 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6171)|
| 1:43:01| was the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| We need to answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| We need to explain that to the people in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| So they do not feel that the burden of the budget crisis is being borne on the backs of the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| the disabled, the old, the disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| those who can least afford to have support taken from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| I believe there is a disconnect in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| just as there is a major disconnect in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| We are a nation going broke while we're giving billions to our enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| Floods have ravaged one half of the country, and fires, earthquakes, and tornadoes the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6225)|
| 1:43:53| These are very terrifying days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| But we must all pull together and not be divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| We know there are budgetary problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| but is this funding matter going to split this town apart on a far greater scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6247)|
| 1:44:16| and erase all the goodwill black and whites working together have tried to promote and sustain in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6256)|
| 1:44:27| Beck Center was cut one-third of its budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| And now there is a proposed 92% cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| As I said, the largest cut of any other entity in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| There is a disconnect here when we treat Beck as if it is just another antique house, a restored home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6285)|
| 1:44:56| There are those who do not know nor can they understand what Beck means to us in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| It has been said that Beck is taking the taxpayers' dollars as if we members of the East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6305)|
| 1:45:18| were not taxpayers ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| The unspoken message being said is you don't deserve taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6322)|
| 1:45:36| Yes, Knox County did rise initially to offer the equality of expenditures during the previous administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6336)|
| 1:45:46| but look at us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| Why is it in the year 2011 that we still see that there are some who feel we are undeserving of any part of the American dream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6349)|
| 1:46:00| We are property owners and taxpayers, soldiers and teachers, doctors and lawyers, ministers and educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6360)|
| 1:46:11| We encompass everything in our community that you want encompassed in yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6371)|
| 1:46:22| We ask that there is no other entity that has received funding that can be reduced by 92% and stay viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6382)|
| 1:46:39| There are other museums in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| There are other libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| There are other senior citizen centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| They have received large funds from Knox County to be built, to grow and to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6406)|
| 1:46:54| Why is it then when that happens in our community all of a sudden there is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| and we are to deed away a historic part of our community in terms to get some of our own taxpayer dollars back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6421)|
| 1:47:16| The tragedy that is Knox County is we're only talking about the past four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6436)|
| 1:47:24| If this community really wanted to be upset, look at what Knox County did in terms of actual dollars for this community during the past 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6444)|
| 1:47:36| So when you look at it, we haven't been given anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| If anything, we have been shortchanged when it comes to what we receive in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6460)|
| 1:47:51| On this occasion here today, I present the proposition to you that you must look within yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| and decide what county you want Knox County to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I was the first to call on our youth to stay away from the Klan and the Nazi Party when they visited Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6485)|
| 1:48:15| The NAACP wants no youth to be hurt by the forces that seek to tear this great nation apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| But yet I am perplexed and confounded as to why the city, state, county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6502)|
| 1:48:32| and the federal government gave back funds to invest to hundreds and thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| only to see the lights turned off and the structure gutted over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| This is a misuse. This is the misuse of taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6528)|
| 1:48:56| Beck is not only a world-class museum, but it assists in educating future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| The Beck Center is a building that is more than a building, but it is a gathering place for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| It is a safe place for decent young people trying to get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| It is a place where they have access to computers when every other place is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| Beck gives Knoxville the type of image that brings business and industry to a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| Beck is an integral part of the environment that says East Knox County, East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6571)|
| 1:49:40| Knoxville is ready to take its rightful place in the state and become a place where industry, families and children thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6580)|
| 1:49:52| In the past we have had a county government where bickering between the different factions of the community reached national news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6592)|
| 1:50:01| It was a joke on the evening news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| The NAACP is 103 years old and we still seek today what we sought in the beginning, opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6605)|
| 1:50:15| To close Beck Center is to take away the hope of opportunity from our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| The NAACP has great hope for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| The same day that I found out about this budget crisis, the 92% reduction in funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6627)|
| 1:50:35| I had just asked for support to give refurbished computers to the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| so that the NAACP and Beck could work together to keep youth in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| You must have knowledge of computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| You've heard Dr. McIntyre speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| He has spoken to the community, elected officials at Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| I am sick and tired of seeing my tax dollars going to pay for the prison pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6662)|
| 1:51:11| because both you and I know that when these young people get behind and drop out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6671)|
| 1:51:18| then they are going to become victims of the streets of urban America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6678)|
| 1:51:24| Do you want them to lose hope of any possibility of a life where they will become a part of the American dream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| because they will become a statistic of the criminal underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| Beck is part of the people and the ideas and the ideals that are striving to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6699)|
| 1:51:51| We are spending five times what it would take to house a prisoner than to give back $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6711)|
| 1:52:07| This is the insanity and this is what must stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| Beck Center fulfills many roles to many people from all races and from a cross section of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6733)|
| 1:52:23| Do not deprive them of the opportunity that is Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| In closing, I want to thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| I want to ask you to not vote in favor of the 92% cut made to Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6754)|
| 1:52:44| Not only has too much been invested in it to see it close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| but why would you want to send a message to the African American community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6770)|
| 1:52:58| and to the community at large that an African American cultural museum is not worthy of survival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6778)|
| 1:53:08| I say to you today, Beck is worthy of survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| Let us meet, let us discuss, let us compromise, let us do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6794)|
| 1:53:24| than just sit here and let Knox County go back to the way things used to be 50 or 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6804)|
| 1:53:34| We deserve better. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6814)|
| 1:53:42| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| We have another 13 people who have signed up to speak and we want to give you the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| But I feel the need for us to take about a five minute break if that would be appropriate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| So we will come back here at approximately 2 o'clock. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| Once again, thank you ladies and gentlemen for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| We are scheduled to begin our workshop at 2 o'clock, but we do have some other individuals that are wanting to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| and we want to give you the opportunity to do that. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| I would like to, well, one, thank the Chairman for allowing us to go past our start time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6854)|
| 1:54:23| for the good of the public and the fact that we have people here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| So thank you, Mr. Chair, for allowing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| With that said, we really need to keep our remarks to the five minute timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| You know, there are people here that are scheduled to be here at 2 o'clock for our general work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| So if you all want mine to keep your minutes to the five minutes, I think it will be best for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6886)|
| 1:54:56| So let's, is it Anthony Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Mr. Brown, if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| Good afternoon. My name is Anthony Brown. I live at 2629 Sunset Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| First of all, I wanted to say that my family came here in 1791, the same year Knoxville became a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6910)|
| 1:55:18| And I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| And it's very important to me in all aspects that we do well with more jobs, that we keep the streets safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| But it's also important about the Beck's Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| It is a very, very unique place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| It is much more than a historic house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| It is much more than a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| Kids from everywhere, Jonesboro, Washington County, Granger County, they come here all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| My nephews go to school right over here by KC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| They've been there three times every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| And people love to come see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| And like we said earlier, it's a special tourist item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| And when these people come here from out of town, they stay at the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| They spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| They're banking that tax money that we're using to spend on these special funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| It's very, very important. It's very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| Now in the budget, it was said that he cut 34%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| I was watching the program yesterday morning on TDW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| 34%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| For Beck's Cultural Center, it was 92%. It's nowhere close to 34%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| And then he said, this morning I was told on another TV program that they were only $12,000 was given to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| Well, Museum of Art has 28.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| The Opera has 28.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| Hall of Fame, I've never seen more than four cars there at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| That got $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| Now, I know that the African Americans make up about 12% of the population of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7001)|
| 1:56:49| But this is more than just our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| This is all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| All the kids come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| It has to do with everybody knowing each other better, getting along, knowing each other's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| And just like the STEM schools, it's something that will make Knoxville hopefully better in the next generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| People love this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| It's done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| People come there to have weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| They have birthday parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| They have anniversaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| They come there for business meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| They come there all the time for many different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Dinner parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| It's a great place with lots and lots of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I hope when you go there Thursday morning, you'll spend a little time and watch some of the stuff that's on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| There's a really, really deep sense of history in that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| The other thing I wanted to say was it's also educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| And the money for the tax fund, like he said, if you got 1% of that money, it would be way more than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7055)|
| 1:57:47| It would be way more than $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| I don't know what would have to be done to rework the numbers, but we implore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| Please find a way to put that money back into Bex Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| It's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7081)|

| 1:58:28| I was very upset when I heard about the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| I didn't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| I truly don't understand it still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| And I think it will take a long time for me to try to understand the concept of or the motion to cut funding in such a drastic measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7120)|
| 1:58:51| Elizascape.org utilizes Bex Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| We work with males 9 to 19 years of age to try to keep them from being idle and falling to the juvenile justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7134)|
| 1:59:03| The Bex Cultural Center doesn't ask for extra money for our young men to come in there to use the computers, to learn Japanese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7143)|
| 1:59:11| to learn conflict resolution so they won't fall into the juvenile system or the prison system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| They don't ask me for extra handouts or anything of the such to help our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7159)|

| 1:59:32| One of the things that I found in regards to the administrative goals of our government of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7172)|
| 1:59:41| it was to build stronger and safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| A lot of the young men that I work with, they have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| They don't have transportation to go to Burlington Library or get downtown sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| They can walk to the Bex Cultural Center and know that they have a safe haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| They have a way out of their present circumstances or things of the such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| Cutting funding from the Bex Cultural Center will cause a great catastrophe in regards to the juvenile system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7204)|
| 2:00:13| in regards to the crime rates skyrocketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| If anybody in this government believes or council believes that this will help funds to be saved, it will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| It will cause you to spend more funds in regards to prison systems and juvenile systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| and things that will cause our communities to fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| I was listening to a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| The ramifications are greater than what I have time to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| But it seems to me personally, my personal opinion, it was a targeting of African American historical sites and events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7244)|
| 2:00:53| We rarely have them here in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| The Kumba Festival and the Bex Center is what I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| The Kumba Festival generates funds through all the things that they present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| The Bex Cultural Center releases understanding and education of where we come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| what our history is about in regards to Knox County and throughout the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| A lot of African American children that I work with, a lot of children, period, that I work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| know nothing until they reach the Bex Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| And that should not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| That should not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| But the Bex Cultural Center has stood up and literally gave them a chance to understand who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| to build their self-esteem, to encourage them to go forth beyond what people expect them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| So literally, this should not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| Community involvement, education, recreation, all is consistent with the Bex Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7309)|
| 2:01:57| Education, recreation, youth and community involvement are a part of the Bex Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7317)|
| 2:02:08| So once again, I urge you to reconsider this cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| this drastic cut for the Bex Cultural Center and the Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7339)|

| 2:02:33| I reside at 4618 Millard Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| First of all, I want to thank the commission for giving us the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| Myself, I consider it a peculiar privilege and exercising of the rights of a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7364)|
| 2:02:53| We understand the times that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| No one, no entity, no municipality is immune to what is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7379)|
| 2:03:08| unprecedented as being a student of history in quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| You've heard of all the benefits from the Bex Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| and all of the great opportunities it presents to all young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| And I'm not going to belabor or extend the time by rehashing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| I do want to speak to you on behalf of a new transplant to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| Being a Methodist minister, having been transferred from Charlotte, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| some of my first impressions of this community, I was quite impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| My family and I came in during the winter of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| We were able to go out to Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| and we were just quite impressed, overwhelmed by the cordiality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| and the hospitable nature of what we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| We saw the skaters, and we met people from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| It just made me feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| I felt good about becoming a citizen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| And then I was introduced to the Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| and I thought to myself, I haven't had some very experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| I was blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| I don't mind sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| I was born to a mother, a teenage mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| and it was education that helped me to move beyond my circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| of growing up in rural Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| I was able to go to Wake Forest University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| receive a master's degree from North Theological Seminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| And of all the places I have lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| I was quite impressed with what I saw in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| I was able to go to the Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| and I saw the value that was placed by this community on diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| on lifting up all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| because in actuality we are each other's keeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| We work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| None of us work in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| We are here to be a part of the great tapestry that is known as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| Like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| I understand the great challenges facing this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| this board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| And I just would have you to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| as Knoxville and Knox County ventures to this place of being a world-class city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| and a world-class community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| we can't leave anybody behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| We must be united as we go forth facing the challenges that are to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| I am proud to be a citizen of Knox County and of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| but I want you to know that my first impression of this city was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| it was even on a greater plane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| moving to a greater place than even Charlotte, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| with all of its accolades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| And I believe that Knoxville has great days to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| However, the great tenet of our democracy compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| if it is not exercised in this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| we will find ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| the history books will record what happened with this fiscal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| Those who are to come after us will look at us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| we did not truly live out the creed of what it means to be an American citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| The creed of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| that we come together and compromise and do what is best for the total good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| I understand that the mayor had challenges to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| but it seems to me that we've heard from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| we've heard from the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| why can't we sit down together and work out and compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| as the chair has stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| I was pleased to hear that, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| and I pray that as you meet together you consider what is best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| not only for the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| but all the other entities that are involved in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| I just believe as a newcomer that Knoxville has great days to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| but the great days are going to be contingent upon our ability to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| for the greater good of everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| We believe that the Beck Center is a tremendous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| tremendous resource in the East Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| as has been stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| not just East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| but the entire city, county, state, and nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| I implore you to use, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| that great tenet of our democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| compromise and to reconsider the proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| so that the Beck Center continues to be a beacon of light in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| and we might continue to move forward to be the best city in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| if not the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| Next we have, and as I'm getting older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| my eyes are not what they used to be, but Cato,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| and I can't make up these, pardon, Clowney, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| If you would give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| Cato Clowney, 1919 Smoky View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| People, today we come together, I hope, in unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| Let me go back for a few seconds and to emphasize what happened to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7667)|
| 2:07:54| is happening to the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| In 1962, I played in the Old Negro League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| You know what they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| They cut our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| They made it impossible to play in stadiums that cut our funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| so we had no operational money to keep on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Every person here that has made a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| starting with our president and the president of our NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| and don't forget frat brother McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Let us think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| Let me give you a couple of incidents why cutting hurt young black people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7712)|
| 2:08:38| and young white people, the middle class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| At a parade a couple years ago, again, this is based on cutting the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7723)|
| 2:08:52| There were a parade, and the parade, as it came along the street, it was in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7732)|
| 2:09:00| there were a little young man on his father's shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| and the young man, as they played this song, God Bless America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| the young man made the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| He was about six or seven years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| He tapped his father on the shoulder and said, Dad, when will I become American?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7754)|
| 2:09:23| His father was in shock because I was standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| His father made the statement, You are American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| The little boy made the statement, Not in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| This is all because of cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| As President Ware stated, the Beck Center is the key to growth in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| If we cut, we increase the cry of a young black American or a young white American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7784)|
| 2:09:54| For every cut you make, you increase the hatred that these young Americans have in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7794)|
| 2:10:04| They don't trust us. They don't believe in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| So we must gain their trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Another instance, a little boy, nine years old, was involved in a fight at his school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7810)|
| 2:10:19| Three or more kids jumped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| And when he went home, he made a statement to his parents, Why do they hate me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| God said, Love each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| When we hear kids say that, and when we hear our young people make the statement, When will I count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| Am I part of America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Most of our young people today, when you ask the average young American, black, white, whatever nationality he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7842)|
| 2:10:50| and ask him, How does he feel about being American?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| People, they can't tell you because they are confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| So by cutting the budget on people within the Knoxville area and especially the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| which is an outstanding and a great place because we have people here today that work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| that give their free time and their love and their care for the young people of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7873)|
| 2:11:20| People, if we care, you as city representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7880)|
| 2:11:27| if you love our youth today, give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| Now if you cut the budget at the Beck Center, which is an outstanding and great leadership place for young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7891)|
| 2:11:39| you cut the lives and you shorten the stay and you shorten the love that these young people can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7899)|
| 2:11:48| Have any of you been in a place where kids that need love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| and they come up to you and they put their arms around you and they look up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| and I've seen it happen to our president here, Avon Rollins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| A young man came up to him and put his arm around him and looked up to him and said, Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| Take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| If you cut, you take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| You take away the love because when those kids leave the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| their little eyes are glowing and shining because they have someone there that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7936)|
| 2:12:23| Their care is to love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| Love is to give and forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| Forget about the budget that the mayor, it's so idiotic that you would take away from the young people of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7948)|
| 2:12:37| because we all are American, but we have to teach our young American people by keeping the Beck Center that we care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7957)|
| 2:12:46| People here today, commissioners and everybody here in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| as the old saying, I give a damn, you give a damn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| and let this budget come back, the money that Becks do come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| Andre Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| Andre Canty, 5925 Lois Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| When you look at it on paper, it kind of says Lois Lane to Superman's girlfriend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| And I have an iPhone and I have a time limit on myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| I won't keep a time limit on myself because I'm shy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| I don't speak too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| But I'm assistant director at the Beck Culture Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| And to my left and to your right is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| In the middle is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| On the eastern part of that picture in Knoxville is an institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| It's been around since 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I'm 26 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| I'm probably the youngest person in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| I'm a product of black history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| And now in my part of black history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| everybody in this room has been greatly affected by black history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| And also I stand before you as what many people consider as public enemy number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| I'm a black American male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| I'm young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| I'm supposed to be on Just Busting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| I'm supposed to be in jail right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| But if I didn't know my history and my legacy, then I would probably be just another statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| You would probably be seeing me in those Just Bustings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| I wouldn't be standing here before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| But I'm standing before you because I know about my history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| If I didn't know that, Lord knows what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| Many of you probably not have known me, but your kids know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| I've been to your schools, your churches, your youth prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| I spoke about motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| It don't matter where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| Like I said, I went to the most grommiest prisons to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| I speak to whoever needs to be spoken to because these kids need a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| And if I'm that voice, be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| Because Mr. Ware and Mr. McKenzie mentioned that sometimes we open the Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| and the Beck is open past 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| Most of the time, my behind is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| I have a pillow in my office just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| After 6, I will take a nap and get back to work because I'm dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| But again, this is more than a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| This is more just pictures and newspapers, exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| It's for the whole community, Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| In fact, what happens here affects the entire world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| We're a global society now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| So what happens here and what don't happen here can affect everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| Everybody that's standing before me, everybody that's standing behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| Behind me is the impact that the Beck Cultural Exchange Center has had on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| It's not just black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| It's not just white, young, old, female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| And I stand before you as a product of not only that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| but a product of a generation who don't know their history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| If I'm the only one standing here to disprove that, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| But I'm standing before you as probably the shining hope of not only each Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| but Generation Y and the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| I'm the future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Maybe I will sit in one of your seats one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| But if I don't know my history and if I go somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| then what's going to happen to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| Because I'm trying to sit you all down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| And I'm trying to put the seat out to let you all sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| but you need to give us a little leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| Help me pull that chair out for you so I can basically take your light and your torch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| and keep it running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| But we have to keep the Vet Culture and Safety Center running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Renee Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| Can you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| My name is Joshua Ooty, O-U-T-S-U-Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| I live at 310 Watauga Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| I basically just want to ask you, please, do all you can to help keep the Vet Center running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8224)|
| 2:17:15| Like, I need the Vet Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| The future generation of young citizens here in Knoxville need to know our heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| I'm originally from Birmingham, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| And in living there, I was taught that I could be a great person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8250)|
| 2:17:40| because we have in Birmingham a facility called the Civil Rights Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8260)|
| 2:17:46| Now, the Vet Cultural Center is the closest thing that we have to that institute here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| What would it be like without that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| Young people in Knoxville need to know that they can be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| I am a social justice coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| I'm a community organizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| I'm also 25 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| Community organizers from Knoxville are the ones who run the Vet Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| How can I learn to be like these people if I have no opportunity to speak to these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| to go to their place of business, to look in the books that are on the shelves and learn about the history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| It needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| So whatever you can do to support that, I need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8315)|

| 2:18:48| Is that correct, Sharon Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| No, it's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8330)|

| 2:19:06| I'm appearing before you all, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission, staff and community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8346)|
| 2:19:15| as co-chair with the special agent in charge of the FBI, Richard Lambert of the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8355)|
| 2:19:28| The Vet Cultural Exchange Center is a very valuable community resource for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8368)|
| 2:19:35| The proposed funding slash from $150,000 in fiscal 2011 to $12,000 in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8375)|
| 2:19:47| drastically jeopardizes the Vet Cultural Center's ability to serve Knox County as it currently does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8387)|
| 2:19:55| These funds are generated by hotel-motel tax, which generates almost $5.5 million in the last 2010 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8395)|
| 2:20:06| One of the functions of the Vet Center serves as the meeting place of the East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8406)|
| 2:20:14| which was established in 1996 as the Knoxville Hate Crimes Working Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8414)|
| 2:20:21| The East Tennessee Civil Rights Working Group is a networking organization of community leaders, civil rights advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8421)|

| 2:24:47| I would like to first thank you all for giving me an opportunity to come before you and speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| I am the owner-operator of Optasia Productions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| For those that do not know me, Optasia Productions has produced more than 50 stage productions in this area since 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8697)|
| 2:25:07| and we have also produced independent films, commercials, sound recordings, all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| I stand here today to represent artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| The Back Cultural Exchange Center has been a place that not only the artist of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| has been able to go there to not only meet, to discuss, to plan, to rehearse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| and then also now, with the addition, to display what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| Not only performing artists, visual artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| The Back Cultural Exchange Center has been a very important place because, as you know, the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| when it comes to slashing budgets, we're usually first on the agenda to get slashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| But where are we to go if we are to present something of quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Where are we to go to enhance it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| Where are we to go to rehearse it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Where are we to go to more or less get it ready for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| What would the world be without art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| What would the world be without music?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| Without a movie to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Without watching someone dance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| Without watching stage productions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| But we are always the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| Now, in relation to the Back Cultural Exchange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| they have opened their doors to your local artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8790)|
| 2:26:35| As a result of the Back Cultural Exchange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| artists from this area have gone on to New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| have gone on to Los Angeles, have gone on overseas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| have really done great things in the area of developing their art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8805)|
| 2:26:50| so that they can present something on a worldwide as well as national basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| that you, citizens of Knoxville, can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| Yes, we can go to churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| but we're presenting Annie and Cinderella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| That would be good, but what if we want to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| That's a little warehouse in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| The churches may not be that apt to allow us to come in to rehearse something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| But yet, it is art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| And it is something that is necessary for each and every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| so they have the opportunity to behold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| I stand before you because I, as an artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| have been able to go to the administration of the Back Cultural Exchange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| on many an occasion to ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| would you help us, would you allow us to come in and meet and prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| and write and develop and rehearse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| and, yes, in some cases display what it is that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| Please consider helping to keep this budget intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| because, once again, it will be something that will cut your artists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| and then we will not have that opportunity to put inside of those persons what's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8884)|
| 2:28:09| so that they can come back like the David Keiths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| And the Phil Kozaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| And the Palmer Williamses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| And accept the key to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| And become Grand Marshals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| And someone that you can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| Please consider keeping this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8906)|

| 2:28:43| Margaret Gaither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8923)|
| 2:28:59| Thank you for allowing me this moment to say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| I don't need to repeat everything that has been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| but I must say to you that I believe that you are proud of Back Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| I have been with it since its opening in 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| And I'm not a young girl anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| but I have found that it has brought cultural enrichment to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| and the visitors who come there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| you would have to come yourself and see the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| when they come and line up to just work with the computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| You would also like to see those children leave Back Cultural Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| running and hopping and playing because they've had a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| I'm sure that most of you know that we house the memorabilia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| of the first federal black judge appointed, William Hastie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| We have that collection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| We also have the outstanding artwork of the Delaney brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| Surely you won't turn your back and let us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| We've come too far for you to walk out on us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| And thanks for listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| but I ask that you appropriate what has been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| so that we continue to be one of the best cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| and tourist attractions in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9029)|

| 2:30:44| Carol Borges, and I live at 2511 Adair Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| I think I'm your token white person right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| I'm also speaking on behalf of senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| who are coming to your wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| I just moved here from Boston about five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| I Googled myself here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| I didn't know anyone in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| I got on the computer because somebody told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| they'd buy me a house that was under $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| and I hit the computer and I started looking at criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| I knew that I wanted to be someplace safe because I'm getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| I wanted to be someplace that had culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| because I live and breathe art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| I'm a writer and a poet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| I wanted to be near a university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| and I wanted to be in a place that really appreciated their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| So there I was in Boston Googling Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| Googling Turkey Creek, Googling the library, Googling everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| and I Googled the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| and I was like, wow, this is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| a really wonderful little institution they have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| I belong to an organization called No Place for Hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| in Hull, Massachusetts, where I lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| and we had signs at the beginning of our town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| that's pronounced real loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| This city is a No Place for Hate city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| and they meant it, and their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| like I experienced your government here so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| until this horrible thing happened with the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| Yes, the whole community, the government here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| is behind making this place a wonderful example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| of No Place for Hate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| You are so rich in having the Beck Center here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| I don't even know if you realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| Maybe you've never even been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| I didn't know until I went to the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| that there are slaves of Andrew Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| buried on Knox College campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| I didn't know, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| that the city was removed, parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| There were thriving black communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| and people had to rebuild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| There's so much history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| And I'm so proud of your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| and to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| I heard one of my white friends yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| make the statement, someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| where's the ghetto here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| And he said, we don't have a ghetto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| And I was like, we really don't have a ghetto here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| We have a nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| It's on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| Not everybody goes there to see all the beautiful homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| to visit the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| to see the beautiful statue of the wonderful writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| There's so much here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| And I think this is a stab in the heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| to that community of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| white and black and Hispanic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| who really believe that Knoxville is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| as some people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| just an amazingly outstanding place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| because of our caring about each other interculturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| This is a unique city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| And I hope that you wouldn't do anything to destroy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| You're standing at a crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| where you can help build this bridge between communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| or you can be the knife that stabs it in the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| And I really hope you won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| And I feel emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| Linda Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| If you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| It's Lida Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| 4721 Clark Drive, 37938 in North Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9257)|
| 2:34:25| And something that she said made me think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| I'm wondering if I could possibly see a show of hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| of the people up there who've been to Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| I'm pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| Who's been to Green McAdoo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| I know if you try to go to Green McAdoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| you'll find better signage for getting there out in Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| By far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Knox County doesn't promote East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| We don't promote the Knoxville Botanical Gardens, which are a gem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| We don't promote sufficiently Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| I know we don't promote the use of libraries in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9299)|
| 2:35:08| I'm a member of St. Luke's Episcopal Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| and a close neighbor to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| We also are open for community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| but for the big ones, we go to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| We don't have the room for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| I haven't heard talk about closing the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| The archives at Beck are phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| The help in finding what you need out of the archives are phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| It's such an incredible resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| The library keeps moving further and further out toward Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| I can remember when people in East Knoxville in the area of Beck could walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| It wasn't easy, but could walk to the library after the Carnegie closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| and after urban removal moved them away from the downtown library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| The Knox County Library has moved further and further toward Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| so the people who drive don't have to drive this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| And it's out of reach for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| I've opened a book exchange at our church because there is such a hunger there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| Beck is one of the things that fills that hunger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| They have computers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| They don't have them at the county clerk's office any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| They don't have them at the library that isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| That's a very valuable resource right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| And we've put so much money into Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| And to think that, oh, well, we spent all this money, now we should stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9394)|
| 2:36:41| It's incredulous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| And Kumba, you know, some of the things that we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| that are really valuable resources for tourism that we don't promote often enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| we're going to shut them down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| It is clearly a certain element of society that we see that for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| I know there's no recycle center that the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| so many of the people in East Knoxville do not have public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| They're not going to carry their recycle on the bus out to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| And I've begged for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| We have, you know, when you have Five Points Market in there, recycle center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| which would help with all the issues that we as Friends of Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| I'm co-founder of Friends of Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| deal with the cars in the creek there that you wouldn't see other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| When we had a cleanup, the promised dumpster never showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| and the refuse was left on the traffic island for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| This is not an equivalent place to Blunt Mansion or Ramsey House or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9460)|
| 2:37:54| This is so much more than just an old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| It's an incredible old house, but it is that community touch point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| And there's far too few of those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| What was a thriving community was dispersed to a large extent back, I guess, in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9487)|
| 2:38:14| back in my younger days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| And we haven't really rebuilt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| We just don't give enough resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| Anyway, that's basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9505)|
| 2:38:32| Yeah, I spent time in Germany back in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| and I found it appalling the extent to which the young people really weren't aware of their history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9517)|
| 2:38:45| And if we close back and the history that they provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| if we don't look at our history, we're liable to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9530)|
| 2:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Leroy Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9539)|
| 2:39:07| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| My name is Leroy Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| I live on 6312 Shatsbury Drive, 24 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9550)|
| 2:39:15| I've been living in Knoxville all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| and I'd just like to say thank you to Mr. Rollins for your program that you have made here in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9557)|
| 2:39:24| I feel as if Knoxville needs to become more progressive instead of degressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| Here in the past couple of months, I've been in a hardship moment myself, and I had to reeducate myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9571)|
| 2:39:39| And the Beck Culture Center provided a place for me to go to educate myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| and I feel as if I need this place to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| There's not a lot of programs here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| There's not a lot of programs here in Tennessee in general that helps their own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| And I feel as if if you cut out those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| you'll be cutting out the life of those people that are striving to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| Me personally, I came here within the past like eight to seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9605)|
| 2:40:14| I reeducated myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9614)|
| 2:40:15| I entered classes at Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| I studied at the Beck Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| I received my GED this past January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| And, you know, the Beck Culture Center provided computers for me to educate myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| when there was closing times at Pellissippi State where I couldn't go there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| So I'd just like to say thank you for helping me move forward and be progressive with my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9632)|
| 2:40:38| And I feel as if we cut funding away from the Beck Culture System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| we'll be cutting away from my life and probably multiple other people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| Also, there's a lot of youth in my neighborhood that are lost, that need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| And Beck Culture Center provides that for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| So if you can, please be generous to us and not cut back our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| And all I've got to say is just be progressive, not digressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| We have three more people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| Kimberly Leffall, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| I want to make sure I get the name correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| And then we'll hear from Judy Paris and then Nkeke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9674)|
| 2:41:28| Greetings. My name is Kimberly Leffall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| I was born in Natchez, Mississippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| I attended high school in Atlanta, Georgia, and college in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| I live at 4504 Exumas Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| As an African American, when I first came to Knoxville, I was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| what does Knoxville have as an African American college student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| What does Knoxville have for an African American college student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9712)|
| 2:41:57| The first place that I was ever taken to was the Beck Culture Center in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| when I was a college student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| A lot of college students that come to Knoxville, when you ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| when you have to tell them, what does Knoxville have for African Americans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| It goes silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| And then we think, the only thing I can name is the Beck Culture Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| and the Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| I remember when the Kumba Festival was first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| I was like, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| I have family that comes each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| I have never missed a Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| That's the only black event that I can name that's for African Americans in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| My family come from Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9759)|
| 2:42:44| They come from Colorado Springs, Colorado, Omaha, Nebraska,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| each year for the Kumba Festival in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| We've had numerous family reunions in Knoxville, and when they come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| they want to come in June for the Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| And if you cut the fundings for that, what do we have for African Americans in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| Can anyone tell me what will we have in Knoxville for African Americans to attend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| I attend the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| I attend several of the different events here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| I own several properties, so I do pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| And I just want to know, what will we have here in Knoxville if we cut out the Kumba,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9801)|
| 2:43:27| if we cut down the funding for the Black Culture Center, what will African Americans have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9807)|
| 2:43:35| The first African American wedding that I've ever seen in my life was at the Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| I don't know if any of you have ever seen an African American wedding or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| It's beautiful, with the drums and the dancers and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| But as an African American, I had never seen that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| But as attending the Kumba Festival, I was able to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| The Black Culture Center, I'm a foster care case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| A lot of African Americans have adopted Caucasian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| A lot of Caucasian kids have adopted African American kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| And that's where they take their kids, to the Black Culture Center for cultural diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| They attend the Kumba for cultural diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| So I'm asking you, if we do not have those places for the African American here in Knoxville, what do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9855)|
| 2:44:25| We need the funding to help keep those programs open because those programs is a great entity in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9865)|
| 2:44:33| So I'm asking that you will please reconsider and think about what do we have for African Americans in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9873)|
| 2:44:41| The Black Culture Center and the Kumba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| And I'm asking that we can continue to have the Kumba Festival and the Black Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| Thank you. Judy Paris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| Nkeke Ajanaku.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9897)|
| 2:45:02| My name is Nkeke Ajanaku. My address is 2725 Wimpole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| I live next door to the Botanical Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| So here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| For the last some years, I've agreed with so many speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| And again, I don't want to repeat what everybody's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| Technically for the Kumba Festival, the Kumba Festival started meeting a group of 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| Our first meeting and every meeting for about three years was held at the Black Culture Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| We agreed on some issues that it was sorely needed, especially in those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| to have a positive and productive representation of African American and African culture throughout the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9936)|
| 2:45:44| We know that our culture as a people here in the state of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, is a valuable concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9944)|
| 2:45:54| That when we first started the festival in 1989, having our first festival at Chill Highway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| we were determined to keep or start the activities for sure in Chill Highway Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| so that we can create an event that lifts up the image and the spirit of East Knoxville here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9964)|
| 2:46:14| So I'm saying that I have a soft feeling in my heart because Beck kind of nurtured us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9974)|
| 2:46:23| gave us advice on how we go into our 501c3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| allowed us to have the space for absolutely free so that we can continue to meet and develop this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| And all as a result, that there was a sore need, whether I think that people were aware of it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| that we needed the Beck Culture Exchange Center as an institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| It's an institution today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| Since 1975 until today, Beck is an institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10007)|
| 2:46:52| It's worked hard to expand itself to be the institution that always had the capacity to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10012)|
| 2:46:59| So I'm saying that I know that sometimes we might think that these events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| the Kumba Festival and our African American Appalachian Arts are separate and apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| but we partner on a whole lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| I think that Beck is considered our grandfather as a father institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10029)|
| 2:47:15| as a result of helping us come up to an event for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| I want to agree with some things that we've always had to operate African American Appalachian Arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| as a spirit of scarcity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| I think that's a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| I think that like the institution of Beck and our institution, which is 23 years old this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| that it's evolved into an institution for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10056)|
| 2:47:39| I think that we have very few institutions that grew out of the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10059)|
| 2:47:46| the principles and the need of the African American community here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| I think that it's not proper to lock everybody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| I think they should be considered based on the need of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| I think that it's inappropriate to cut our institutions down immediately without warning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| no planning for reduction if that's what it took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| It's just something that's not appropriate about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| that I think that we shouldn't be in a position that we're pitted against each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| in any shape, form or fashion as African American institutions because of the scarcity of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| And I'll include arts organizations and nonprofits in this community too as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10103)|
| 2:48:30| The Kuma Camp that we just undid the festival, we did the Kuma Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| I know you guys are very familiar with the African drum and dances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| which I think nationwide should be touted as one of the primary premier arts presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10116)|
| 2:48:48| that we have as an asset as opposed to something that you frowned upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| I think that the hotel motel tax is appropriate as a means of funding not only for the Kuma Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10133)|
| 2:49:01| but for Beck Cultural Exchange Center and all arts organizations in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10141)|
| 2:49:07| I don't know that we speak about it a lot and we've gotten the county commission's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| on how much arts organizations suffer in relationship to having positive arts presentations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10152)|
| 2:49:21| We've always dealt with scarcity in relation to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| but art has the capacity to be a primary tourism draw for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| It just is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| And we look at our presentation with the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| It's not just, it is for entertainment and cultural inspiration and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| but it's also an economic development draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| We've never been marketed through the tourism and sports corporation that I'm satisfied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| I don't know if other arts agencies tell you the same thing, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| I don't see how, for instance, that the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10191)|
| 2:49:56| although they have a right for funding, how they're special as an institution and Beck is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| I think Beck is older than the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| I'm sure the county, I'm just not exactly sure, put money into the building of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| It was not cut down at the knees the next year or so after a capital campaign to do that expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10212)|
| 2:50:19| or the building of that entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| It's something that's not right in relationship to, it's a disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| I also want to say that based on my information, current and current data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10227)|
| 2:50:33| that man began in the continent of Africa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| Everybody is from Africa unless it's disproved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| We haven't found the oldest skeletons of man on the continent of Africa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| So I'm saying that to say that it shouldn't be looked at as if it's something that, it's just a fad or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10245)|
| 2:50:52| It's a historical reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| People use the comments that if you don't know your past, how can you go to the future and develop your present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10255)|
| 2:51:03| That's also true in what we do as an organization here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10263)|
| 2:51:08| I know some of you commissioners are familiar with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| A lot of times in the last, most times in the last five years we've had to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10271)|
| 2:51:16| and again beg that we can receive funding and or continue funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| I want to take that word beg out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| I hear that a lot when I'm talking and negotiating for funds in our public entities in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10285)|
| 2:51:30| It's not about begging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| You know, we're not coming to beg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| And how are we considered a burden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| Again, we pay taxes, property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| Every time your friends, family, visitors, business people come to a hotel in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10299)|
| 2:51:45| they're charged five percent, you know, to come back to what we're talking about doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10305)|
| 2:51:50| I think that it's appropriate for us to be in the hotel-motel tax category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| But I'm not sure that everybody who's being funded with motel-hotel tax is asked to come through the community grants process either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10316)|
| 2:52:04| I would like that question answered, Commissioner McKenzie, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| Does everybody who receives hotel-motel tax make applications for the community grant fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| Is that, you know, and what criteria do you have to actually get those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| My understanding is that those funds are set up to promote tourism in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10341)|
