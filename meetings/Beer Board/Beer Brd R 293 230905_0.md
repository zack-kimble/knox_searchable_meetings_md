| 0:02:12| From the Business Tax Office side, file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230905?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| From the KPD side, no applicable record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230905?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| but the task class is incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230905?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230905?start=142)|

| 0:02:29| so it will be a pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230905?start=149)|
