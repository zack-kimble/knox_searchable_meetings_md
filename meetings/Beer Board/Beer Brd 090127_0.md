| 0:00:33| The Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| It's Trevor Hill and my residence or the property address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| You pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| 1105 Forest Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Councilman Holtquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| This applicant has an application in with the ABC for a liquor license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| Yes, ma'am, which has been approved pending the ABC inspection and the certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| I gave you all a copy of the letter from the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| I was just going to ask that question because that was my understanding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| Your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| It will stay on until you turn it off, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| I thought you might have had something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| It actually came on after you got through talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| You're kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Well, this is going to be a long evening, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Councilman Holtquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Did anybody make a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| That's what I was about to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Any remaining documentation to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| And does that include the fact that they have the ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Because they're not eligible for a beer permit until they have the ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Including receipt of the ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| And that my second would also include that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Councilman Roddick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Councilman Holtquist, have you had any communication with the Muslim community of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Only the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| I just wanted to make sure that if there were anybody here from that community or they were watching television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| that they understood how this process works and that we weren't ignoring their communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Well, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| And, Mr. Swanson, you can step in as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| But since they have applied for their ABC permit, their liquor permit from the state, that overrides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| If they get the ABC permit, that overrides any distance requirements as far as churches, schools, and other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| And it really kind of ties our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| We're pretty much obligated to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| So while some of us might agree with their concerns to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| that's really not part of the equation if they get their ABC permit as they have applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| I just wanted to indicate for the record that I think all of us received the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| and we respect that the mosque has some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| But because of the way the process works with the liquor permit from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| as Councilman Holtquist says, it ties our hands on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| In the past, it seems like we've always waited until they actually had a liquor permit in hand before we did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| and actually had postponed them until they got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Most of the occasions that I can recall in the past that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| There may have been occasions also when we've approved it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| including a receipt of the ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| I suspect Ms. Martin probably knows the answer to that question better than I do because her memory is better than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| Not true, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| But I think you're correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| And please rest assured that whatever your instructions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| that is exactly what will happen in terms of the process followed in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I was just going to tell Mr. Hill that this would be good when we receive it or you bring it to us, whichever comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| As far as the ABC card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Oh, I'll have it to you the day I get it, probably within 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| I did have my light on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| This is not a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| I was just going to make a similar comment to what Ms. Roddy made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| And also just want to encourage Mr. Hill and his neighbors, who will be the mosque folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=298)|
| 0:05:09| who are kind enough to write a letter to us and state their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| It would just be good if you all could become good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| and I would really encourage you to have some conversations and take that into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| especially because the children are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| And so I know that you will, but I would just like to encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Well, I've made every attempt and been very pleasant and continue to want to be very pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| I don't want to have any bad neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| They've actually moved their school out to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| They had a bunch of modular trailers sitting on the piece of property across from the mosque that were placed there illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| and they were forced to remove them about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| They were permitted for one and had about ten of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| And when they removed them, they moved their school out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Well, I was actually in conversation with someone today who knew that those temporary structures had been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| and I was not informed that they had been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| They have been removed from the property and they've moved their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| You know, I get along with them just fine, and I'm just trying to make a living like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| I'm bringing a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I've invested a lot of money into the city and county of Knoxville, pay my taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| and I'm looking at hiring 60 new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| About half of that has been filled, and with the economy being what it is, that's what we need, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| is, you know, tax dollars and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| I tend to agree with sort of the issue you raised, Mr. Hall, about what our past practice has been on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| sort of waiting for folks to come in with the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| That feels like a cleaner way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| So I might vote against this motion for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| And I know I'm especially concerned because I think in the past where there's been no opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| we've continued to do that with folks, and where there is neighborhood concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| it feels a little unfortunate to move differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| And I have the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| I wanted to ask Councilman Holquist, does your pending final documentation include the ABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| Yes, I did stipulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And, you know, council members, I'm sort of looking at the inevitability of the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| but I agree with the concerns that if council members are more comfortable postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| then I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| It may affect Mr. Hill's schedule a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| I don't know how much he'd have to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| and I think he may want to address that, Mr. Hill, in terms of how that would impact your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| Because you don't know yet when you're going to get your ABC permit exactly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Actually, as soon as they do the inspection, I think that we'll have it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| We have to have the health inspection and the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| They just finished the sprinkler system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| We should have an electrical and plumbing inspection and final this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| With that being said, we'll close the place up and it will be ready to go in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| I would really hate to have to wait another 30 days to be back on the agenda when I get my ABC card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| May I speak briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I'm Hank Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I'm Trevor's father, and I'm also a participant in this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Obviously, we wouldn't attempt to get the beer permit without the ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| but there is a substantial amount of money on the line and financing costs being what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| It would be a fairly substantial amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| And I think that the city and this council is protected by the proviso that there be an ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| It's the beer code that allows for that exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| And I would point out that we are in the central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| We've been zoned into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| And I think that your code also contemplates businesses inside the central business district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| at least as it's bounded in your code, being exempt from the 300-foot limit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=548)|
| 0:09:18| It appears to me, at least the way it's drafted in your code, that's the intent of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| is to make the central business district exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| But we wouldn't attempt to do anything without an ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| And we don't want to go behind anybody's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| And, of course, I think you're covered when you make the proviso that we bring the ABC license in before any steps are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| I think my main objection to it, and I will be voting no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| is for the reason that since I have been on this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| we have never voted to approve a beer permit that didn't meet the district's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| Now, whether technically that will become void at some point, that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| If we vote to approve this, we're doing away with the distance requirement for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| Because right now they do not have a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| You were shaking your head there about the 300-foot distance requirement not being applicable in the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| Care to put that in words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| I'm unaware of any provision of the code that exempts the central business district from the distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| But there is still the provision of the code that exempts from the distance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| any establishment that has a liquor by the drink permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| So that exemption would apply if, in fact, they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| And second, even if the school was moved, the church remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| So there's the distance issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And I would point out to Councilman Holquist that a motion to postpone takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| And, in fact, I'm going to withdraw my motion to approve, depending on, you know, documentation, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| and will make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Well, then that would call on me to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| For a special call beer board meeting to start immediately five minutes before the regular council meeting two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| I believe we have one scheduled anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| We have requested one, so that would be certainly easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I normally don't like to do those, but sometimes you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Yeah, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I think that that would answer my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| I had some other comments, but I think they're not necessary now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And I just wanted to just mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| You understand that we're going to have a special call board meeting in two weeks, and that probably would satisfy your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| I guess I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I'm always a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| I remember a meeting once where we all said we're going to cut out these special call meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| You know, we got to we got to tighten the ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| And I guess in this case it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| And I guess I'm a little and I was late and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| Why would we be having a special call meeting anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| We have an application we're expecting to have in our hands tomorrow or Thursday that we believe should be considered by the board before the elapse of 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=739)|
| 0:12:30| And I'll be glad to talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Maybe talk with all of us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| A local business lost their beer permit, and it was technicality in our beer code, which I don't disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=758)|
| 0:12:49| But we're trying to assist them to get re-permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| I think that the application will, I mean, I think the meeting for both of these applications will take you five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| It's not going to be any special problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Mr. Swanson, I was curious about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| If they were not applying for an ABC permit, these distance requirements would be in play, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| And we can't just ignore them because we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| And we can't even ignore them if the church says they want to ignore them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| And I would just comment to Councilman Becker that that is the reason that I think it's valid that we consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| I believe someone used the word inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| It is inevitable that when that license is in their possession, then we are in a position of being required to approve the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=820)|
| 0:13:51| So, therefore, I feel it's appropriate that we consider this in a special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| because obviously there is expense to someone who is financing a business and isn't yet ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=836)|
| 0:14:06| So I think that seems very reasonable to me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| We're fine with two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| So we have a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Can I presume Mr. Swann is the council's attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Swanson, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Can I get your first name, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| I'll communicate with you in writing to confirm all the things we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Knoxville Opera Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| My name is Don Townsend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| I'm the production manager for Knoxville Opera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| And I'm here representing the Opera's Rossini Festival in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Mr. Townsend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Later on on the city council agenda, there's a redevelopment district that I think encompasses your all's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Are you sticking around for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| I didn't know it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| So, no, I hadn't planned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| But thank you for letting me know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| You might want to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| You might want to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| I guess I can say you might not either, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Well, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Are you all on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| No, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| We rent from Mundy Realty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| San Juan, the Largos Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=955)|
| 0:16:09| We can make a motion to postpone it until the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| San Juan, the Largos Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| You know, this one has been on here several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| It failed to appear in November and December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| And I believe they had a letter expressing the importance of being present this evening if they wanted to continue to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=989)|
| 0:16:43| Well, it's hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| We can't withdraw it for them, but we can deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| I make a motion to deny based on failure to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| We can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| No motion occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Yeah, I wouldn't know how to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Yeah, it's not as mean sounding that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I rule it dies for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| The item on your addendum doesn't have to be considered because they completed their requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and have picked up their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| I guess Officer Husky sent us an e-mail sort of talking about some updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| and I'm wondering if you just sort of talked about doing some things at some point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and update us on that and let us know when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| I put a copy on everyone's desk that the law department has started working on a draft for some of the beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| Some of them are minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| We've got some responsible vendors now in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| We've got, I think, four businesses, which we have to treat those differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| So we needed an ordinance to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| And the first page there is definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| If you can understand the format there, it looks like to the right it's got where she's deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| or taken something out to show the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| And are the underlying words new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| The underlying part is new, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| And if you'll see down next to the bottom, the one I'm mostly concerned with getting through sooner than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| is the definition for a private parking lot because of the game day issues and we want to get letters out and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| The rest of it, I know there's been some discussion about maybe having a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| and that's whatever is at the pleasure of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| We're not in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| It's just something that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Chairman Hull, the vice mayor is not here, and he generally sets up our workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| and assists us in making decisions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| I think my response to Officer Husky had been that I would feel better if I were better informed about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| and better understood the law and the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Because I think in the future we're going to have other establishments that come under this new regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| So, you know, I'm not a huge fan of workshops, but on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| if we could spend a few minutes in some way and determine what's the best way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| where we can get some good information from both the city law department and Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| and from Officer Husky, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| So I'll just pitch that out for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| Councilman O'Rourke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I wanted to address to the whole council while we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| one of the things that I think Officer Husky addressed us about was the possibility of bringing our fine structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| in line with what the county is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And obviously I couldn't reply to all of council to that because of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| but here in this public forum I would just like to state my support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| I think it makes sense on a lot of levels for the fine structure to be parallel between both beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| And I haven't had a chance to review this whole document yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| but Officer Husky, is that in here, the change in the fines to be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| And the increases that are suggested or the fine structure that are suggested is the same as Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| It's about page 8, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| They may have where they offer a suspension instead of a fine, like a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| I think they do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| We did not put that in ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| And it's my understanding that, I got word tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| that the county beer board may be restructuring their whole ordinances as of their last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| Well, I just know that the fine structure has been different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and I think it makes sense on a lot of levels to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| And I've got a paper here from the Metropolitan Drug Commission talking about how a lot of times raising fines helps prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1259)|
| 0:21:09| Obviously, what's happening right now, it's still continuing at a high rate of sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| I was aware that the county's fine structure was different than ours, and I think it makes a lot of sense to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1274)|
| 0:21:23| And I would support a workshop as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Is there any other business that should come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| I have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| It is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090127?start=1295)|
