| 0:03:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Okay, so we've approved the minutes so we have 20 beer permanent applications before us tonight, as well as five addendums on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| Like I said earlier in the introduction today's meeting held on zoom, and that is going to make things a little different than we're all used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| When I call the names of the businesses applying for a permit, please raise your hand in the zoom section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| You can see the controls on your zoom, and you can raise your hand that way, or if you're on the phone, you can dial pound nine, and that will let our administrator know that you're ready to be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=206)|
| 0:03:40| When you're called on please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Applicants who are approved pending file documentation still need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office during regular business hours, and applicants that have their permits approved tonight can pick up their permits after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=225)|
| 0:03:59| As I'm sharing the meeting as happened in the past. I'll be asking other members to make motions on behalf of the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| So thinking about how we're organizing the meeting today, you've already seen that we have to hold each vote by a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| So what I'm going to do to assist us in moving through this agenda as as quickly as possible, but making sure we review everything is I'm going to request that the beer board place items in certain groups for consent votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=256)|
| 0:04:30| Those items in those categories will all be of the same nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| OK, so what I'm going to be looking for is consents and really two different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| One's on applicants who've requested a deferral and one for applicants whose files are already complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| After we finish that, then all the remaining agenda items will be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| Does everyone understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| So group one is that are with have been requested to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| So, Mr. Bird, I understand that the items requested to be withdrawn are items for a breaststrokes, Knoxville for L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=304)|
| 0:05:15| Keep Knoxville beautiful for O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Las Fuentes Mexican restaurant and one of our agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Five. A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Elsa not. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| OK, so there's no vote needed on this unless Mr. Frost tells me otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| I think these have all been requested to be withdrawn so we can move on to the next group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Group two is going to be requests for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| So in this one, we're going to have to hold a couple different votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| First would be if the beer board is willing to put these on consent, then we have to make a motion to put all of these items on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| Then we'd have to actually vote on them to see to pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| So the ones in this category and these are all applicants who have asked for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| Those are items for C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200421?start=368)|
