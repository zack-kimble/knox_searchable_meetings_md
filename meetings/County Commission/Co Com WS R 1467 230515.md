|  1326.02 |  1327.02 | And it's about the present.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1326.02)            |
|  1327.02 |  1331.02 | Because at the present, if I can't retain people,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1327.02)            |
|  1331.02 |  1336.02 | then we can't attract people with the salary that we have right now.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1331.02)            |
|  1336.02 |  1340.02 | I can tell you right now, I know of, and I'll go through my notes,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1336.02)            |
|  1340.02 |  1343.02 | we have a Sevier County officer that's got nine years.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1340.02)            |
|  1343.02 |  1345.02 | He's a nine-year veteran.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1343.02)            |
|  1345.02 |  1351.02 | Makes more than my captains do at $68,000 a year.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1345.02)            |
|  1351.02 |  1353.02 | That should be embarrassing.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1351.02)            |
|  1353.02 |  1357.02 | It's embarrassing to me because when I go out and I talk to the sheriffs across the state                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1353.02)            |
|  1357.02 |  1363.02 | and whenever I tell them, look, we are the third largest county in the state of Tennessee.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1357.02)            |
|  1363.02 |  1365.02 | And where do we rank as far as our pays?                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1363.02)            |

|  1390.02 |  1394.02 | But I want to make sure that we take care of these people.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1390.02)            |
|  1394.02 |  1397.02 | Most of all, we've got to take care of this county.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1394.02)            |

|  1407.02 |  1413.02 | and I'm going to work until the last day I'm in office to make sure that this community is the best community.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1407.02)            |
|  1413.02 |  1418.02 | You hear the mayor talk about this is the best community to work, live, and play.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1413.02)            |
|  1418.02 |  1420.02 | Let's make it the best to work.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1418.02)            |
|  1420.02 |  1424.02 | Let's pay these officers, these men and women, what they deserve.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1420.02)            |
|  1424.02 |  1430.02 | Like I said, we did our research on this, and I'll be handing out to you all after I get finished.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1424.02)            |
|  1430.02 |  1436.02 | We're going to hand you out at least one handout of what CTAS has put together as far as salaries,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1430.02)            |
|  1436.02 |  1440.02 | and you'll see the numbers that I just quoted a while ago will be in there.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1436.02)            |
|  1440.02 |  1448.02 | The mayor proposed a budget last Monday to giving all of Knox County employees 3%,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1440.02)            |
|  1448.02 |  1456.02 | and then he said that he was giving an additional 5% to the sheriff's office, the captains in below.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1448.02)            |
|  1456.02 |  1460.02 | I have to contradict that, and here's why.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1456.02)            |
|  1460.02 |  1466.02 | Because when I turned my budget in, that budget was for 30%,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1460.02)            |
|  1466.02 |  1473.02 | as long as those 50 positions are in at 30%.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1466.02)            |
|  1473.02 |  1476.02 | He gave us 5%.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1473.02)            |
|  1476.02 |  1481.02 | Those numbers don't add up, and that's not true.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1476.02)            |
|  1481.02 |  1482.02 | Did I agree?                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1481.02)            |
|  1482.02 |  1495.02 | I agreed those positions to be given up with 30%, not 5%, not 6%, and not 7%, 30%.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1482.02)            |
|  1495.02 |  1502.02 | So those positions are off the table, and I think you can understand why.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=1495.02)            |

|  2028.02 |  2031.02 | I said it the other day, I think, when I talked to some of the media,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2028.02)            |

|  2636.02 |  2641.02 | does not diminish what I think the job that you do                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2636.02)            |
|  2641.02 |  2643.02 | and how important it is.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2641.02)            |
|  2643.02 |  2647.02 | I'm asking the question to your CEO of the office,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2643.02)            |
|  2647.02 |  2654.02 | and I have to answer to my constituents that call me and ask questions.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2647.02)            |
|  2654.02 |  2661.02 | And I feel like that a lot of times everybody gets a couple seconds of snippets on the news.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2654.02)            |
|  2661.02 |  2665.02 | You, the mayor, maybe some of us.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2661.02)            |
|  2665.02 |  2668.02 | And I don't think all the information actually gets out there.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2665.02)            |
|  2668.02 |  2672.02 | So for people that are here, people that are going to be watching later and right now,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2668.02)            |
|  2672.02 |  2679.02 | I think it's a good opportunity to get as much on the record for taxpayers to understand what's going on                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2672.02)            |
|  2679.02 |  2681.02 | because this is a big ask.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2679.02)            |
|  2681.02 |  2685.02 | And we're not in an economy.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2681.02)            |
|  2685.02 |  2690.02 | I don't think that any of us can say that we're in an economy,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2685.02)            |
|  2690.02 |  2694.02 | that it's easy for anybody right now.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2690.02)            |
|  2694.02 |  2695.02 | It's not easy for officers.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2694.02)            |
|  2695.02 |  2699.02 | It's not easy for our county employees who got a 3% raise.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2695.02)            |
|  2699.02 |  2705.02 | It's not easy for teachers who got a 4% raise.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2699.02)            |
|  2705.02 |  2708.02 | So it's not to diminish the officers,                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2705.02)            |
|  2708.02 |  2712.02 | and I want to make sure that that is very clear because that is not what it's about.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2708.02)            |
|  2712.02 |  2719.02 | It is to talk to the sheriff as the CEO of this organization.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2712.02)            |
|  2719.02 |  2724.02 | So if we're on the same page, then I'm ready to go.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2719.02)            |
|  2724.02 |  2728.02 | The mayor did offer an 8% raise.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2724.02)            |
|  2728.02 |  2732.02 | And when you were talking about KPD, and I've lived in Knox County all my life,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2728.02)            |
|  2732.02 |  2740.02 | so it has always been the sheriff's office has always compared the sheriff's pay with KPD.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2732.02)            |
|  2740.02 |  2742.02 | I'm not saying that's right or wrong.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2740.02)            |
|  2742.02 |  2746.02 | That's just always been the standard we've always talked about,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2742.02)            |
|  2746.02 |  2752.02 | that we would lose officers going a mile down the road and they never had to move their house.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2746.02)            |
|  2752.02 |  2757.02 | So I don't think when the mayor or when the commission looks at saying,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2752.02)            |
|  2757.02 |  2762.02 | now you're going to be making more than KPD, that is to diminish anything.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2757.02)            |
|  2762.02 |  2766.02 | It's just what the numbers are telling us.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2762.02)            |
|  2766.02 |  2770.02 | So let me just go over a few numbers.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2766.02)            |
|  2770.02 |  2775.02 | The average salary in Knox County is $41,700.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2770.02)            |
|  2775.02 |  2785.02 | With the proposed 8% salary increase proposed by Mayor Jacobs, that would put our officers at $48,399.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2775.02)            |
|  2785.02 |  2792.02 | Where the $63,303 comes in is including the benefits.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2785.02)            |
|  2792.02 |  2801.02 | If I have my math right, that is $21,603 over the average salary in Knox County.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2792.02)            |
|  2801.02 |  2808.02 | So when we talk about KPD and KCSO, there is a comparison there,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2801.02)            |
|  2808.02 |  2813.02 | and the officers will be making more with an 8% salary increase.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2808.02)            |
|  2813.02 |  2815.02 | That's a fact.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2813.02)            |
|  2815.02 |  2821.02 | Did you add the benefits in for KPD salary?                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2815.02)            |

|  2822.02 |  2826.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2822.02)            |
|  2826.02 |  2831.02 | Does the starting pay end up being more for KCO than it does for KPD next year?                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2826.02)            |

|  2832.02 |  2833.02 | Yes, it will.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2832.02)            |
|  2833.02 |  2834.02 | The starting salary will?                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2833.02)            |
|  2834.02 |  2841.02 | No, because where you're wrong is you keep saying the mayor offered 8%.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2834.02)            |
|  2841.02 |  2843.02 | No, he didn't.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2841.02)            |
|  2843.02 |  2844.02 | He offered 3%.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2843.02)            |
|  2844.02 |  2853.02 | That other 5%, as I mentioned, came from the positions that I was willing to give up on the stipulation of a 30%.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2844.02)            |
|  2853.02 |  2855.02 | So that's off the table.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2853.02)            |
|  2855.02 |  2860.02 | We'll get to the positions.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2855.02)            |
|  2860.02 |  2865.02 | I am curious where you're getting a 10% increase for chiefs.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2860.02)            |
|  2865.02 |  2868.02 | Now, we talk about recruitment and we talk about retention.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2865.02)            |
|  2868.02 |  2876.02 | I can't imagine those positions and that high of a position is a real problem for retention or recruitment.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2868.02)            |
|  2876.02 |  2880.02 | Well, part of that is because of the responsibilities that they have.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2876.02)            |
|  2880.02 |  2882.02 | They've been loyal to the agency as well.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2880.02)            |
|  2882.02 |  2885.02 | You say that they're how much?                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2882.02)            |
|  2885.02 |  2894.02 | Well, you want a 10% increase for the chiefs, right?                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2885.02)            |
|  2894.02 |  2899.02 | And that figure also is in there because here's what it ended up being, $133,000.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2894.02)            |
|  2899.02 |  2902.02 | You're thinking it's probably going to be a lot more than that.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2899.02)            |
|  2902.02 |  2906.02 | But if I don't make the adjustment, your captains are going to be making more than your chiefs,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2902.02)            |
|  2906.02 |  2909.02 | and your chiefs have more responsibility than your captains do.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2906.02)            |
|  2909.02 |  2910.02 | So it's just like anything else.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2909.02)            |
|  2910.02 |  2915.02 | If you don't make the adjustments for everybody else, it's just like your starting salary.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2910.02)            |
|  2915.02 |  2919.02 | Those people that were making, let's say if the starting salary goes to $50,000,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2915.02)            |
|  2919.02 |  2923.02 | those people who are making $49,000, they have to be adjusted.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2919.02)            |
|  2923.02 |  2928.02 | Those people who have been here for five years making $51,000 have to be adjusted.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2923.02)            |
|  2928.02 |  2930.02 | Or $51,000, I'm sorry.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2928.02)            |
|  2930.02 |  2933.02 | So all the adjustments have to be made in there.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2930.02)            |
|  2933.02 |  2936.02 | We're talking, what, four within our corrections side                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2933.02)            |
|  2936.02 |  2942.02 | and then five on the law enforcement side as far as chiefs at $133,000, and that's an issue?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2936.02)            |
|  2942.02 |  2949.02 | I mean, every bit of this is an issue, Sheriff.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2942.02)            |
|  2949.02 |  2953.02 | You talked about UOP.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2949.02)            |
|  2953.02 |  2963.02 | I think that it has to be understood by the public that UOP is an expense to the taxpayer.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2953.02)            |
|  2963.02 |  2964.02 | It is.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2963.02)            |
|  2965.02 |  2972.02 | So if we do a 30% tax increase, we have to match that in UOP, correct?                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2965.02)            |
|  2972.02 |  2973.02 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2972.02)            |
|  2973.02 |  2975.02 | We're talking millions of dollars, correct?                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2973.02)            |
|  2975.02 |  2976.02 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2975.02)            |
|  2976.02 |  2980.02 | Which I don't think that in the snippets that's been discussed.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2976.02)            |

|  2984.02 |  2994.02 | I'm just saying that is a fact that needs to be out there, and it's not been out there.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2984.02)            |
|  2994.02 |  3000.02 | I would like to talk about the 58 positions that were going to be given up.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=2994.02)            |

|  3002.02 |  3010.02 | Today I asked Director Caldwell, out of the 58 positions that were being offered up by you,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3002.02)            |
|  3010.02 |  3013.02 | how many of those were correction officers?                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3010.02)            |
|  3013.02 |  3014.02 | I was told 50.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3013.02)            |

|  3016.02 |  3023.02 | Somebody that sat on the Merit Council, we knew how bad correction numbers were down.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3016.02)            |
|  3023.02 |  3032.02 | As of right now, I think you've got 194 officers with 71 supervisors in the jail.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3023.02)            |

|  3037.02 |  3043.02 | you were going to give up 50 correction officer positions when you were short-staffed over there?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3037.02)            |

|  3047.02 |  3052.02 | When I said that I told them at that time, I probably, and may come back to commission and say,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3047.02)            |
|  3052.02 |  3059.02 | I need 10 more, 20 more positions now because people are starting to work.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3052.02)            |
|  3059.02 |  3062.02 | That was a number that we sit down with, with my command staff,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3059.02)            |
|  3062.02 |  3069.02 | with my command staff within my corrections division who have over 28 years of working in that facility                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3062.02)            |
|  3069.02 |  3071.02 | or at least within the corrections division.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3069.02)            |
|  3071.02 |  3077.02 | They know how strapped they've been now, and they understand what we're trying to do,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3071.02)            |
|  3077.02 |  3080.02 | and part of that is retention and recruiting.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3077.02)            |
|  3080.02 |  3084.02 | It has everything to do with it.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3080.02)            |
|  3084.02 |  3089.02 | I guess I'm, maybe just help me understand.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3084.02)            |
|  3089.02 |  3094.02 | If you were going to give those positions up and you got 30%                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3089.02)            |
|  3094.02 |  3102.02 | and people didn't come out in droves to be law enforcement with that 30%,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3094.02)            |
|  3102.02 |  3108.02 | you were going to be back here, if I understand it correctly, asking for those positions?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3102.02)            |
|  3108.02 |  3114.02 | Once we started filling those positions and then we started getting to a point to where we could hire some of the others,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3108.02)            |
|  3114.02 |  3115.02 | yeah, and that's what I told them.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3114.02)            |
|  3115.02 |  3117.02 | I said, look, I'm willing to come back.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3115.02)            |
|  3117.02 |  3120.02 | I may have to come back and ask for some of those positions,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3117.02)            |
|  3120.02 |  3126.02 | but it's just like everybody else that I know of within the state that I've talked to with the sheriffs.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3120.02)            |
|  3126.02 |  3131.02 | Some of the things that they're doing, we're trying to find any way and every way that we can temporarily                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3126.02)            |
|  3131.02 |  3133.02 | to be able to bring people in.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3131.02)            |
|  3133.02 |  3135.02 | You're exactly right.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3133.02)            |
|  3135.02 |  3138.02 | It may not bring in a drove of people,                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3135.02)            |
|  3138.02 |  3147.02 | but tell me what else we have as a sheriff's office to bring people here if I can't give them a salary.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3138.02)            |
|  3147.02 |  3153.02 | That just concerns me, and that seems dangerous in itself for the officers.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3147.02)            |

|  3411.02 |  3413.02 | and now they're going to be gone for another six weeks.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3411.02)            |

|  3426.02 |  3432.02 | So we have a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week job that we have to be able to fill.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3426.02)            |

|  3466.02 |  3470.02 | That was a, as I said, that would be a last resort.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3466.02)            |
|  3470.02 |  3471.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3470.02)            |
|  3471.02 |  3473.02 | Let me ask Director Moyers,                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3471.02)            |
|  3473.02 |  3478.02 | help me to understand how the process works for the sheriff to receive outside counsel.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3473.02)            |
|  3478.02 |  3484.02 | Well, if we get into a situation where there's intra-governmental litigation,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3478.02)            |
|  3484.02 |  3489.02 | where two office holders that the Knox County Law Director's Office normally represents                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3484.02)            |
|  3489.02 |  3493.02 | are in a litigation posture against each other, we step out,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3489.02)            |
|  3493.02 |  3497.02 | we hire counsel for both parties,                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3493.02)            |
|  3497.02 |  3502.02 | and we pay for it out of our budget that we have for that purpose, the outside counsel budget.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3497.02)            |
|  3502.02 |  3505.02 | Would that be an amount that you would have to agree on?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3502.02)            |
|  3505.02 |  3509.02 | And if the amount goes over that amount, then what happens?                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3505.02)            |
|  3509.02 |  3514.02 | Well, there's no limitation on the amount, on what it costs for litigation.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3509.02)            |
|  3514.02 |  3518.02 | So it could just cost Knox County taxpayers a million, million and a half dollars                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3514.02)            |
|  3518.02 |  3523.02 | for the sheriff to sue the county, the county commission, and the mayor.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3518.02)            |
|  3523.02 |  3526.02 | I would think it would be less than that, but it could be significant.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3523.02)            |
|  3526.02 |  3528.02 | Probably $500 at least.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3526.02)            |
|  3529.02 |  3536.02 | I have to say, Sheriff, talking about that lawsuit to me seems dangerous                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3529.02)            |
|  3536.02 |  3546.02 | because agencies shouldn't be suing each other because we can't come to an agreement.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3536.02)            |
|  3546.02 |  3548.02 | I'm hoping that we do.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3546.02)            |
|  3548.02 |  3556.02 | Well, hope and being willing to come to the table, you know, are two different things.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3548.02)            |
|  3557.02 |  3558.02 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3557.02)            |
|  3558.02 |  3559.02 | And it's real hard.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3558.02)            |
|  3559.02 |  3566.02 | I've already had probably ten of my constituents call me as soon as your press conference is over                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3559.02)            |
|  3566.02 |  3571.02 | saying, are you serious that we're going to sue, the sheriff is going to sue the county,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3566.02)            |
|  3571.02 |  3574.02 | and we're going to have to pay for that?                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3571.02)            |
|  3574.02 |  3582.02 | Yeah, and I had just as many supporting me.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3574.02)            |
|  3582.02 |  3593.02 | That's all of my questions, but I have to say I'm not in favor of agencies within the government                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3582.02)            |
|  3593.02 |  3599.02 | suing each other and wasting taxpayer dollars on that                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3593.02)            |
|  3599.02 |  3607.02 | because I think there's a resolution that could be met, and that's disappointing.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3599.02)            |
|  3607.02 |  3610.02 | It's still not out of the question, Commissioner.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3607.02)            |
|  3610.02 |  3613.02 | I hope so.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3610.02)            |

|  3615.02 |  3617.02 | Commissioner Schoonmaker, I saw you next.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3615.02)            |
|  3617.02 |  3620.02 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3617.02)            |
|  3620.02 |  3628.02 | Sheriff, I'm a numbers guy, as you know, so I just want to clarify some things with you.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3620.02)            |

|  3665.02 |  3668.02 | Allison Rogers, Knott's County Sheriff's Office.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3665.02)            |
|  3668.02 |  3671.02 | Last year's budget was a little over $95 million.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3668.02)            |
|  3671.02 |  3675.02 | I believe I saw in this proposed budget it's actually $101 million.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3671.02)            |
|  3675.02 |  3680.02 | I think there's a couple other departments not part of the sheriff's office that's listed as public safety.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3675.02)            |
|  3680.02 |  3682.02 | Okay, so it's $101 million.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3680.02)            |
|  3682.02 |  3684.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3682.02)            |
|  3684.02 |  3693.02 | And the sheriff indicated that our current, we know that coming up, our tax rate will generate about $1.9 million.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3684.02)            |
|  3693.02 |  3694.02 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3693.02)            |
|  3694.02 |  3700.02 | So that comes to, at the seven cents, that comes to $13,300,000.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3694.02)            |
|  3700.02 |  3701.02 | Pretty close.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3700.02)            |
|  3701.02 |  3709.02 | So when he's talking about the 30%, that sounds great, but what is the actual number that he needs to do what he needs to do                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3701.02)            |
|  3709.02 |  3714.02 | to get everybody, the raises, up to, I mean, below captains?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3709.02)            |
|  3714.02 |  3716.02 | What is that dollar amount?                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3714.02)            |

|  3740.02 |  3748.02 | We took what was already proposed in the budget for FY24, so we took those expenses off, the $2.3 million,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3740.02)            |
|  3748.02 |  3751.02 | those 58 positions he was willing to give up.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3748.02)            |
|  3751.02 |  3757.02 | We also took the benefits associated with that, along with the 3% in pay raises.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3751.02)            |

|  3792.02 |  3796.02 | Has that consultant submitted that report to the sheriff's office?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3792.02)            |
|  3796.02 |  3797.02 | No, sir.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3796.02)            |
|  3797.02 |  3800.02 | Unfortunately, they emailed me back and said they could not finish the report.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3797.02)            |
|  3800.02 |  3805.02 | It started during COVID, and they did not have the staff and could not give us the final results.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3800.02)            |
|  3805.02 |  3808.02 | So we never received any final results.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3805.02)            |
|  3808.02 |  3809.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3808.02)            |
|  3809.02 |  3816.02 | And then you never reinstituted that mechanism of a consultant to look at the salaries?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3809.02)            |
|  3816.02 |  3817.02 | We have not.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3816.02)            |
|  3817.02 |  3818.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3817.02)            |
|  3818.02 |  3822.02 | Did it end up costing you any money then since they didn't even do any work?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3818.02)            |
|  3822.02 |  3828.02 | How they originally charged us, it was a total of $24,999 they charged us for that study.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3822.02)            |
|  3828.02 |  3832.02 | We paid, what they gave us was, I think it was phase one and two.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3828.02)            |
|  3832.02 |  3834.02 | We did have to pay about half of that.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3832.02)            |
|  3834.02 |  3838.02 | Of course, we paid that up front once they completed those phases.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3834.02)            |
|  3838.02 |  3842.02 | And so since they did not complete phase three and four, we did not pay that part.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3838.02)            |
|  3842.02 |  3843.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3842.02)            |
|  3843.02 |  3846.02 | So is any of that information that they provided to you relevant?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3843.02)            |
|  3846.02 |  3848.02 | No, it's three years old.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3846.02)            |
|  3848.02 |  3849.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3848.02)            |
|  3849.02 |  3850.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3849.02)            |

|  3856.02 |  3859.02 | Commissioner Lee, you're recognized.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3856.02)            |

|  3862.02 |  3869.02 | Sheriff and all you law enforcements that are here, I just want to tell you thank you for showing up today,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3862.02)            |
|  3869.02 |  3876.02 | and thank you for what you do, and thank you for all the officers that put your life on the line every day.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3869.02)            |
|  3877.02 |  3889.02 | Sheriff, I just want to ask you, what can we cut out of the budget?                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3877.02)            |
|  3889.02 |  3896.02 | Well, I'm not sure where you can cut from.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3889.02)            |
|  3896.02 |  3903.02 | My attempt to show my good faith was trying to cut at least $2.3 million off of it.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3896.02)            |
|  3903.02 |  3909.02 | But that's why you all have that decision to say yes or no.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3903.02)            |
|  3909.02 |  3914.02 | You have that authority, and you have the authority to make adjustments if you will.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3909.02)            |
|  3914.02 |  3922.02 | Obviously, I understand that the mayor also has another authority as well to either veto it or whatever,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3914.02)            |
|  3922.02 |  3929.02 | but it's because of the tough decisions that I make that I have to come to here                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3922.02)            |

|  3949.02 |  3951.02 | For the PREA, the relief factor?                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3949.02)            |
|  3951.02 |  3953.02 | Yeah, I'm pretty sure that we have that.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3951.02)            |
|  3953.02 |  3955.02 | I know we keep up with the PREA stats anyway.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3953.02)            |
|  3955.02 |  3957.02 | Okay, can you provide us that?                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3955.02)            |
|  3957.02 |  3961.02 | Yeah, I'll get with our jail people.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3957.02)            |
|  3962.02 |  3966.02 | And if I could ask the law director,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3962.02)            |
|  3966.02 |  3973.02 | is the law department going to pay for a lawsuit out of the law director's budget?                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3966.02)            |
|  3973.02 |  3978.02 | We have, and have every year, a budgetary line item for outside counsel,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3973.02)            |
|  3978.02 |  3983.02 | and it is specifically for those circumstances where we have a conflict                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3978.02)            |
|  3983.02 |  3986.02 | and have to hire outside counsel.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3983.02)            |
|  3986.02 |  3988.02 | In the past, when I was law director before,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3986.02)            |
|  3988.02 |  3996.02 | that was mostly to deal with lawsuits by particular people against elected officials.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3988.02)            |
|  3996.02 |  4002.02 | But it's also what we have used traditionally when there, on the rare occasion,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=3996.02)            |
|  4002.02 |  4005.02 | is intra-governmental litigation.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4002.02)            |
|  4005.02 |  4008.02 | So, for example, back when I was law director,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4005.02)            |
|  4008.02 |  4012.02 | the school board sued the county and the law director's office                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4008.02)            |
|  4012.02 |  4015.02 | and the county mayor over some disagreements.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4012.02)            |
|  4015.02 |  4017.02 | So these things happen occasionally.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4015.02)            |
|  4017.02 |  4023.02 | The state law provides specifically for salary suits.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4017.02)            |
|  4023.02 |  4027.02 | It is a fairly archaic way of doing business,                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4023.02)            |
|  4027.02 |  4031.02 | but generally what happens each and every year is this body will pass a budget                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4027.02)            |
|  4031.02 |  4035.02 | and the various elected officials that have the salary suits will file,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4031.02)            |
|  4035.02 |  4039.02 | basically to comply with the law, a salary suit that's signed off by the mayor                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4035.02)            |
|  4039.02 |  4043.02 | because there's been an agreement between the parties.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4039.02)            |
|  4044.02 |  4051.02 | But the provision is there for the elected official to litigate, if necessary,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4044.02)            |
|  4051.02 |  4056.02 | for the number of positions and the salary level that he or she believes is necessary                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4051.02)            |
|  4056.02 |  4061.02 | for him, she, or him to carry out his constitutional duties.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4056.02)            |
|  4061.02 |  4065.02 | In this particular case, the sheriff is charged with process service,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4061.02)            |
|  4065.02 |  4071.02 | maintaining the jail, and being the chief law enforcement officer of this county.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4065.02)            |
|  4071.02 |  4076.02 | He has an opinion about what's required to carry out his constitutional duties,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4071.02)            |
|  4076.02 |  4083.02 | and if, in his opinion, he has not provided sufficient resources to make that happen,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4076.02)            |

|  4089.02 |  4094.02 | The judge at that point can agree, disagree, land somewhere in the middle,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4089.02)            |
|  4094.02 |  4098.02 | but that's how salary suits work.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4094.02)            |
|  4098.02 |  4100.02 | My memory goes back pretty far.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4098.02)            |
|  4100.02 |  4106.02 | I can't remember us having a contested salary suit in Knox County in the last 40 years,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4100.02)            |
|  4106.02 |  4109.02 | but I stand to be corrected on that.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4106.02)            |
|  4109.02 |  4115.02 | And does the amount for that have to be approved by the commission, or how is that?                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4109.02)            |
|  4115.02 |  4118.02 | It is part of our budgetary line item every year.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4115.02)            |
|  4118.02 |  4124.02 | I think, David, it's about $400,000.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4118.02)            |
|  4124.02 |  4127.02 | It's part of our budget each and every year.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4124.02)            |
|  4127.02 |  4132.02 | Most years I think we don't come anywhere close to utilizing it, but it's there if we need it.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4127.02)            |
|  4132.02 |  4138.02 | In the past there have been times where we met and exceeded it under some pretty extraordinary circumstances,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4132.02)            |
|  4138.02 |  4142.02 | but I don't think that's happened in a while.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4138.02)            |

|  4143.02 |  4151.02 | And if I could ask Mr. Caldwell to come up.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4143.02)            |
|  4151.02 |  4174.02 | Director Caldwell, could you please come to the podium?                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4151.02)            |
|  4174.02 |  4182.02 | Mr. Caldwell, I believe I had asked you previously about the UOP.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4174.02)            |
|  4182.02 |  4189.02 | If I'm not mistaken, was it in five years that it would cost the county $60 million?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4182.02)            |
|  4189.02 |  4200.02 | So the 30% increase on UOP that we had the actuary to do the calculation of,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4189.02)            |
|  4200.02 |  4204.02 | I know the impact is $60 million over 20 years.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4200.02)            |
|  4204.02 |  4209.02 | I do believe that five years from now it was close to $60 million.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4204.02)            |
|  4209.02 |  4211.02 | I think it capped at about $19 million.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4209.02)            |
|  4211.02 |  4213.02 | I think in five years it was about $16 million.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4211.02)            |
|  4213.02 |  4214.02 | $16 million.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4213.02)            |
|  4214.02 |  4215.02 | I believe that is correct.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4214.02)            |

|  4259.02 |  4263.02 | Obviously, it's taken a toll even when COVID started,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4259.02)            |
|  4263.02 |  4267.02 | and that's when it started really going downhill.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4263.02)            |
|  4267.02 |  4275.02 | But is it fair to say that you have been short several dozens of officers for years?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4267.02)            |
|  4275.02 |  4279.02 | Not as bad as we are right now, no.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4275.02)            |
|  4279.02 |  4286.02 | Is it fair to say that you have been short several dozens of officers for the past several years?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4279.02)            |
|  4286.02 |  4290.02 | No, I wouldn't say several dozens for the past several years, no.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4286.02)            |
|  4290.02 |  4299.02 | When I came into office, we may have had a total of maybe 25 to 30 vacancies or what have you,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4290.02)            |
|  4299.02 |  4301.02 | and that would include civilians as well.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4299.02)            |
|  4301.02 |  4304.02 | Okay, so it's about doubled then since you've been in office?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4301.02)            |
|  4304.02 |  4308.02 | It's probably doubled or tripled, yes.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4304.02)            |
|  4308.02 |  4313.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4308.02)            |
|  4313.02 |  4318.02 | Just because we're running, I mean, this is taking a lot of time,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4313.02)            |
|  4318.02 |  4322.02 | but one thing I just would like to clarify with you,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4318.02)            |
|  4322.02 |  4328.02 | I'm actually one of the commissioners that is a member of the Pension and Retirement Board,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4322.02)            |
|  4328.02 |  4331.02 | and I was at that meeting on Friday,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4328.02)            |
|  4332.02 |  4338.02 | and I'm not real sure exactly what you heard or how you heard it                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4332.02)            |
|  4338.02 |  4344.02 | or why you reacted the way that you did from what I heard you say.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4338.02)            |
|  4344.02 |  4357.02 | I mean, you made the statement that we were threatening to take benefits away,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4344.02)            |
|  4357.02 |  4360.02 | and I will tell you I was there.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4357.02)            |
|  4360.02 |  4370.02 | I spent over two hours talking about the what-ifs if a 30% pay raise was to be implemented,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4360.02)            |
|  4370.02 |  4374.02 | and never one time was there anything threatening said,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4370.02)            |
|  4374.02 |  4383.02 | and never one time was there ever, ever an implication that anything that any sheriff's deputy has already earned                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4374.02)            |
|  4383.02 |  4387.02 | was going to be taken away, not ever, ever.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4383.02)            |
|  4388.02 |  4396.02 | The charge of the Pensions and Retirements Board is to be sure that it remains fiscally sound,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4388.02)            |
|  4396.02 |  4398.02 | and that's not just for our sheriff's deputies.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4396.02)            |
|  4398.02 |  4406.02 | That's for any employees that are members of the several retirement systems that fall under that,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4398.02)            |
|  4406.02 |  4414.02 | and quite honestly, when you're faced as a fiscally responsible board with the thought                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4406.02)            |
|  4414.02 |  4424.02 | and the charge of figuring out where you're going to come up with $60 million over the next 20 years                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4414.02)            |
|  4424.02 |  4433.02 | if a certain scenario was to occur is something that is very justified in talking about                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4424.02)            |
|  4433.02 |  4439.02 | and reasoning through and coming up with if this is what happens,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4433.02)            |
|  4439.02 |  4443.02 | then what are some actions that we may need to take.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4439.02)            |
|  4443.02 |  4453.02 | I really regret if you got the impression or the message that we were in any way threatening your officers,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4443.02)            |
|  4453.02 |  4456.02 | because I can assure you, sir, we were not.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4453.02)            |
|  4456.02 |  4458.02 | Well, I can appreciate that and thank you,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4456.02)            |
|  4458.02 |  4462.02 | and I think when it was mentioned that a possibility of freezing the pension,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4458.02)            |
|  4462.02 |  4467.02 | that may have been taken in a different light, if you will, to different people,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4462.02)            |

|  4471.02 |  4477.02 | and I've always heard it as long as I've been in office, that the UOF is costing the county money.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4471.02)            |
|  4477.02 |  4478.02 | I understand that.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4477.02)            |
|  4478.02 |  4479.02 | I do.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4478.02)            |
|  4479.02 |  4480.02 | I'm not blind to that.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4479.02)            |
|  4480.02 |  4486.02 | Our problem goes back to when the UOF was enacted,                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4480.02)            |
|  4486.02 |  4492.02 | and it had on the stipulation on the referendum that it could cost up to $0.08 property tax increase,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4486.02)            |
|  4492.02 |  4495.02 | and commission back then decided not to do it.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4492.02)            |
|  4495.02 |  4497.02 | That's why we're here today.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4495.02)            |
|  4497.02 |  4501.02 | That's why we're in the predicament we're in today, because of that move.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4497.02)            |
|  4501.02 |  4507.02 | It may not be only that thing, but your point is taken.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4501.02)            |

|  4509.02 |  4512.02 | And commissioners, and I'll leave you with this, just so you have an idea.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4509.02)            |
|  4512.02 |  4520.02 | I have 154 people right now that are eligible to retire at the end of this year.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4512.02)            |
|  4521.02 |  4526.02 | If they go out today, that kind of gives you an idea of where we are, even more so.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4521.02)            |
|  4526.02 |  4528.02 | So, thank you.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4526.02)            |
|  4528.02 |  4529.02 | Thank you, Commissioner Hill.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4528.02)            |

|  4531.02 |  4533.02 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4531.02)            |
|  4533.02 |  4539.02 | I want to first commend Sheriff Spangler for advocating on behalf of your officers.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4533.02)            |
|  4539.02 |  4542.02 | I also want to commend our officers.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4539.02)            |
|  4543.02 |  4549.02 | You know, I've had the great privilege and opportunity to call many of you friends                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4543.02)            |
|  4549.02 |  4554.02 | and also come to love dozens of you like family.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4549.02)            |
|  4554.02 |  4558.02 | And I think Commissioner Oster said it best.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4554.02)            |
|  4558.02 |  4566.02 | This has nothing to do with our level of respect or support or how we value you.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4558.02)            |
|  4566.02 |  4568.02 | That's not what this is about.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4566.02)            |
|  4568.02 |  4576.02 | You've chosen to protect and to serve us, and we can't put a price on that.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4568.02)            |
|  4578.02 |  4581.02 | You're always owed immeasurably more.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4578.02)            |
|  4581.02 |  4587.02 | And so, this is a very difficult conversation, and it's challenging.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4581.02)            |
|  4589.02 |  4596.02 | I'm kind of putting on my HR hat because I had another great opportunity to serve as an HR director.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4589.02)            |
|  4596.02 |  4608.02 | So, I kind of understand and do sympathize with the challenges that we face right now in almost every industry with recruiting and retention.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4596.02)            |
|  4608.02 |  4610.02 | This is a challenging discussion.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4608.02)            |
|  4610.02 |  4612.02 | I mean, it's not cut and dry.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4610.02)            |
|  4612.02 |  4614.02 | It's not cut and dry numbers.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4612.02)            |
|  4614.02 |  4617.02 | There are so many factors that we have to consider.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4614.02)            |
|  4617.02 |  4622.02 | So, I mean, I'm just going to spend a little bit of time kind of going over those considerations                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4617.02)            |
|  4622.02 |  4632.02 | and possibly asking questions that maybe my constituents would like answers, if we have answers, just because we have a responsibility.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4622.02)            |
|  4632.02 |  4636.02 | And I want you all to see that, that we do have a responsibility.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4632.02)            |
|  4636.02 |  4642.02 | I also understand the need and desire to compensate employees fairly and competitively.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4636.02)            |
|  4642.02 |  4644.02 | I get that.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4642.02)            |
|  4644.02 |  4649.02 | I also understand the great importance of culture in a workplace,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4644.02)            |
|  4649.02 |  4654.02 | creating an environment where employees feel valued and worthy.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4649.02)            |
|  4654.02 |  4658.02 | In fact, every employee that I've had the great opportunity of working with,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4654.02)            |
|  4658.02 |  4666.02 | they've said many times that workplace environment and support is equally, if not even more important than pay.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4658.02)            |
|  4666.02 |  4673.02 | And it's finding that balance between compensation and quality of work life that's difficult.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4666.02)            |
|  4673.02 |  4677.02 | And again, there are so many factors that we have to consider.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4673.02)            |
|  4677.02 |  4679.02 | You have to consider cost of living.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4677.02)            |
|  4679.02 |  4681.02 | You have to consider market trends.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4679.02)            |
|  4681.02 |  4689.02 | You have to consider talent pools, inflation, state and local indicators, wage and hour regulations, benefit packages,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4681.02)            |
|  4689.02 |  4693.02 | employer services and programs, even organizational structure.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4689.02)            |
|  4693.02 |  4697.02 | Again, it's not a cut and dry numbers discussion.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4693.02)            |
|  4697.02 |  4704.02 | We can't talk about salaries without talking about some of the other things.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4697.02)            |
|  4705.02 |  4709.02 | So that's what I wanted to kind of start with.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4705.02)            |
|  4709.02 |  4712.02 | This is something that I did when I was an HR director                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4709.02)            |
|  4712.02 |  4719.02 | and we were actually talking with individuals who were looking to move from outside of the county or outside of the state.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4712.02)            |
|  4719.02 |  4724.02 | I would kind of give them just kind of a glimpse of a salary value.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4719.02)            |
|  4724.02 |  4732.02 | And I did that with the patrol starting salary of 47.9 and looked at cost of living indexes.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4724.02)            |
|  4732.02 |  4738.02 | So if I had an employee coming from, let's say, Hamilton County, which is Chattanooga,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4732.02)            |
|  4738.02 |  4742.02 | they would need to make in Chattanooga 53.2.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4738.02)            |
|  4742.02 |  4746.02 | So the cost of living in Chattanooga is actually 11% higher.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4742.02)            |

|  4750.02 |  4751.02 | Food is 9% higher.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4750.02)            |
|  4751.02 |  4753.02 | Entertainment is 6% higher.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4751.02)            |
|  4753.02 |  4755.02 | And health care is 4% higher.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4753.02)            |
|  4755.02 |  4759.02 | Shelby and Memphis, again, 3% higher.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4755.02)            |

|  4795.02 |  4797.02 | Entertainment, 11% higher.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4795.02)            |
|  4797.02 |  4800.02 | And health care was comparable.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4797.02)            |
|  4800.02 |  4807.02 | So I wanted to put that out there because, again, those are a lot of, that's a piece of the consideration.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4800.02)            |
|  4807.02 |  4815.02 | Then also I had some questions about the applications that have been received over the last 12 months.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4807.02)            |
|  4815.02 |  4821.02 | It's noted that there were 372 applications received.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4815.02)            |
|  4821.02 |  4829.02 | And we hired, or you hired, 113 of those applications.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4821.02)            |
|  4829.02 |  4834.02 | Can you give me any reasons of why the others were not hired?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4829.02)            |
|  4834.02 |  4838.02 | I mean, what did you see as far as trends in applicants?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4834.02)            |
|  4838.02 |  4840.02 | That's a combination of several things, Commissioner.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4838.02)            |
|  4840.02 |  4845.02 | One, they either didn't pass the physical, they didn't pass drug screening.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4840.02)            |
|  4845.02 |  4847.02 | It could be multiple things such as that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4845.02)            |
|  4847.02 |  4849.02 | So psychological is another one.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4847.02)            |
|  4849.02 |  4855.02 | And obviously I heard somebody, and they didn't come from this commission, so why don't we lower our standards?                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4849.02)            |
|  4855.02 |  4859.02 | No, we're not lowering standards because of that.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4855.02)            |
|  4859.02 |  4868.02 | And it's always been, at least before I left, let's put it that way, there's always been a pool to pick from.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4859.02)            |
|  4868.02 |  4877.02 | So if we had 300 and some odd people in a hopper, so to speak, we don't have that hopper anymore.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4868.02)            |
|  4877.02 |  4881.02 | We might have 20 people sitting there that want to come to work here.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4877.02)            |
|  4881.02 |  4886.02 | So it's always something in there, but it could be a combination, like I said, psychological, medical,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4881.02)            |
|  4886.02 |  4888.02 | anything like that keeps it from happening.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4886.02)            |
|  4888.02 |  4891.02 | And psychological is one of the big things.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4888.02)            |
|  4892.02 |  4897.02 | So of the 113 that were hired, where were most of those positions?                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4892.02)            |
|  4897.02 |  4899.02 | Where were those individuals placed?                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4897.02)            |
|  4899.02 |  4901.02 | Most of them would be corrections.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4899.02)            |
|  4901.02 |  4906.02 | Corrections.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4901.02)            |
|  4906.02 |  4909.02 | Getting through all my notes.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4906.02)            |
|  4909.02 |  4913.02 | So the total budget we discussed is $101 million.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4909.02)            |
|  4913.02 |  4915.02 | Payroll is over half of that.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4913.02)            |
|  4915.02 |  4918.02 | That's an increase of $59 million.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4915.02)            |
|  4918.02 |  4920.02 | So where is that going?                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4918.02)            |
|  4920.02 |  4927.02 | The additional $5.9 million.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4920.02)            |
|  4927.02 |  4933.02 | The bulk of that, almost $6 million, would go for those raises that the mayor has proposed, the 3%.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4927.02)            |
|  4933.02 |  4934.02 | That's for the bulk.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4933.02)            |
|  4934.02 |  4942.02 | There's a small increase in corrections for pharmacy, drugs, food, a small, and then his overtime budget.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4934.02)            |
|  4942.02 |  4943.02 | There's been an increase.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4942.02)            |
|  4943.02 |  4952.02 | Then the other question I have is every other ask of the department or the office, their requests were met in this budget,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4943.02)            |
|  4952.02 |  4956.02 | correct, outside of the 30% salary?                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4952.02)            |
|  4956.02 |  4959.02 | We did not turn in a budget this year.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4956.02)            |
|  4959.02 |  4962.02 | The only thing we turned in was salary increases and capital.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4959.02)            |
|  4962.02 |  4964.02 | That's what we were asked for.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4962.02)            |
|  4964.02 |  4971.02 | The capital outlay, which many people, citizens, I've had this conversation over the last couple of weeks,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4964.02)            |
|  4971.02 |  4976.02 | they did not realize that any capital outlay does not come out of the sheriff's budget.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4971.02)            |
|  4976.02 |  4978.02 | It actually comes out of our budget.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4976.02)            |
|  4978.02 |  4981.02 | And that's right at $3.2 million.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4978.02)            |
|  4981.02 |  4987.02 | Are there any of those capital outlays that the office would be willing to forego?                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4981.02)            |
|  4987.02 |  4995.02 | The $3 million includes 47 vehicles where the bulk of those go to patrol, law enforcement side.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4987.02)            |
|  4995.02 |  4996.02 | The other is the body cams.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4995.02)            |
|  4996.02 |  4997.02 | It's $1 million.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4996.02)            |
|  4997.02 |  5000.02 | We cannot cut that.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=4997.02)            |
|  5001.02 |  5005.02 | And then talk to me a little bit about the Drug Task Force Fund.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5001.02)            |
|  5005.02 |  5011.02 | On average, it's around, what, $700,000, give or take.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5005.02)            |
|  5011.02 |  5013.02 | What can that money be used for?                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5011.02)            |
|  5013.02 |  5020.02 | If you're talking about the state drug fund, which is funded from the seizures, the forfeitures,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5013.02)            |
|  5020.02 |  5026.02 | that money can be spent on law enforcement purposes.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5020.02)            |
|  5026.02 |  5028.02 | It's used to buy narcotics vehicles.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5026.02)            |
|  5028.02 |  5029.02 | It's used for confidential buy money.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5028.02)            |
|  5029.02 |  5031.02 | It's used for aviation.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5029.02)            |
|  5031.02 |  5033.02 | Those are the three main uses.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5031.02)            |
|  5033.02 |  5035.02 | So could it be used for salaries?                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5033.02)            |
|  5035.02 |  5036.02 | No salaries, no.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5035.02)            |
|  5036.02 |  5038.02 | No salaries, okay.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5036.02)            |
|  5038.02 |  5042.02 | And then I think Commissioner Schoonmaker asked about the salary study.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5038.02)            |
|  5042.02 |  5051.02 | So, again, putting on my HR hat, I'm not even sure that we should even be considering any proposal                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5042.02)            |
|  5051.02 |  5054.02 | without a third-party salary study.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5051.02)            |
|  5055.02 |  5059.02 | I just think that's a critical piece of information that we just don't have.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5055.02)            |
|  5059.02 |  5065.02 | And right now it's kind of our perspective versus your perspective.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5059.02)            |
|  5065.02 |  5077.02 | And, you know, I would really like to see a comprehensive salary study conducted before we do anything.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5065.02)            |
|  5077.02 |  5080.02 | You know, I also want to comment on, you know, Sheriff,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5077.02)            |

|  5094.02 |  5096.02 | It goes before merit.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5094.02)            |
|  5096.02 |  5098.02 | That's why we have merit.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5096.02)            |
|  5098.02 |  5104.02 | And so I kind of see you like the CEO of the organization, and I'm an investor.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5098.02)            |
|  5104.02 |  5110.02 | And so I'm looking to you to identify what is your most valued asset.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5104.02)            |
|  5110.02 |  5115.02 | And if you are identifying your most valuable asset as your people,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5110.02)            |
|  5115.02 |  5123.02 | then I would want to see your budget tailored to demonstrate that.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5115.02)            |
|  5123.02 |  5130.02 | And that's something that I would actually tell my department heads and leaders                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5123.02)            |
|  5130.02 |  5135.02 | when I was helping them identify budgets when they were going through that process.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5130.02)            |
|  5135.02 |  5142.02 | And I did hear you state that you don't think the citizens would have heartburn over a property tax increase.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5135.02)            |
|  5142.02 |  5148.02 | You know, that's something that I think there needs to be some polling.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5142.02)            |
|  5148.02 |  5152.02 | I don't think we should be deciding that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5148.02)            |
|  5152.02 |  5158.02 | I think citizens should have the opportunity to have a say if they would support a property tax increase,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5152.02)            |
|  5158.02 |  5165.02 | and I think that citizens should also have a say as to where that money is going.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5158.02)            |
|  5165.02 |  5170.02 | Because we've got roads, schools, parks, teachers, public safety.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5165.02)            |

|  5173.02 |  5177.02 | You know, and I worry about property tax increases.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5173.02)            |
|  5177.02 |  5184.02 | I know that you made an example that it was kind of minimal, but it does impact our officers' home finances.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5177.02)            |

|  5187.02 |  5198.02 | It does impact our farmers' home finances and our county employees' too.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5187.02)            |
|  5198.02 |  5210.02 | I think what's also difficult for me with putting my personnel hat on is that I worry that we're making a statement                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5198.02)            |
|  5210.02 |  5221.02 | that one set of skilled employees deserve more of a raise than others.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5210.02)            |
|  5221.02 |  5228.02 | And I also worry about the precedent that it will set.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5221.02)            |
|  5228.02 |  5240.02 | I also worry about a lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5228.02)            |
|  5240.02 |  5246.02 | I'm deeply concerned about that, and I'm really disappointed that we're even having that conversation.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5240.02)            |

|  5312.02 |  5317.02 | just like they would be for any other law enforcement agency here in the local area.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5312.02)            |
|  5317.02 |  5321.02 | I would like to hear from them.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5317.02)            |
|  5321.02 |  5322.02 | I reached out to them.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5321.02)            |
|  5322.02 |  5324.02 | They said I would get a letter, so I got the letter.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5322.02)            |
|  5324.02 |  5328.02 | Again, it was very vague and just kind of general.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5324.02)            |
|  5328.02 |  5331.02 | You did talk about assessing staff levels.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5328.02)            |
|  5331.02 |  5333.02 | That's always very important to me.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5331.02)            |
|  5333.02 |  5335.02 | I would really love to see how you assess staff levels,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5333.02)            |
|  5335.02 |  5339.02 | and I know you mentioned that you'll provide that report to us.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5335.02)            |
|  5339.02 |  5344.02 | The funding for the positions that are open, there have been some open positions for over a year now.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5339.02)            |
|  5344.02 |  5347.02 | Where has that funding gone?                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5344.02)            |
|  5347.02 |  5348.02 | Where has that funding gone?                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5347.02)            |
|  5348.02 |  5352.02 | Yeah, where is that funding that was set aside for salaries?                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5348.02)            |
|  5352.02 |  5355.02 | It goes back in to the general fund, and it's still there, yes.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5352.02)            |
|  5355.02 |  5357.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5355.02)            |
|  5357.02 |  5359.02 | I also want to commend Mayor Jacobs.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5357.02)            |
|  5359.02 |  5362.02 | I'm not sure if he's here, but I kind of went back                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5359.02)            |
|  5362.02 |  5366.02 | and looked over salary increases over the last 20 years,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5362.02)            |
|  5366.02 |  5370.02 | and this is actually the largest pay raise that's ever been offered,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5366.02)            |
|  5370.02 |  5375.02 | should the 8% be adopted into this budget.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5370.02)            |
|  5375.02 |  5380.02 | That was important to me, just to look at the 20-year trend,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5375.02)            |
|  5380.02 |  5384.02 | because that's in my training.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5380.02)            |
|  5384.02 |  5394.02 | Can you talk to me a little bit about the benefits in detail that the officers receive?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5384.02)            |
|  5394.02 |  5397.02 | The benefits are basically the county benefits.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5394.02)            |
|  5397.02 |  5403.02 | They have their 401K or their pension or their STAR, depending on what plan they're on.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5397.02)            |
|  5403.02 |  5408.02 | Of course, the UOP closed in 2014, so now it's STAR or 401K.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5403.02)            |
|  5408.02 |  5413.02 | They've got the medical insurance, the dental, vision.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5408.02)            |
|  5413.02 |  5417.02 | I mean, just the typical benefits that the county employee has.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5413.02)            |
|  5417.02 |  5425.02 | Are there any plans to improve those benefits, like any continuing education or certification?                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5417.02)            |
|  5425.02 |  5429.02 | The sheriff has continuously tried to do the education benefits.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5425.02)            |
|  5429.02 |  5432.02 | We have looked at other—of course, it all costs money.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5429.02)            |
|  5432.02 |  5435.02 | We're going to run into the same issues,                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5432.02)            |
|  5435.02 |  5439.02 | that anything that he would like to try to do is going to cost money.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5435.02)            |
|  5440.02 |  5447.02 | I took a look, too, at the Join KCESO website.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5440.02)            |
|  5447.02 |  5453.02 | I know that was something that you all put out there kind of as a recruitment tool.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5447.02)            |
|  5453.02 |  5454.02 | I found it interesting.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5453.02)            |
|  5454.02 |  5458.02 | I didn't see a way to actually apply or to submit an application                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5454.02)            |
|  5458.02 |  5462.02 | or to submit a resume or pass certifications.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5458.02)            |
|  5462.02 |  5466.02 | It basically stated you fill out an inquiry form,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5462.02)            |
|  5466.02 |  5472.02 | and it asks for name, phone number, email, and tell us about yourself and your interests.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5466.02)            |
|  5472.02 |  5477.02 | As a former HR director, I'm not sure that's a useful way to attract talent,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5472.02)            |
|  5477.02 |  5482.02 | simply because you're not asking for credentials or experience.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5477.02)            |
|  5482.02 |  5488.02 | That's an open-ended question that's very subjective, and that's kind of a slippery slope.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5482.02)            |
|  5489.02 |  5496.02 | So just as a statement, I think you can expand on that recruitment tool,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5489.02)            |
|  5496.02 |  5501.02 | and that's just my macro-level first glance at it.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5496.02)            |
|  5501.02 |  5504.02 | Let me let Captain Aaron Yarnell real briefly explain that to you.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5501.02)            |
|  5504.02 |  5507.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5504.02)            |
|  5507.02 |  5509.02 | Aaron Yarnell, Knox County Sheriff's Office.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5507.02)            |
|  5509.02 |  5514.02 | I noticed he said briefly, so I'll do my best.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5509.02)            |
|  5514.02 |  5516.02 | I don't know you ever to be brief.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5514.02)            |
|  5516.02 |  5518.02 | That's great.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5516.02)            |
|  5518.02 |  5525.02 | Our thought process was to get possible recruits in contact with current officers, detectives,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5518.02)            |
|  5525.02 |  5527.02 | as quickly as possible.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5525.02)            |
|  5527.02 |  5531.02 | That way they're not having to speak with a personnel division sitting at a desk.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5527.02)            |
|  5531.02 |  5534.02 | They're actually talking to the people that they're going to be doing the job with.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5531.02)            |
|  5534.02 |  5538.02 | To do that, we added this process.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5534.02)            |
|  5538.02 |  5542.02 | The same process as before, they can still do the same way.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5538.02)            |
|  5542.02 |  5546.02 | They can still go to Knox County's website, look at the positions, apply the exact same way.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5542.02)            |
|  5546.02 |  5551.02 | This was just an initiative to help people get in contact with people that they're going to be talking to                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5546.02)            |
|  5551.02 |  5553.02 | and working beside of.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5551.02)            |
|  5553.02 |  5559.02 | What you don't see is when they fill out a form out, we assign a mentor recruiter to them                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5553.02)            |
|  5559.02 |  5566.02 | who contacts them within 24 hours to introduce themselves, also gives them a link to the application.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5559.02)            |
|  5566.02 |  5569.02 | That's where everything you're talking about comes into play.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5566.02)            |
|  5569.02 |  5573.02 | It's not there on the website, but that's what happens.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5569.02)            |
|  5573.02 |  5578.02 | I would like to see a link added to the website where it was a little bit easier.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5573.02)            |
|  5578.02 |  5582.02 | I think it's a great idea as far as mentoring.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5578.02)            |
|  5582.02 |  5586.02 | How do you select the officers who are the mentors?                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5582.02)            |
|  5586.02 |  5590.02 | We basically sent an email out and asked if anyone was interested in assisting us                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5586.02)            |
|  5590.02 |  5595.02 | because we didn't have, obviously, money to pay any extra for that                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5590.02)            |
|  5595.02 |  5598.02 | other than the normal bonuses that could be received for that.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5595.02)            |
|  5598.02 |  5599.02 | So it's voluntary?                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5598.02)            |
|  5599.02 |  5602.02 | Yes, correct. So just a volunteer basis.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5599.02)            |

|  5792.02 |  5794.02 | we're currently unable to fill.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5792.02)            |
|  5794.02 |  5800.02 | We've had a mean average of around 90 positions this year that we haven't been able to fill.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5794.02)            |
|  5800.02 |  5807.02 | Just being able to offer a salary that would allow for getting an additional 40 individuals in there                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5800.02)            |
|  5807.02 |  5810.02 | would be a great impact for us.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5807.02)            |
|  5810.02 |  5818.02 | So we're looking for any measure that we can do to possibly get more individuals into these positions.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5810.02)            |
|  5818.02 |  5822.02 | As you all well know, the corrections division is not a glamorous job.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5818.02)            |
|  5822.02 |  5827.02 | It's dealing with some of the most difficult people that our society has to offer.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5822.02)            |
|  5827.02 |  5834.02 | The challenges and the risk of injury almost on a very regular basis,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5827.02)            |
|  5834.02 |  5840.02 | we're dealing with officers who are injured in the line of doing the daily job.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5834.02)            |
|  5840.02 |  5849.02 | So many of them decide that there are safer places to go with more money.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5840.02)            |
|  5849.02 |  5853.02 | We lose some of our individuals to even the fast food industry.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5849.02)            |
|  5853.02 |  5863.02 | So it's just another effort to try to get more of a salary to attract employees into that position.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5853.02)            |
|  5863.02 |  5865.02 | Do you all do exit interviews?                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5863.02)            |

|  5867.02 |  5874.02 | Are those something that you would be willing to share?                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5867.02)            |
|  5874.02 |  5875.02 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5874.02)            |
|  5875.02 |  5881.02 | And I just say that because I had reached out to several that I know had left the office,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5875.02)            |
|  5881.02 |  5886.02 | whether in the last year to two years, and just asked a couple of questions,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5881.02)            |
|  5886.02 |  5890.02 | and pay was not one of the reasons.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5886.02)            |
|  5890.02 |  5894.02 | And I was just surprised by that.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5890.02)            |
|  5894.02 |  5899.02 | So I would be interested in seeing those exit interviews                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5894.02)            |
|  5899.02 |  5906.02 | and seeing what kind of justification there is for recruitment, retention.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5899.02)            |

|  5941.02 |  5948.02 | I don't want to raise taxes, and, you know, we always have to be like the tough guys up here.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5941.02)            |
|  5948.02 |  5954.02 | But as a guy that's served in combat, the video is terrible, yeah,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5948.02)            |
|  5954.02 |  5959.02 | but the radio call just reminds me of the radio calls that, you know, you get in Afghanistan.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5954.02)            |
|  5959.02 |  5964.02 | And I remember it just took me to a place where my friend got killed in front of me.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5959.02)            |
|  5964.02 |  5968.02 | I remember the call that he went down, and, you know, it's going to be tough to sleep tonight.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5964.02)            |
|  5968.02 |  5972.02 | And, you know, it's one of the things that gets lost in this conversation,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5968.02)            |
|  5972.02 |  5976.02 | that you guys put your life on the line every single day.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5972.02)            |
|  5976.02 |  5978.02 | That's why you guys should get paid more, right?                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5976.02)            |
|  5978.02 |  5983.02 | Because not to say these other jobs that other public people, you know, employees do,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5978.02)            |
|  5983.02 |  5989.02 | but, you know, being a cop and deciding to go in there and take a bullet is not an easy decision.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5983.02)            |
|  5989.02 |  5992.02 | There's a reason why when you go to combat, you get combat pay, right?                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5989.02)            |
|  5992.02 |  5997.02 | When you're on the, you know, state side, you don't get paid as much as when you're down range getting shot at.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5992.02)            |
|  5997.02 |  6003.02 | And not for nothing, you know, this is a great place to live, but you guys decide to go down range every day.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=5997.02)            |
|  6003.02 |  6006.02 | You put that shield on and put that uniform on.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6003.02)            |
|  6006.02 |  6011.02 | It's not an easy decision to make, you know.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6006.02)            |
|  6011.02 |  6013.02 | It's tough.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6011.02)            |
|  6013.02 |  6015.02 | It's tough saying goodbye to the kids and the family in the morning                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6013.02)            |
|  6015.02 |  6019.02 | and not knowing if you're going to walk in that door later on that day.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6015.02)            |
|  6019.02 |  6024.02 | So first off, I want to say that to all the men and women that are here that hear this.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6019.02)            |
|  6024.02 |  6028.02 | So I just wanted to let you know that I feel for your situation.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6024.02)            |
|  6028.02 |  6030.02 | I lost a piece of ear.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6028.02)            |
|  6030.02 |  6031.02 | That's all I left in Afghanistan.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6030.02)            |
|  6031.02 |  6036.02 | Luckily, I didn't lose any arms or limbs or anything else.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6031.02)            |
|  6036.02 |  6039.02 | Secondly, I'm a CEO of a fairly large company.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6036.02)            |
|  6039.02 |  6041.02 | We service 60,000 people.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6039.02)            |
|  6041.02 |  6044.02 | It is tough being the boss.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6041.02)            |
|  6044.02 |  6047.02 | Hiring people is not fun, especially these last three years.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6044.02)            |
|  6047.02 |  6048.02 | Retaining people is not fun.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6047.02)            |
|  6048.02 |  6052.02 | I'm sure if you would look at the guys that I've had to fire that have left my company,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6048.02)            |
|  6052.02 |  6054.02 | they probably wouldn't say the greatest things either.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6052.02)            |
|  6054.02 |  6060.02 | But I know the ones that I've kept, you know, part of the reason they stay is because we take very good care of them.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6054.02)            |
|  6060.02 |  6063.02 | I'm very proud that I pay well.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6060.02)            |
|  6063.02 |  6069.02 | I pay better than most of your starting guys get paid, and they get full benefits with my company.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6063.02)            |
|  6069.02 |  6074.02 | It's always an argument that I take is, you know, I know I'm in the private sector,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6069.02)            |
|  6074.02 |  6076.02 | but my guys aren't getting shot at every day.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6074.02)            |
|  6076.02 |  6079.02 | They might get a little bit dirty, but that's about it.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6076.02)            |
|  6079.02 |  6082.02 | So I wanted to say that's a challenge.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6079.02)            |
|  6082.02 |  6088.02 | And I'm a numbers guy, and as politicians, we're good at talking out of both sides of our mouths                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6082.02)            |
|  6088.02 |  6095.02 | because we make one argument about, you know, inflation and how expensive it is to live here                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6088.02)            |
|  6095.02 |  6099.02 | and the medium house income and everything else, and then the other side, we're like,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6095.02)            |
|  6099.02 |  6103.02 | oh, we can't really give you too much more money because of reason A, B, and C.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6099.02)            |
|  6103.02 |  6107.02 | You know, we unfortunately are the body that has to do the balancing act,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6103.02)            |
|  6107.02 |  6112.02 | and I don't know how you survive and buy a house here in this day and age.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6107.02)            |
|  6112.02 |  6115.02 | My wife and I had this conversation over the weekend.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6112.02)            |
|  6115.02 |  6123.02 | We're very fortunate we have two good jobs, and at the time we bought a $280,000 house.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6115.02)            |
|  6123.02 |  6128.02 | That $280,000 house with taxes and insurance was $1,500 payment.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6123.02)            |
|  6128.02 |  6135.02 | If I bought the same $280,000 house just with the inflationary rate and the interest rate,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6128.02)            |
|  6135.02 |  6138.02 | it would be $2,400 today.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6135.02)            |
|  6138.02 |  6140.02 | I couldn't afford that house just with the interest rate alone.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6138.02)            |
|  6140.02 |  6143.02 | That house today is not worth $450,000.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6140.02)            |
|  6143.02 |  6148.02 | With the interest rate, it would be a pipe dream for us to own something like that.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6143.02)            |
|  6148.02 |  6155.02 | So it's hard to, you know, tell your employees that want to live here and work here,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6148.02)            |
|  6155.02 |  6159.02 | and some of them probably were raised here, and they want to raise their kids here,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6155.02)            |
|  6159.02 |  6164.02 | hey, you know, I know you guys got to buy the $260,000 house at 3% interest rate,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6159.02)            |
|  6165.02 |  6171.02 | but now, five years later, you know, sorry kids, we're going to have to move a county over,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6165.02)            |
|  6171.02 |  6175.02 | and Dad's going to have to drive 45 minutes to work and, you know, 45 minutes back.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6171.02)            |
|  6175.02 |  6178.02 | So that's an hour every day less you have to spend with your kid.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6175.02)            |
|  6178.02 |  6182.02 | And being a new father, you know, every minute that you have to spend with your child is a blessing.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6178.02)            |
|  6182.02 |  6186.02 | So, you know, privately, and I don't mind saying this out in public.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6182.02)            |
|  6186.02 |  6189.02 | I think, Jesse, you didn't even have a conversation about it.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6186.02)            |
|  6189.02 |  6191.02 | I'm good with, like, 10%, 15%.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6189.02)            |
|  6191.02 |  6193.02 | That was where I was.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6191.02)            |
|  6193.02 |  6194.02 | You and I talked about this last year.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6193.02)            |
|  6194.02 |  6196.02 | I'm not saying anything that you don't know.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6194.02)            |
|  6196.02 |  6204.02 | 30% is tough for me personally to swallow because it's going to take on a tax increase,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6196.02)            |
|  6204.02 |  6207.02 | and I don't really have a tolerance for a tax increase.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6204.02)            |
|  6207.02 |  6210.02 | So you and I have had that conversation.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6207.02)            |
|  6210.02 |  6211.02 | You know where I stand.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6210.02)            |
|  6211.02 |  6212.02 | I want everybody else to know where I stand.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6211.02)            |
|  6212.02 |  6215.02 | That's kind of where my mentality was going in,                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6212.02)            |
|  6215.02 |  6220.02 | and I think you and I had this conversation like that $50,000 threshold is a really important one to get to,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6215.02)            |
|  6220.02 |  6222.02 | especially when it comes to hiring.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6220.02)            |
|  6222.02 |  6225.02 | That's why you saw the state say teachers need to be at 50.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6222.02)            |
|  6225.02 |  6229.02 | That's why they say, you know, state prisons need to be up at 50.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6225.02)            |

|  6329.02 |  6331.02 | I think that's a good starting point.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6329.02)            |
|  6332.02 |  6334.02 | Is there a path forward to get more?                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6332.02)            |
|  6334.02 |  6337.02 | Because I do like to get the starting salary up to 50,000 a year,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6334.02)            |
|  6337.02 |  6341.02 | I think is the right number, regardless of what the city pays.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6337.02)            |
|  6341.02 |  6344.02 | I think, you know, it's a good comparison.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6341.02)            |
|  6344.02 |  6348.02 | Like, I always want to be a dollar more than the city, always,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6344.02)            |
|  6348.02 |  6351.02 | because I want to be able to recruit.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6348.02)            |
|  6351.02 |  6354.02 | And that's who you're recruiting against at your competition.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6351.02)            |
|  6354.02 |  6359.02 | So common sense says, well, we need to be at least more than the city.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6354.02)            |
|  6359.02 |  6362.02 | And we also have a whole jail to fill up as well,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6359.02)            |
|  6362.02 |  6364.02 | not just police officers on the street.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6362.02)            |
|  6364.02 |  6369.02 | So it's not a singular argument when it comes to the city either.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6364.02)            |
|  6369.02 |  6372.02 | So that's kind of where my mind's at.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6369.02)            |
|  6372.02 |  6378.02 | Being top four, top five in the state is kind of a number that I'm                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6372.02)            |
|  6378.02 |  6381.02 | comfortable with considering the size of Chattanooga.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6378.02)            |
|  6381.02 |  6385.02 | I don't know where those numbers that Ms. Frazier came with or what the                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6381.02)            |
|  6385.02 |  6387.02 | data set is or how long ago that is.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6385.02)            |
|  6387.02 |  6389.02 | But if you look at all the counties,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6387.02)            |
|  6389.02 |  6392.02 | we're probably around the fifth most expensive county to live in.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6389.02)            |
|  6392.02 |  6396.02 | So if we're around five, that's palatable.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6392.02)            |
|  6396.02 |  6398.02 | I'd like to be higher, more of four.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6396.02)            |
|  6398.02 |  6400.02 | I like to be one because I'm competitive.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6398.02)            |
|  6400.02 |  6403.02 | But, you know, top five, I think, is a palatable number.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6400.02)            |
|  6403.02 |  6406.02 | So these are just my personal thoughts out loud.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6403.02)            |
|  6406.02 |  6411.02 | So I'm willing to work and help any way that I can.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6406.02)            |
|  6411.02 |  6414.02 | And I just want to be on the record and let everybody know that.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6411.02)            |
|  6414.02 |  6416.02 | So that's all I got.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6414.02)            |
|  6417.02 |  6418.02 | Thank you, Commissioner.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6417.02)            |
|  6418.02 |  6424.02 | And Commissioner Oster, I don't look at myself as being a CEO,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6418.02)            |
|  6424.02 |  6426.02 | but I guess that's kind of the position I'm in.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6424.02)            |
|  6426.02 |  6430.02 | But with that being said, as I told the mayor,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6426.02)            |
|  6430.02 |  6432.02 | the mayor and I are good friends.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6430.02)            |
|  6432.02 |  6436.02 | And I'm sure we'll continue to be that way.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6432.02)            |
|  6436.02 |  6439.02 | As I've told him, this is not personal.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6436.02)            |

|  6442.02 |  6446.02 | It's just business for us to be able to, as you said, to run the business.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6442.02)            |
|  6446.02 |  6451.02 | Yeah, that's what you're elected to do is run a $100 million company.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6446.02)            |
|  6451.02 |  6454.02 | And I know it's tough sometimes for people to see that,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6451.02)            |
|  6454.02 |  6457.02 | but you're not just making policing decisions.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6454.02)            |

|  6471.02 |  6475.02 | And we have to be responsible as well to the shareholders.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6471.02)            |
|  6475.02 |  6477.02 | And the shareholders in this sense, I love business,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6475.02)            |
|  6477.02 |  6479.02 | so it doesn't mind me using these analogies,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6477.02)            |
|  6479.02 |  6481.02 | but the shareholders are our county citizens.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6479.02)            |
|  6481.02 |  6486.02 | So I can't screw over my shareholders just because my CEO wants A, B, and C.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6481.02)            |

|  6566.02 |  6571.02 | Director Caldwell, a big portion is, as we've mentioned, UOP funding.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6566.02)            |
|  6571.02 |  6574.02 | Why is it so high now?                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6571.02)            |
|  6574.02 |  6580.02 | Is that because when it was instated in, I think, 2007 or 2008,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6574.02)            |
|  6580.02 |  6584.02 | because commission did not do a tax increase then?                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6580.02)            |
|  6584.02 |  6586.02 | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6584.02)            |
|  6586.02 |  6590.02 | So the commission in 2007 or 2008 chose not to raise taxes,                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6586.02)            |
|  6590.02 |  6592.02 | as the sheriff mentioned, eight cents.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6590.02)            |
|  6592.02 |  6598.02 | But what should be pointed out, I suppose,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6592.02)            |
|  6598.02 |  6603.02 | is that what commission did instead was issued a $57 million bond,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6598.02)            |
|  6603.02 |  6610.02 | taxable bond, to actuarially fund the UOP plan.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6603.02)            |
|  6610.02 |  6618.02 | We still have four more years left to pay on that bond.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6610.02)            |
|  6618.02 |  6624.02 | We did refund it in 2014 to get a little better interest rate.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6618.02)            |
|  6624.02 |  6627.02 | So I think ultimately,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6624.02)            |
|  6628.02 |  6633.02 | even if commission would have raised taxes and not issued that bond,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6628.02)            |
|  6633.02 |  6636.02 | I think our contributions today would still be high,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6633.02)            |
|  6636.02 |  6640.02 | because what's ended up happening is our discount rate has been lowered                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6636.02)            |
|  6640.02 |  6643.02 | from 7.5 down to 7,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6640.02)            |
|  6643.02 |  6648.02 | partly because the state is lowering their discount rate.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6643.02)            |
|  6648.02 |  6653.02 | Mortality rate is better than anticipated when this plan was started.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6648.02)            |
|  6653.02 |  6658.02 | Salaries, increases have been higher than what had been anticipated.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6653.02)            |
|  6658.02 |  6661.02 | People are retiring sooner, which has an impact on that.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6658.02)            |
|  6661.02 |  6664.02 | And so just to give you an idea,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6661.02)            |
|  6664.02 |  6670.02 | our contribution to UOP this year, as you are well aware, is $10.1 million.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6664.02)            |
|  6670.02 |  6674.02 | What we don't count even toward UOP,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6670.02)            |
|  6674.02 |  6678.02 | that bond payment that we're going to make in FY24,                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6674.02)            |
|  6678.02 |  6681.02 | principal and interest, is $7 million.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6678.02)            |
|  6681.02 |  6684.02 | So that's over and above.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6681.02)            |
|  6684.02 |  6686.02 | That went in to fund UOP,                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6684.02)            |
|  6686.02 |  6690.02 | and we don't count that as an expense towards UOP.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6686.02)            |
|  6690.02 |  6692.02 | We pay that through debt service.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6690.02)            |
|  6692.02 |  6696.02 | That debt will be done in 2027.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6692.02)            |
|  6696.02 |  6701.02 | But I think our contribution towards UOP would still be as high as it is today                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6696.02)            |
|  6701.02 |  6705.02 | if taxes would have been raised, because you wouldn't have issued those bonds.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6701.02)            |
|  6705.02 |  6708.02 | And so it's apples and oranges, really.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=6705.02)            |

|  7657.7  |  7663.1  | Thank you, Commissioner Durrett, Chairwoman Durrett, Kevin Murphy, 450 Murphy Road.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7657.700000000001)  |
|  7663.1  |  7670.78 | I'm going to quickly adjust this podium height, see if that will work.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7663.1)             |
|  7670.78 |  7673.98 | That's a bit better, more height appropriate, thank you.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7670.780000000001)  |
|  7673.98 |  7680.7  | I'm here speaking to the proposed ordinance regarding changes to the CA and CB zoning                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7673.9800000000005) |
|  7680.7  |  7681.7  | regulations.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7680.700000000001)  |
|  7681.7  |  7685.78 | I'm going to start with a little bit of the background.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7681.7)             |
|  7685.78 |  7690.26 | So my understanding from staff and what went through planning commission is this ordinance                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7685.78)            |
|  7690.26 |  7695.78 | started, it came out of the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7690.26)            |
|  7695.78 |  7701.06 | One of the things that was expressed in public comment there is that some of the developers                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7695.78)            |
|  7701.06 |  7705.74 | that were participating said it would really help redevelopment of the corridor if some                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7701.0599999999995) |
|  7705.74 |  7711.18 | additional uses were added to give you some more mixed use.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7705.74)            |
|  7711.18 |  7717.42 | So the ordinance in front of you, one thing that it contains is it gives CA and CB zones                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7711.18)            |
|  7717.42 |  7718.82 | a lot more residential units.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7717.42)            |
|  7718.82 |  7722.74 | There's some more multi-family that's allowed and some other things.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7718.820000000001)  |
|  7722.74 |  7727.98 | So basically there's some new give, if you're a CA, CB owner of property, anywhere in the                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7722.740000000001)  |
|  7727.98 |  7732.46 | county, you get some new uses, some new value from your property.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7727.9800000000005) |
|  7732.46 |  7736.9  | So that was one kind of where it started.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7732.46)            |
|  7736.9  |  7742.02 | So that's a win if you're an owner of those properties.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7736.900000000001)  |
|  7742.02 |  7747.5  | My understanding is that the staff was looking at the ordinance, the zoning for CA and CB,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7742.02)            |
|  7747.5  |  7752.7  | and they were talking with development staff and they realized that drive-thrus were a                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7747.500000000001)  |
|  7752.7  |  7759.54 | use that was being permitted basically as an accessory or an ancillary use to other                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7752.700000000001)  |
|  7759.54 |  7761.26 | things that were permitted in CA.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7759.540000000001)  |
|  7761.26 |  7766.58 | Like if you have a restaurant, they would say, yep, a drive-thru is part of a restaurant                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7761.26)            |
|  7766.58 |  7767.58 | so we'll do that.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7766.58)            |
|  7767.58 |  7772.34 | Or if you have a bank that's in CA, then yeah, you can have your bank teller lines.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7767.58)            |
|  7772.34 |  7777.82 | Other zones, so CA and CB are kind of silent on drive-thrus right now.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7772.34)            |
|  7777.82 |  7783.38 | Other zones, they look at drive-thrus, particularly CN and CR, and they say, well, a drive-thru                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7777.82)            |
|  7783.38 |  7791.5  | is a use on review, so there are some standards that kind of apply.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7783.38)            |
|  7791.5  |  7797.02 | So they said, well, we probably need to have standards for drive-thrus and actually address                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7791.5)             |
|  7797.02 |  7799.18 | when a drive-thru is and isn't allowed and stuff.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7797.02)            |
|  7799.18 |  7805.18 | So that's what there's a lot of the zoning ordinance wants.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7799.18)            |
|  7805.18 |  7811.06 | So the reason that you have standards for drive-thrus is that they're designed to really                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7805.18)            |
|  7811.06 |  7817.94 | eliminate undesirable pollution that crosses lot boundaries.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7811.06)            |

|  7869.86 |  7874.54 | standards are kind of on the floor and nonexistent, and we're asking to raise them to help with                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7869.86)            |

|  7881.94 |  7883.74 | think of in the county.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7881.9400000000005) |
|  7883.74 |  7887.54 | Some are developed in zones that might be shopping center or PC, and those have some                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7883.74)            |
|  7887.54 |  7889.82 | more landscaping and stuff around them.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7887.54)            |
|  7889.82 |  7894.3  | But I noticed in Hardin Valley, right in the heart, Hardin Valley and Steel Road, you have                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7889.820000000001)  |
|  7894.3  |  7898.9  | a food city, and I looked, and that one's developed to the CA zone, which has no landscaping                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7894.3)             |
|  7898.9  |  7905.22 | standard, and that food city has not a single bit of landscaping anywhere on the property.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=7898.900000000001)  |

|  8976.06 |  8983.06 | What this is, is these are the bonds to fund the projects you approved in the FY23 capital                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8976.06)            |

|  8987.06 |  8994.06 | And the amount that you all approved was $69,985,000.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8987.06)            |
|  8994.06 |  8998.06 | We just round up to $70,000, which you see on the second resolution.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8994.06)            |
|  8999.02 |  9006.02 | The first resolution has the number 80 on it, because it is anticipating that we will                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=8999.019999999999)  |
|  9006.02 |  9011.02 | get some sort of bond premium when we go to market, and that's what has to go in the paper                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9006.019999999999)  |

|  9013.02 |  9016.02 | So the state requires the first resolution.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9013.019999999999)  |
|  9016.02 |  9020.02 | The second one's more of a detailed resolution.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9016.019999999999)  |
|  9020.02 |  9025.02 | They're both the same issue, although one's a different amount, because it includes a                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9020.019999999999)  |

|  9477.58 |  9480.58 | year, it's going to stay where it's at, it just depends on if the property assessor's                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9477.58)            |
|  9480.58 |  9484.1  | office does a reappraisal and it goes up or down, or if there's any tax increase or anything                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9480.58)            |
|  9484.1  |  9485.1  | like that.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9484.1)             |
|  9485.1  |  9486.1  | Director Caldwell could also probably help.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9485.1)             |
|  9486.1  |  9487.1  | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9486.1)             |
|  9487.1  |  9488.1  | Chris?                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9487.1)             |
|  9488.1  |  9491.74 | Wait, I didn't, it was hard to hear, I'm sorry.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9488.1)             |
|  9491.74 |  9496.82 | So is there, is there not, you're saying there's not going to be a fiscal impact?                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9491.74)            |
|  9496.82 |  9501.46 | There will be, depending on later use, whenever there, if there's a reappraisal, if there's                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9496.82)            |
|  9501.46 |  9505.78 | specific instances that take care, take course through county commission as well.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9501.46)            |
|  9505.78 |  9509.34 | Okay, and the fiscal note.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9505.779999999999)  |
|  9509.34 |  9515.46 | So technically, until there's a reappraisal, there is no lost revenue.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9509.34)            |
|  9515.46 |  9521.3  | And so you lose money during reappraisal, because those values go up, and you lock it                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9515.46)            |
|  9521.3  |  9525.94 | in a certain, so you really don't truly know, because you don't know what the value's going                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9521.3)             |
|  9526.06 |  9527.06 | to be.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9526.060000000001)  |
|  9527.06 |  9528.06 | Right?                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9527.060000000001)  |
|  9528.06 |  9529.06 | No, I understand that.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9528.060000000001)  |
|  9529.06 |  9538.74 | I guess I, in doing this, did somebody do some sort of calculation to say, of 4789 seniors,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9529.060000000001)  |
|  9538.74 |  9543.82 | currently there's an average value of X on their price, and look at the last reappraisal                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9538.74)            |
|  9543.82 |  9550.06 | to kind of, I mean, ultimately this will be, you know, what will it, we average, not to                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9543.82)            |
|  9550.06 |  9553.74 | say it's not a good program, but you know, this is the first thing that's had a fiscal                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9550.060000000001)  |
|  9553.74 |  9555.7  | impact that doesn't have a fiscal note attached.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9553.74)            |
|  9555.7  |  9560.5  | So I'm trying to just better understand, when you add 5,000 more people, what will that                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9555.699999999999)  |
|  9560.5  |  9565.62 | look like to generate, you know, or to take in less tax collection?                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9560.5)             |
|  9565.62 |  9569.78 | So I'm just wondering if anybody did that calculation, or trying to just do a broad                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9565.619999999999)  |
|  9569.78 |  9570.78 | estimate.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9569.78)            |
|  9570.78 |  9575.02 | What, what we could do is we could get the numbers crunched in my office, and this is                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9570.78)            |
|  9575.02 |  9578.7  | going to sound bad, but unfortunately some of these elderly people will be passing away,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9575.02)            |
|  9578.7  |  9583.06 | and whenever something like that does happen, it goes back and reverts back to the original                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9578.699999999999)  |
|  9583.38 |  9586.82 | status, and then the tax freeze is no longer applicable to the property.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9583.38)            |
|  9586.82 |  9592.18 | So it's for the property that that person is now, if someone goes into assisted living                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9586.82)            |
|  9592.18 |  9596.94 | or a retirement home, obviously it will no longer be attached to that property as well.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9592.18)            |
|  9596.94 |  9600.7  | So as soon as it ends up a new owner, it goes back on the tax rate as full value.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9596.939999999999)  |
|  9600.7  |  9601.7  | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9600.699999999999)  |
|  9601.7  |  9602.7  | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9601.699999999999)  |
|  9602.7  |  9609.9  | And one thing to keep in mind, too, Commissioners, you know, the income level is pretty low,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9602.699999999999)  |
|  9609.9  |  9617.7  | so we're not collecting a whole lot of property tax per individual or family on this for sure.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9609.9)             |
|  9617.7  |  9618.7  | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9617.699999999999)  |

|  9619.7  |  9620.7  | Right.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9619.699999999999)  |
|  9620.7  |  9624.18 | Well, I don't think they're going to be able to afford a whole lot for, you know.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9620.699999999999)  |
|  9624.18 |  9626.5  | It's just, you know, something to think through down the road.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9624.18)            |
|  9626.5  |  9631.02 | But if you could, I mean, this isn't an actuarial table, just like we do in a retirement thing                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9626.5)             |

|  9634.34 |  9636.82 | Just trying to get a better sense of this, just to note.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9634.34)            |
|  9636.86 |  9639.54 | I do think it's a good program, and I'm happy to support it.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9636.86)            |
|  9639.54 |  9643.54 | I just wanted to, if you can start thinking about what that list is going to look like,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9639.539999999999)  |
|  9643.54 |  9649.14 | I guess, four years from now, three, I'm assuming that would be four, depending on if they did it.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9643.539999999999)  |
|  9649.14 |  9650.14 | That would be interesting.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9649.14)            |
|  9650.14 |  9655.98 | I do find it interesting just that, like, that this resolution is actually, specifically                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9650.14)            |

|  9665.38 |  9668.74 | So, it's, we don't talk about that with budgetary.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9665.380000000001)  |

|  9671.62 |  9676.62 | We're literally about to pass a resolution that says, we recognize that since 2007, your                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9671.62)            |

|  9903.62 |  9906.1  | up with this, if he wants to clarify anything or not.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9903.62)            |
|  9906.1  |  9912.1  | Well, it just comes out of our discussion at the retreat. The Education Consent Calendar                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9906.1)             |
|  9912.1  |  9918.38 | came about because of some conflicts between the way the Commission, the old Commission,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9912.1)             |
|  9918.38 |  9925.82 | was handling school board matters. Basically, under state law, once you have budgeted funds                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9918.380000000001)  |
|  9925.82 |  9929.86 | to the school board, it's up to the school board to decide how to spend those funds as                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9925.82)            |
|  9929.86 |  9936.42 | long as they don't cross major budgetary categories. Therefore, there's not, there's really no                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9929.86)            |
|  9936.42 |  9941.66 | power of this Commission to affect that. The only reason we have these items on the Agenda                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9936.42)            |

| 10568.7  | 10576.7  | CA and CB zoning for years with no regulations. It's not rocket science. You know, Chick-fil-A                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10568.66)           |
| 10576.7  | 10586.7  | or McDonald's or Starbucks or whatever, there's, and those guys know drive-throughs, especially,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10576.66)           |
| 10586.7  | 10593.7  | say, Chick-fil-A, better than any of us. They've hired all the best engineers and architects                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10586.66)           |
| 10593.7  | 10598.7  | in the world, and they know how to do their drive-throughs. And so I would hate to think                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10593.66)           |
| 10598.7  | 10603.7  | that we get in the way of them doing what they know how to do. Secondly, I don't recall                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10598.66)           |
| 10603.7  | 10610.7  | this body really debating drive-throughs over the years. I've been developing for 40 years                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10603.66)           |
| 10610.7  | 10616.7  | now. I don't remember this being some big problem, and so are we over-regulating something                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10610.66)           |
| 10616.7  | 10623.7  | that just naturally takes, you know, makes sense? And we all know we wouldn't be here                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10616.66)           |
| 10623.7  | 10628.7  | today without drive-throughs getting through COVID. You know, if it wasn't for drive-throughs,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10623.66)           |
| 10628.7  | 10638.7  | we would really be in up the creek. And so I would just say that this is more government                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10628.66)           |
| 10638.7  | 10647.7  | and not less government. And so that's just kind of generally the comments that we have.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10638.66)           |
| 10647.7  | 10655.7  | Globally, on the red line document, I think we just wanted to address that McDonald's                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10647.66)           |
| 10655.7  | 10660.7  | doesn't have a problem with Chick-fil-A's drive-through, or if they're located next                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10655.66)           |
| 10660.7  | 10667.7  | to industrial use or even a multifamily use. You don't have any debate. I think the biggest                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10660.66)           |
| 10667.7  | 10674.7  | issue is, does it affect a single-family home? And so we made that proposed carve-out                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10667.66)           |
| 10674.7  | 10682.7  | in the document that you have that these standards would come into play if you are adjoining,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10674.66)           |
| 10682.7  | 10689.7  | if a commercial lot is adjoining a single-family home. You know, in all the property that we                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10682.66)           |
| 10690.7  | 10698.7  | own in the centers, I've never had old Charlies complain about Chick-fil-A or whatever. And                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10690.66)           |
| 10698.7  | 10706.7  | so we just don't see that as being necessary. One of my most recent developments out in                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10698.66)           |
| 10706.7  | 10710.7  | front of our target, you know, we spent six or eight months getting through a use-only                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10706.66)           |
| 10710.7  | 10717.7  | review because it had a drive-through. And so at the end of the day, it ended up being                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10710.66)           |
| 10717.7  | 10728.7  | what we proposed originally. So, you know, the issues that I saw that the staff, which                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10717.66)           |
| 10728.7  | 10735.7  | was the noise, lighting, and a buffer is needed when you do have these standards, when you                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10728.66)           |
| 10735.7  | 10742.7  | are next to, say, a single-family residence. So we've tweaked on those some. Be glad to                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10735.66)           |
| 10742.7  | 10751.7  | answer any questions or discuss any parts of it.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10742.66)           |
| 10751.7  | 10758.7  | Thank you. Thank you for that. I do believe since this red line has occurred that it also                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10751.66)           |
| 10758.7  | 10768.7  | has, I know that I sent a copy to Mr. Stone and also to Knox Planning. Jim, would you                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10758.66)           |
| 10768.7  | 10774.7  | come forward? Do you have any comments, suggestions, or recommendations on this that you feel like                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10768.66)           |
| 10774.7  | 10776.7  | are appropriate?                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10774.66)           |
| 10776.7  | 10782.7  | Yeah, and I would, from my perspective, being the party that has to enforce these standards,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10776.66)           |
| 10782.7  | 10788.7  | I think I need to be pretty neutral in this matter and not really take an opinion one                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10782.66)           |
| 10788.7  | 10794.7  | way or the other in regard to the Planning Advocates' comments or Mr. Graham's comments.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10788.66)           |
| 10794.7  | 10804.7  | I would say that if this body wanted to consider Mr. Graham's suggestions, that I would recommend                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10794.66)           |
| 10804.7  | 10812.7  | it. Those changes are pretty significant, so I think that might require that red line                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10804.66)           |
| 10812.7  | 10818.7  | to go back to Planning Commission. But as far as my opinion in regard to the different                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10812.66)           |
| 10818.7  | 10824.7  | comments, I would be hesitant to offer really any, just because my department does have                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10818.66)           |
| 10824.7  | 10828.7  | to enforce the standards. I don't think it would really be appropriate for me to offer                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10824.66)           |
| 10828.7  | 10829.7  | that.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10828.66)           |
| 10829.7  | 10837.7  | All right. All right. Thank you. One discussion that I do believe occurred, and I think, Tim,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10829.66)           |

| 10844.7  | 10852.7  | the concern that was presented was it was like a who is here first that you might address                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10844.66)           |
| 10852.7  | 10860.7  | and perhaps if you wanted to consider any change along that regard as far as having                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10852.66)           |
| 10860.7  | 10865.7  | a single family lot next to you as opposed to...                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10860.66)           |
| 10865.7  | 10874.7  | Sure. And that's probably a reasonable request that maybe a platted lot that's part of a                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10865.66)           |

| 10912.7  | 10917.7  | Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to first thank planning staff. I don't know if they're still                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10912.66)           |
| 10917.7  | 10922.7  | here and also engineering. You know, a lot of time and effort and work went into this.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10917.66)           |
| 10922.7  | 10928.7  | As Mr. Murphy stated, a little bit of background. This came out of conversations when the John                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10922.66)           |
| 10928.7  | 10936.7  | Sevier Highway Corridor Study was conducted and we were looking at providing developers                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10928.66)           |
| 10936.7  | 10943.7  | with more uses for commercial properties. And in that discussion, we acknowledged that                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10936.66)           |
| 10943.7  | 10949.7  | we had not really looked at drive-thrus. And one thing to consider is with the recommendations                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10943.66)           |
| 10949.7  | 10957.7  | coming out of advanced NOCs, we will see probably more recommendations and suggestions for mixed                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10949.66)           |
| 10957.7  | 10963.7  | use and town centers. And so this is something that will be on our radar. I'm sure we'll                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10957.66)           |
| 10963.7  | 10971.7  | have to look at some of these uses. And so it's important to have something in place.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10963.66)           |
| 10971.7  | 10975.7  | You know, I had a lovely conversation with Mr. Graham. I understand his concerns and                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10971.66)           |
| 10975.7  | 10980.7  | his comments. I told him, you know, you're kind of coming in at the 11th hour. We've                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10975.66)           |
| 10980.7  | 10985.7  | been talking about this for like four months. And he explained to me he had been traveling                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10980.66)           |
| 10985.7  | 10991.7  | and out of town. And so what I'm willing to do, and I hope the body is willing to do,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10985.66)           |
| 10991.7  | 11000.7  | is to send this back to planning and have a conversation that includes Mr. Graham, Mr.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10991.66)           |
| 11000.7  | 11006.7  | Murphy, engineering, planning, and myself. Because, you know, we like to say we're not                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11000.66)           |
| 11006.7  | 11010.7  | married to things. I'm kind of married to this. I mean, I was, you know, a part of this                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11006.66)           |
| 11010.7  | 11016.7  | effort. And so I think it's important. I don't want to minimize it. I don't want to water                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11010.66)           |

| 11023.7  | 11028.7  | know, I think that's where we are now. Again, I want to remind everyone, this went through                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11023.66)           |

| 11126.7  | 11129.7  | So you're saying it's agricultural versus...                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11126.66)           |
| 11129.7  | 11134.7  | Well, it doesn't matter. It could be RA, it could be whatever. Well, RA would...                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11129.66)           |
| 11134.7  | 11143.7  | Well, we were strictly thinking about residential, i.e. multifamily, when we changed it from                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11134.66)           |

| 11157.7  | 11159.7  | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11157.66)           |
| 11159.7  | 11165.7  | Your question is a legitimate question and probably should be addressed.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11159.66)           |

| 11202.7  | 11209.7  | We were talking about that today in our CODES meeting, and historically,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11202.66)           |
| 11209.7  | 11213.7  | we haven't had a lot of complaints from drive-thrus.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11209.66)           |
| 11213.7  | 11216.7  | We do get complaints about light trespass and noise,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11213.66)           |
| 11216.7  | 11222.7  | but historically, they've not been really voluminous from a drive-thru.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11216.66)           |

| 11238.7  | 11242.7  | I just didn't want to get into over-regulation.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11238.66)           |
| 11242.7  | 11248.7  | If there's not a need, why would we do that, absent there being a problem?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11242.66)           |

| 11254.7  | 11256.7  | This is a question for Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11254.66)           |
| 11256.7  | 11260.7  | What would be sent back or sent back to commission planning,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11256.66)           |
| 11260.7  | 11264.7  | the most recent red line or the original or both?                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11260.66)           |
| 11264.7  | 11267.7  | And what are we asking of?                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11264.66)           |
| 11267.7  | 11269.7  | Commissioner Frazier?                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11267.66)           |
| 11269.7  | 11271.7  | Thank you, Commissioner Jay, for the question.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11269.66)           |
| 11271.7  | 11280.7  | We would send back the current version that you all have already approved on first reading,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11271.66)           |
| 11280.7  | 11288.7  | and then we would take into consideration the comments and concerns of Mr. Graham                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11280.66)           |
| 11288.7  | 11292.7  | to possibly then present back to planning commission.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11288.66)           |
| 11292.7  | 11299.7  | So we're sending them both versions and saying, look, here's current and suggestion.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11292.66)           |
| 11299.7  | 11300.7  | Right, right.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11299.66)           |
| 11300.7  | 11303.7  | Go through the process and figure out how to either meld the two                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11300.66)           |
| 11303.7  | 11306.7  | or send us back something that's a combination.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11303.66)           |
| 11306.7  | 11307.7  | Right.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11306.66)           |
| 11307.7  | 11310.7  | And they could say, we're fine with it as written.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11307.66)           |
| 11310.7  | 11314.7  | And so we just, as a courtesy, we're sending it back                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11310.66)           |
| 11314.7  | 11318.7  | so we can take into consideration his concerns and comments.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11314.66)           |
| 11318.7  | 11319.7  | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11318.66)           |
| 11319.7  | 11322.7  | I think as long as both are sent back and we don't start from scratch.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11319.66)           |
| 11322.7  | 11323.7  | Right.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11322.66)           |
| 11323.7  | 11324.7  | No, no, no.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11323.66)           |

| 11352.7  | 11357.7  | This came about the Alcoa Highway Corridor study, which was business.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11352.66)           |
| 11357.7  | 11364.7  | When all the neighbors got together and had probably five, six meetings,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11357.66)           |
| 11364.7  | 11367.7  | Mr. Snowden probably didn't get any phone calls,                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11364.66)           |
| 11367.7  | 11374.7  | but there at the Hardee's that is closed down, they had a loudspeaker,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11367.66)           |
| 11374.7  | 11377.7  | and I got phone calls from that neighbor.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11374.66)           |
| 11377.7  | 11380.7  | I mean, they were right there.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11377.66)           |
| 11380.7  | 11383.7  | So, yeah, was there issues?                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11380.66)           |
| 11383.7  | 11387.7  | Nothing major, but, yeah, you're living there                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11383.66)           |
| 11387.7  | 11398.7  | and you hear Hardee's loudspeakers at 11 o'clock at night for giving me the Hardee's Jr. or whatever.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11387.66)           |
| 11398.7  | 11405.7  | Yeah, it is not a major problem, but it was a problem to those neighbors around Alcoa Highway.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11398.66)           |
| 11405.7  | 11411.7  | And we can fix that by the noise level, DBAs, which Mr. Graham has already suggested.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11405.66)           |
| 11411.7  | 11416.7  | So that was, I wanted to say that.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11411.66)           |
| 11416.7  | 11417.7  | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11416.66)           |
| 11417.7  | 11421.7  | Any more discussion regarding this item?                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11417.66)           |
| 11421.7  | 11428.7  | Well, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11421.66)           |
| 11428.7  | 11432.7  | So, Commissioner Daley?                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11428.66)           |
| 11432.7  | 11436.7  | That was by Commissioner Frazier with a second by Commissioner Ward.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11432.66)           |
| 11436.7  | 11442.7  | Move forward with no recommendation.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11436.66)           |
| 11442.7  | 11446.7  | It has to go.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11442.66)           |
| 11446.7  | 11451.7  | So, seeing there's no more discussion, all those in favor say aye.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11446.66)           |
| 11451.7  | 11453.7  | Any opposed?                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11451.66)           |
| 11453.7  | 11457.7  | That motion carries.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11453.66)           |
| 11457.7  | 11460.7  | That moves us to public forum on open topics.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11457.66)           |

| 11499.7  | 11511.7  | Let's back up to Sheriff Spangler's video where he showed his officer getting assaulted in the pod.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11499.66)           |

| 11516.7  | 11526.7  | That being the psychiatric pod, what happens is you get a lot of people in there that's medicated through Helen Ross Benal.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11516.66)           |
| 11526.7  | 11532.7  | And once they get behind them bars, they don't get their medication.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11526.66)           |

| 11758.7  | 11760.7  | So I'll be glad to tell you the numbers as we get to them.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11758.66)           |
| 11760.7  | 11768.7  | But if there's nothing relevant, then we can just just say nothing relevant.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11760.66)           |
| 11768.7  | 11779.7  | So we're talking about number sixty two and sixty three.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11768.66)           |
| 11779.7  | 11787.7  | Commissioner Hill, would you like to make any comment regarding yours on sixty two and sixty three?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11779.66)           |
| 11787.7  | 11789.7  | These are district six.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11787.66)           |
| 11789.7  | 11795.7  | They really should be yours because the lines are good.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11789.66)           |
| 11795.7  | 11796.7  | All right.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11795.66)           |
| 11796.7  | 11802.7  | Because they are right on the property line of the township.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11796.66)           |
| 11802.7  | 11805.7  | Farragut.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11802.66)           |
| 11805.7  | 11806.7  | I know that.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11805.66)           |
| 11806.7  | 11809.7  | And really, this just can make.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11806.66)           |
| 11809.7  | 11811.7  | I will let you address this.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11809.66)           |
| 11811.7  | 11814.7  | I know that they have some very real concerns.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11811.66)           |
| 11814.7  | 11825.7  | Part of this does not really coincide with what the township of Farragut would desire.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11814.66)           |
| 11825.7  | 11829.7  | There is density around it that is equal to it.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11825.66)           |
| 11829.7  | 11834.7  | There's also density around it that is considerably less.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11829.66)           |
| 11834.7  | 11844.7  | So it's they they've looked at the road improvements.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11834.66)           |
| 11844.7  | 11856.7  | Road improvements that we deal with seem to coincide with as fast as we can get a road improvement planned or even on the books.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11844.66)           |
| 11856.7  | 11865.7  | Then immediately the development starts and then the planned road improvements justify development.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11856.66)           |
| 11865.7  | 11871.7  | So I certainly understand both sides of that equation, too.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11865.66)           |
| 11871.7  | 11877.7  | But Mr. Schoonmaker, do you have anything you want to add?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11871.66)           |
| 11877.7  | 11883.7  | As I said, I know this is your your Farragut town that's taking it very personal.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11877.66)           |
| 11883.7  | 11885.7  | Yeah, I do think they did.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11883.66)           |
| 11885.7  | 11891.7  | Their administration sent a letter to Knox, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11885.66)           |
| 11891.7  | 11896.7  | I don't know if Amy remembers that or what.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11891.66)           |
| 11896.7  | 11902.7  | But anyways, yeah, they're just concerned about it backing up to the town of Farragut limits.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11896.66)           |
| 11902.7  | 11904.7  | And that letter, by the way, was never posted.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11902.66)           |
| 11904.7  | 11914.7  | So since it wasn't addressed to me, even though it's in my district, I think that's a little bit of a yeah.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11904.66)           |
| 11914.7  | 11917.7  | Because they figured laundry also.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11914.66)           |
| 11917.7  | 11925.7  | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11917.66)           |
| 11925.7  | 11926.7  | OK.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11925.66)           |
| 11926.7  | 11928.7  | Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11926.66)           |
| 11928.7  | 11929.7  | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11928.66)           |
| 11929.7  | 11937.7  | Just to that point, I did reach out to the town of Farragut because if you will notice under the GDP, it does state that this is the Farragut urban growth boundary.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11929.66)           |
| 11937.7  | 11945.7  | And any time we have something like that on our zoning agenda, I try to be a good neighbor, good steward and reach out to them.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11937.66)           |

| 12124.7  | 12132.7  | I do have some opposition from members in the community that think that's too much for the traffic and density.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12124.66)           |

| 12175.7  | 12179.7  | So there's a lot of opposition.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12175.66)           |
| 12179.7  | 12181.7  | And the density.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12179.66)           |
| 12181.7  | 12184.7  | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12181.66)           |

| 12188.7  | 12193.7  | If there's one lady that not in her backyard.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12188.66)           |
| 12193.7  | 12196.7  | Besides that, he's already approved for eight.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12193.66)           |
| 12196.7  | 12198.7  | They want 12.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12196.66)           |
| 12198.7  | 12202.7  | And from my talks with everybody, it's not going to affect the traffic flow.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12198.66)           |
| 12202.7  | 12205.7  | It's on a railroad track on a main artery.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12202.66)           |
| 12205.7  | 12211.7  | It's on Westland, which is the main artery that goes out to both our four lane roads.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12205.66)           |
| 12211.7  | 12220.7  | So I don't particularly have any issue with it since it's the traffic studies suggested there's not going to be any change going from eight to 12.                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12211.66)           |
| 12220.7  | 12222.7  | And it's already approved for eight.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12220.66)           |
| 12222.7  | 12227.7  | So as long as the traffic study supports that, I don't really have an issue with it.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12222.66)           |
| 12227.7  | 12230.7  | So you said the traffic study supports the 12.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12227.66)           |
| 12230.7  | 12234.7  | From what I was told that the traffic study says going eight to 12 is not going to affect anything.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12230.66)           |
| 12234.7  | 12239.7  | And Mr. Snowden can talk to that planning or at next week's thing.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12234.66)           |
| 12239.7  | 12248.7  | But what I was told that the traffic study suggested it was not going to affect anything is in significance.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12239.66)           |
| 12248.7  | 12255.7  | And also Crescent Ridge just got Crescent Apartments just got built down the street, which is like massive apartment complex.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12248.66)           |

| 12280.7  | 12284.7  | And the developer is buying like three parcels and putting them together.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12280.66)           |

| 12288.7  | 12293.7  | I think he has a contract on other parcels.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12288.66)           |
| 12293.7  | 12296.7  | But I don't know if he's buying them together.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12293.66)           |
