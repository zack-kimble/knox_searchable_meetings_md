| 0:00:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=14)|

| 0:00:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| We have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Commissioner Anders and I would like to put a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| We'll get it for next week with the Powell High School football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| We'd like to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| Commissioner Shouse is not here, but he has that a resolution be added with regards to the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| So on his behalf, I'll ask that that be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| Are there any other items to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Did I preempt a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Commissioner Shouse's resolution would be 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| There is a resolution R11-1210 we're adding, sir, because the state of Tennessee recently changed the name of judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=70)|
| 0:01:20| commissioners to using the term magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| So that's more ministerial, but we have that change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| You know, and I don't know whose district this lies in, but it really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| But what Commissioner Smith was saying out there, it's really nice to do about Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| We probably need to form one for the Christian Academy of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| I think they won a championship in the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| I think it's district four and five, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Is that five or four out there, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Is CAK yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| CAK is in the Commissioner Norman's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Are these resolutions to honor schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Because if they are, kindly send me the information so we can draft them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Yes, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| I have just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| I didn't get that 904 that's commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| It should be in front of you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| It was just handed out right before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| It was handed out this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| I just learned about it Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| On this side, I don't think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Here's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Jill, do you have other copies of 904?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| I can hand those out to you if you didn't get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Is that mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| They're two-sided, so that may throw you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| That's yours, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| I would be glad to offer explanation if you really --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| I'm sorry if it appears to be sprung at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| I thought about this a week or two, and then we had a lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| We, the audit committee, had a lunch with Ryan Haines, a legislative delegation head, a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| Maybe just a little over a week ago, and I discussed it with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Of course, he was noncommittal, so he's got a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| I'm sure he's getting pressure from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| This is leaving the Sunshine Law as it is or liberalizing it, meaning liberalizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| the liberalization of it meaning up to a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Like, I guess that six of us could meet in a room and decide what to do and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| And there's some push in Nashville, a lot of push, really, from various county commissions around the state to open this thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| And I just thought Knoxville or Knox County being the epicenter of the violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| the greatest violations of the Sunshine Law and encroachments of it that I'm aware of, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| that I wanted to make the position of the county commission known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| I may be in a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Obviously, I haven't consulted with any of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| But I think we need to leave the Sunshine Law as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| I can understand the how it appears to not be inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Well, government often is inherently inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| But I can understand the, from some perspectives, how, well, let's don't, let's be able to conduct business in private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=229)|
| 0:03:59| and we can get more done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| But I disagree with that philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| And I wanted to state that the Knox County Commission stands, as far as where it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| is that leaving the Sunshine Law as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Sort of dovetailing on the Sunshine Law, the resolution that was passed by commission last regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| Has that been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| I do not know that I have seen that in writing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| The resolution with regards to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| The new rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| The 48-hour rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Is that in print yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| There's a lot of other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Has the rules been changed based on last month's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Julie says she's working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Without, if it's okay with you, I'd like to move the Judicial Commissioner up to after the reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| or consent items because Judge Stansbury is here and I want to get him back into the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| And if there's no, if no one has any objection to that, I'd like to move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| We have one more resolution, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| Commissioner Owenby has crafted a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Under the rules, if you have a stated conflict of interest, which Commissioner Owenby will disclose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| you really can't be involved in either the discussion nor the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| But our rules are silent as to actually just putting forth a resolution but not commenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| or involving themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| So, in abundance of caution, I'd just like to submit to you Resolution L-12902 to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| So, do we hear a motion that everything need to be added, added, deleted, deleted, changed, changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| So we can set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| I have a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| On what the law director just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| And, again, just for just protection, everyone, should you then be the one that says requested by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| Should we, you know, in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Certainly, no problem at all putting that by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| And we can amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| That will be a clean copy next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| But beyond that, it will be up to a commissioner to actually bring it up for a vote and then discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| I will be happy to do that if we need someone's name on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| I'm going to say, reading over it, yeah, when it comes up, we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| But, yeah, I'd be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| We have two co-sponsors and we'll just do that instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| We'll change it to those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| So we have a motion to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Next is the approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| I have a sample consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Feel free to take anything off that you would like to take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Number 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=414)|
| 0:07:23| 19, 20, 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| Would anyone like to remove anything from that proposed consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| If not, do I have a motion that those items be approved on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Can I look just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=464)|
| 0:08:14| Have you had adequate time to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=494)|
| 0:08:25| Does anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| So do I hear a motion that those items be placed on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I had mentioned the judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| It looks like that would have been the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| So, Judge Stansbury, would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Before we begin the interview process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| I want to make sure that we're all on the same page with regards to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| And, first of all, Judge, thank you and your colleagues for communicating with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| and sending us all the pertinent information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| I think we've got some outstanding candidates with which to interview and to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| But would you explain to us the process that you're going to be using because by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| you'll be presenting us with some recommendations at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| So in April of 2009, this body passed a resolution that required the session's judges to send a list of not less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| than four or more than eight people to recommend given the number of applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| should there be a position open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So we're in the process of compiling that list, and we will get that to you prior to the vote on Monday, the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Do you have any questions for the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| So we have 15 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| 15, you would recommend eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| You will call it down to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| That's the way we read the resolution that was passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| I would defer to the law director if he reads it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| No, sir, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Judge, what are some key issues that we need to be looking at, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| as these candidates come up before us, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| I mean, I'll have practiced in sessions court some longer than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| The resumes are pretty well thought out, well received, and appropriate for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| Some have substituted for other judicial commissioners or for Commissioner Jeter after she passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=614)|
| 0:10:23| I think that's just an individual decision that each commissioner would have to make, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| We appreciate you taking the lead on that and giving us guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Judge, does your group of judges also approve the substitute judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| Because I know several looking through these resumes, several of these have already substituted as a magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| It's more of an informal process by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| I believe an interest is expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| And Richard Major is the supervisor of the judicial commissioners, magistrates now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| And we consult with him, whoever the presiding judge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And we stay in close contact relative to who is substituting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| So just to be clear, even though you will be presenting us with eight recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| the commission can follow that or they can select someone else from the people who have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| The way that we read the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Well, if you read the 09 resolution in conjunction with the applicable state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| the state law states and I think it's pretty clear that you all appoint and we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| or decline to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| That was affected by the 09 resolution that you all passed so that we have to submit something prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| Mr. Law Director, if you would just weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| So when we get the list of eight, will we be pretty much required, I guess the word is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| to select from the eight that are given to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| That's the way the statute is crafted, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| So the interview process today is just as important for you as it is for us, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| I think the judges have a good feel for everybody that has applied as to their strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Does anyone else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| We have some individuals who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| We got a word from a couple of individuals who could not be here today because they're out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| and doing other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| But we have 15 people who have applied for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| and we want to give each of them an opportunity to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| We'd like to ask you to hold it to three minutes, up to three minutes, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| And we will just go in the order that we have them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I believe this is alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| First, Alexander Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Is Alexander Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Mr. Brown, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| And you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Yes, I'm Alexander Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| My address is 7450 Chapman Highway, number 241.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| That's Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| And in my resume states, I had previously set in as a substitute, as the judge referred to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=792)|
| 0:13:23| substituted for some of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| It's my practice has primarily been criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| I've probably 90% of my practice is criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| So it's I feel very comfortable with the requirements of this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| what it would take as far as approving, whether it's search warrants, finding a probable cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| whatever would be necessary for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| I've got about ten years' experience in dealing with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| On the defense side, as well as having served in the position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Questions for Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Mr. Brown, no relation, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| The question asked a while ago about the substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| From what I understand, there's been a lot of changes made in the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| I know some of you all who have applied are substituting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Some of them it's been six, seven, eight years since they have substituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| Are you substituting currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| And the reason I'm not is several years ago one of the district attorneys brought down an opinion from the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| stating that people practicing criminal defense couldn't practice as a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| And I was, I don't know if it was a good decision or not, but I felt it necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| I called the Board myself and asked for an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| The opinion they gave me was that I couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Our judges here don't agree with that, and they have, and I think they're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| But because I had already requested an opinion from the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I felt it necessary to stop doing that and practicing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| So what you're saying is that anybody who's practicing criminal defense should be disqualified in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| Judge Stansbury, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| No, that's not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| Well, they've got to give up their practice to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| I misstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Is that your understanding, Judge Stansbury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| Because that could have a bearing on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| I know some of them are practicing criminally now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Let me get my glasses out and I'll read you an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| We sought an opinion from, at the time, the presiding judge of the Court of the Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| And I don't know if you all had this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| It was addressed to the Knox County General Sessions Court judges dated January the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| It basically details that we have asked for an opinion as to whether Knox County magistrates may maintain a law practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| in addition to serving in the appointed position of old judicial commissioner, now judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| They serve on a rotating basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| I interpret part-time judges being those who devote fewer than 40 hours per week to their judicial duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| and by their schedules have time during normal working hours to practice law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Those selecting the magistrates may require that they end their practices of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| but I understand that this has not been the practice in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Further, I should add that part-time judges must make certain that their law practices do not interfere with their judicial duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| And at the time, Allen Glenn was on the Court of Criminal Appeals and was the presiding judge for the Court of the Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| That's a rotating position, meaning it's moved on a periodic basis between the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| but I don't know who is the current presiding judge on the Court of the Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| So according to that, under our understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| that we have allowed the positions and the persons that are serving to make their own decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| We have not told them to practice law or not practice law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| Mr. Law Director, are we going to get in problems if we —I could see it maybe for a substitute that wouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| as long as, you know, they're not involved in that particular case or cases that come up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| But for a full-time magistrate, are we going to get in problems if a person has a full-time criminal defense practice also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1067)|
| 0:18:00| Well, it is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I mean, you presume to think that the position requires you to work with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| and to make decisions as to warrants, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| But I would like to see the opinion that Judge Stansbury reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| I could comment on that, you know, more intelligently if I actually have it in front of me and have a chance to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| So the way it stands right now to be on the safe side, whoever is appointed to this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| if they're a criminal defense attorney, they need to drop that law practice while they're in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| That would be my take on it, sir, yes, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Quick question, Judge, while you're there and for the people at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Just tell us again real quick in layman's terms what this judicial commissioner does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| what kind of salary they make, what kind of hours that they keep, just so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| There's a schedule that I have copied and put in your information packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| I can give you what I have as far as the fact sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Give me just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1138)|
| 0:19:11| Commissioner Jeter made an annual salary of $64,899.42 plus benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| Her term began on February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| I believe it was to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Of course, the county commission is free to do as they will as to appointing a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| I think it's not less than one but not more than four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Commissioner Jeter's term was to end in January of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| The duties include but are not necessarily limited to issuance of arrest warrants, search warrants, minimuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| The judicial commission may also issue forfeiture warrants and conduct all arraignments by means of video in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| The judicial commissioners have the duty of determining whether or not probable cause exists to issue an arrest warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| when a crime is alleged to have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| And given the facts of the case, they are then free to set a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| And how often do they work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| They work in weeks or months' time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| They work this person work how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I believe 37.5 hours, 36 hours a week, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| That's handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Could you come to the podium, please, and give us your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Richard Major, 11406 Oxford Station Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I'm the Chief Magistrate of the Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| To speak to the question that Commissioner Smith was asking, our average work week is a 36-hour work week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| That's a rotating schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| We work 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| We work three 12-hour shifts on, four 12-hour shifts off, and we rotate throughout positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Not every one of us works at any point in a 24-hour period during a given week, but it rotates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| And as to, if I could help to, the issue that Alex was talking about a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| there's a distinction here between someone who currently serves as a magistrate under the Code of Judicial Conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| may not practice criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| That's an absolute clear, bright-line rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| However, that does not apply to individuals who serve as substitute magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| That's what Alex was referring to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| So anyone who was interested in the position, I think they probably all understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| would have to end any criminal law practice that they have, but not a law practice in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, that was going to be my question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| And then the second one is going to be, as Mr. Major just said, are these considered part of full-time positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1292)|
| 0:21:43| I would think full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Okay, because that 36 hours, I didn't know if that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| So that is considered full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| And you can address that to Ms. Fogerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| but consistent with the county's human resources policy is, in fact, a full-time position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and benefits are structured based on being a full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| And that is certainly consistent with the 37-and-a-half-hour week that standard county employees work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| I'd like to point out that there's a divergence of opinion as to full-time and part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| given different references to the positions in the code and say such things as human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| and Ms. Fogerson's, you know, minimum 37.5 hours to be considered full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| So it's a little ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So it doesn't get different answers for different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| But no full-time judicial magistrate practices full-time criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| They can't practice criminal law, but they can maintain a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Ethically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| So that will, that is the understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Everyone understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Do you, and I would defer to the law director if he has a divergent or differing opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| No, Your Honor, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| And members of the commission, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| That's in our practice and that's what we believe the law to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| That avoids any potential conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Mr. Brown, thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| James Crane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| If you would give us your address for the record, please, Mr. Crane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| And you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| My name is James M. Crane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| My address is 9925 Coluzzi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| And for the benefit of most of you, I will spell that C-O-L-U-Z-Z-I Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1407)|
| 0:23:36| Actually, I'm not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| I'm still in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I've been practicing law since 1973.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| While I have done some criminal law, the majority of my work has been in the civil area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| I have previously served as a substitute judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I'm not currently serving primarily because no one has asked me to recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1437)|
| 0:24:08| I think that it is necessary to consider the importance of the judicial commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| the judicial magistrate's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| It is, in essence, a gatekeeper to determine that there is a reason to believe that a crime has been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1457)|
| 0:24:27| That counts for about 90 percent of their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Make sure that the charge does state a crime and that there is a factual basis for those charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1471)|
| 0:24:43| To fail to do so puts our citizens at risk of ill-advised or hasty actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| And the cost of criminal defense, even a successful criminal defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| or I would say particularly a successful criminal defense, is crippling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| Our citizens should not be exposed to that unless there's a basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| I am semi-retired, not practicing full-time at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| I do have one pending criminal case to which I was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| It is all over but the shouting, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| Complete resolution satisfactory both to the attorney general and to the defendant has been reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| and entered on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| There is one follow-up hearing to be held on January 12th, following which I should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| should have completed that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Now, I ask if you have any questions of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| I had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Is that since you're semi-retired and this is really a full-time job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| is this the type of thing you're willing to take on, you know, for the next several years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you, sir, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Dustin Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| My address is 9224 Topoco Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| That's T-O-P-O-C-O, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Yes, sir, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1593)|

| 0:26:36| My name is Dustin Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Yes, sir, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| My name is Dustin Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I'm a graduate of Bearden High School and a former Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I worked as an administrator in the Marine Corps and been practicing law for about a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| And during that time, I have been a substitute commissioner with the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| probably the primary substitute commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| I filled in for not only Ms. Jeter, but also Commissioner Brown and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| as they've had their things to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And over the last year, I've learned, you know, how to go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| how to make sure we have proper charges, the bonds and conditions that are correct to protect the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| once we've decided to charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And I have enjoyed getting to know the commissioners and the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| and the clerks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And I like working with them and would like to do so going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1666)|

| 0:28:05| I'm at 2919 Bowright, B-O-R-I-G-H-T Drive, and that's Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| And you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| I basically have been practicing criminal law for about two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| As a solo practitioner, 100 percent of my practice is criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| I am in the courts pretty much every day, sessions court or criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| I feel like I have a battle about probable cause all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Whether it's been met, I feel like I know what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I may not always agree with the commissioners when they think they have found probable cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| but that's kind of my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| I recognize, as one of my other candidates had mentioned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| this is a very important position because you're talking about just simply having charges on someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| can have a profound impact on their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| And it's not something that you want to make too difficult because you want to protect the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| but you also don't want to make it too easy because you don't want a spurious accusation turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| into something that really has the ability to disrupt someone's life in a profound way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| You want to make sure that there's a basis for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| and I think that's what the commissioner's main job is, is to look at the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| decide whether or not they think that it's a valid concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| and if it is, then go forward and set bonds that are appropriate to see that the person comes to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| and to keep the public safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I have no doubt whatsoever that I could handle this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| and I recognize it would mean giving up my criminal practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| but it's something I would be willing to do to accept this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Do you have any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Have you subbed before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I have not subbed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you very much for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Matthew Hollingshead Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you will have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Matthew Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| My address is 5706 Fall Creek Lane, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| thank you for allowing me this brief opportunity to address my qualifications for the position of judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| There are four areas of my background that I believe make me very well qualified for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| First, ties to the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I was born at St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| I'm a graduate of Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I spent nearly eight years as an officer with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| which included working in about every part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Almost my entire life, I've resided in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Second, public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Almost all of my adult life has included some aspect of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| The day before my 19th birthday, I joined the Tennessee Army National Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| and went to basic training in Fort McClellan, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| As I mentioned earlier, I spent nearly eight years as an officer with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1871)|
| 0:31:21| For the last two years, I've served as a substitute judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Despite the fact that you have so many applicants in front of you today for that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| less than a handful of attorneys are currently serving those substitute positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| receiving the pay rate of $16 an hour, working both night shifts and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Academic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| With regard to my academic background, while working full-time at the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| I earned my bachelor's degree with honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| During law school, I was very active in numerous school activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| including serving on the Student Government Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| and writing for the Tennessee Journal of Practice and Procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| While active in these activities, I earned awards in three different classes for the highest grade in the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| and ultimately graduated with honors and finished in the top 15 percent of my class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| Experience in the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Being raised by an assistant United States attorney gave me exposure to the judicial system from a young age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Exposure included attending criminal trials and observing oral argument in front of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1950)|
| 0:32:41| Then my work at the Knoxville Police Department allowed me to see the entire system from beginning to end on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| As an officer, I spent hundreds of hours in front of the judicial magistrate obtaining warrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| and observing how the office worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| As an attorney for nearly five years, I've worked on all types of criminal and civil cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Also, since 2009, I've had the pleasure and privilege of serving as a substitute judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| Mr. Cook, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Is there anything final you'd like to say to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| I'd like to point out, in fact, I'm serving as a substitute judicial magistrate tonight rather than celebrating with my wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| who today completed her last final exam of nursing school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Any questions for Mr. Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| We appreciate your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Timothy Householder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Timothy Householder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| He may have been one of those that said he was out of town today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Joseph, is it LaDato?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| And if you would give us your address for the record, please, when you get to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| You'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| My name is Joseph LaDato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I reside at 1008 Sanders Road in Cedar Bluff, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| I want to thank the commissioner for this opportunity to explain my qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| and hopefully answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Like Mr. Cook, most of my adult life has been in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| I was a police officer and a sheriff's officer for close to 13 years before making the move to attend law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| I've done clerkships at the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| as well as the Knox County District Attorney's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| I've been practicing mostly criminal law for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| For three years, I served as assistant district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Most of that time was spent in General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| I did private citizen warrant screening with the judicial commissioners for close to a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| before that policy was changed to have investigators review warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| In my practice, I've handled almost every aspect of what a judicial commissioner does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| I've attended Department of Safety seizure hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I know what the qualifications are for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| and I know what the Department of Safety looks for as far as seizing property and vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| I also know firsthand the split-second decisions police officers make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| and what goes into their probable cause determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| and I believe I'm well-suited to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| and also protect citizens from unlawful arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| and also protect the county from any exposure that might result from that while keeping the county safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| And, again, I would like the opportunity to return to public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| and to put my expertise to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| We don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| We appreciate your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Next we have Charity Miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2161)|
| 0:36:16| If we could get your address for the record, and you will have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I'm Charity Miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Address is 2529 Derrick Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| That's D-E-R-E-C-K, apartment F as in Frank Tan, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Again, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| I just first want to thank you for this opportunity to come before you to express my qualifications for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| I currently work with Legal Aid of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| where I practice primarily civil litigation representing low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| My passion has always been to do public service work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| and I believe that this is a primary example of where I can actually go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| and continue to do that public service here with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| I believe my qualifications, although my primary practice is civil litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| I believe that I can go in and pretty much just go and see exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| look at the facts of the case and determine if there's probable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I do have some criminal law experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| I clerked with two local attorneys here while I was in law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I also clerked with the Public Defender's Office in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So I do have the knowledge there to actually go in to assess the situation and determine if there's probable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| I believe that I'm the person that you should select for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| One, because I know the difference between being a judge as well as also being a judicial commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| or judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I will hear the case and only determine if there's probable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| I will not be trying to decide the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| And I think that that's a key role to do here with the judicial magistrate position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| I think that going into that position, you have to know to be able to distinguish between being a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and a judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| And I believe that I can uphold the integrity of the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you very much for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Christopher Oldham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2287)|
| 0:38:19| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| You'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| My name is Christopher Oldham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| My address is 1545 Coleman, C-O-L-E-M-A-N Road, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| And I have no prepared remarks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I just wanted to talk a little bit about my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| For the past 20 years, I've been practicing law in a general practice of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| It varies in between 0% criminal, 100% civil, up to at times 100% criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| Over the past 12 years, I've been a partner in the law firm of Gulley & Oldham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| They're a general litigation firm that does about 50% criminal and civil at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| The bulk of our criminal practice now is in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| Anybody that's been in a law firm or been in practice on their own understands that you sort of practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| with what comes through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And that's what I've done over the past, really the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| With the exception of two years, I was general counsel for a large electronics firm here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| And I grew tired of that and decided I wanted to be back with my feet on the ground in the legal community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| So for the past 12 years, we've been out there making a living practicing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| I have previously trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| The last time a judicial commissioner slot was open, I sat, I believe, with Mr. Major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| and did the training session before, but I've never sat as a substitute judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| I've always had concerns about it interfering with my federal practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| which has been a great part of my practice over the past seven to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| But generally speaking, that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| That's the life of a small, Knoxville being a small town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| in scheme of things, that's the life of a small town lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Any questions that you may have, I'd be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2416)|

| 0:40:20| Bailey Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| The next one, I hope I get this, is it Arun Ratan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| And I apologize if I did not get that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2430)|
| 0:40:39| And if we could get your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| And you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| My address is PO Box 24042, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2443)|
| 0:40:52| I've been licensed as a lawyer in Tennessee since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I recently moved to Knoxville from Nashville in June of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| And in Nashville, I worked as a hearing officer for the Department of Human Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| dealing primarily with welfare cases, including food stamps, Families First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| and among other cases, social security disability and child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| And it was an adversarial role where usually an individual's welfare benefits were terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| and he was given an appeal right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| And I presided over those hearings to make a decision as to, according to the income guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| and the rules of the Department of Human Services, whether the termination was proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| and the person appealing the decision had a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Thereafter, I worked as a solo practitioner since the end of 2008 until now currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| In Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| And I didn't -- I mean, I can't say I really enjoyed working as a hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| but looking back at it, it was a great learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| You know, I participated in a lot of hearings, regular hearings throughout the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| And it was a great way to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| And I've also been a part of the Nashville Bar Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| I've done pro bono work in employment discrimination cases and a contracts case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| And I've also been a volunteer judge at the Vanderbilt University mock trial college competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| And when I became a solo practitioner, I did a lot of criminal defense cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| participated in a lot of preliminary hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| And I'm involved in one criminal defense case right now in Blount County in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2579)|
| 0:43:09| Or actually, two cases in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And so, you know, I feel like I do have the experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| I can certainly understand the basis of what's required to issue a search warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| with the probable cause determination is, remaining neutral, an analysis of the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2604)|
| 0:43:35| to determine if there's any possibility of evidence of a crime existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And so I feel I do have the understanding for this job, and I also have experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Is there anything finally you'd like to say to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| If not, sir, thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| John, is it Ralph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Ruth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| If you would give us your address for the record, please, and you will have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| My name is John W. Ruth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| If you know me, you know me as Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I live at 1120 Snowden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| My zip code is 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| I have been an attorney since 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| My first contact with General Sessions Court was actually in 1982 when I worked in the Criminal Defense Clinic at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| UT Law School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Upon graduation, I entered into actually two firms with over the first 20 years of my practice that I had a general practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2670)|
| 0:44:42| During that time, I was selected as one of the first four judicial commissioners here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| when that program was started again in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| I have also served as a special judge both in General Sessions Court and in municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| I think that helps to understand where the process is going, what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| In particular, the decisions that you may make in the middle of the night as a judicial commissioner may stay a while with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| litigants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| The best part, and I can tell this to anyone who serves as a magistrate now that they've changed that name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| is the interaction that you have not only with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| and it is wonderful to see the work that the men and women in uniform do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| It is also great to see the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| I'm proud to be an attorney and have been active in the Bar Association, of course, as most of us have been over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| My practice is with the public, and that is the thing that's going to be the toughest thing for any applicant to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2755)|
| 0:46:06| is not just the defendant that's before you for arraignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| but you need to take into consideration the people who are witnesses and the people who are the victims in the alleged crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2772)|
| 0:46:22| We don't have a long involvement with a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and the elected judges are the ones who will decide what should happen with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| But it is a privilege and an honor to serve, and I look forward to doing that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| My practice at this time is mostly in probate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I also work in juvenile court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| and I have assisted the court in three seminars in recent years for the newer practitioners in that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| Again, it's a privilege to be considered for the position, and I wish you all the best of luck in your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Mr. Roth, have you subbed since 1994?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| I apologize, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Commissioner, could you put your microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Have you subbed since 1994, what it says on your sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| I have not substituted for the judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| I've had an active criminal practice until recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I would not need to do a whole lot of shuffling to move that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| I'm concentrating on the two areas I mentioned as well as mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| I have not substituted since 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| I have sat in in municipal court and general sessions court for the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you, sir, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| Christopher Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| You'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| My name is Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I go by Chris Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| My address is 110 Greenbrier Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919 in the wonderful Westwood neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| Just to tell you a little about myself, I grew up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| attended actually Harrison Chilhowee Baptist Academy in Seymour is where I graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| It's now known as King's Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Went from there to David Lipscomb University in Nashville and from there on to Covenant Seminary in St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| Louis where I earned a Master of Divinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| At that time, my life was looking into a career in ministry and actually came back to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| and did an internship with West Hills Presbyterian Church here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| During that time, that internship, I took a trip to South Africa for a mission trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| It happened to be in 1998 during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| And I began to take an interest in law, seeing South Africa and the scars of an unjust legal system that had been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2920)|
| 0:48:51| had been in place, and then their efforts to renew it got me thinking more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| So I thought more about law, talked to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Went to the University of Tennessee Law School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| While I was there, I clerked for the law firm of Eldridge & Blakeney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| did a lot of research in the area of criminal law, drafted a lot of motions and appellate briefs in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| And then began, well, then after law school, actually had some ideas of corporate law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| So I did an MBA afterwards while I was taking the bar exam and waiting for those results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| I began my own practice in 2005 and did mainly criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| I had, because of my experience with Eldridge & Blakeney, that was a logical place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| And during that time, I was asked by one of the judges to serve as a substitute judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| At the time, I had no idea what that was, but I thought if a judge asked me to, I'd better agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| And so I volunteered, served for several years as a substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| up until taking a position in January of 2010 with the Public Defender's Office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| And I've been there since, working primarily doing DUI defense in the General Sessions Court here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| I enjoyed my time as a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Also, I did, while I was in private practice and able to do so, served as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| sat as a special judge on a number of occasions for, in fact, for Judge Stansbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| and for a couple of the other judges when they needed a fill-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| As others have said about the judicial commissioner position, it's one of those, it's the gatekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3027)|
| 0:50:36| It is that first moment where the rights of the individual, the concerns of the community come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| as warrants are approved, as bonds are set, and as the arraignments are carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| I enjoyed my time as a substitute commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| and it would be a privilege to serve as a full-time commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Scott, and again, I apologize if I get this incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3061)|

| 0:51:14| Is Mark Wood here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| Sir, if you would give us your address for the record, you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| My name is Mark Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| I live at 2207 Jockey Run Trail, South Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| I guess I began in 1984 as a police officer when I graduated from college, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| The last three years I spent with Judge Goodall, Thomas Goodall, shoulder-to-shoulder as his clerk and court officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3101)|
| 0:51:51| I began my legal practice ten years ago as a criminal defense lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I've maintained that practice this entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I've practiced on city, state, and federal levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| I am a substitute commissioner at this time, and I thank you for your time and look forward to your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3123)|
| 0:52:12| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| We appreciate your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| These are all the people that we have listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Was there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| If not, I'm going to contact Judge Stansberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I believe he's left their chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Oh, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Oh, I'm sorry, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Is there any way that you could, you and your colleagues, could get us your list of eight by, say, Thursday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Friday morning, because this will give us the opportunity to look at it over the weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| I'll give it to you any time you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Commissioners, do you think Thursday would be plenty of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Thursday, if you could get it to us Thursday to the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| then she can send them out to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| But that will just give us adequate time to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Consider it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Judge, and this is just me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| It's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| You do what you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| But I know you can choose up to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| But let's say you get between number four and number five and there's a major difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| You think you've got five really strong people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| I like just to have your top five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| You know, don't feel that you have to be obligated to do eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| But, you know, if you want to put eight, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| But if you think these are the really top ones, I just prefer you just give us your really top notch people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Any other questions for the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Again, thank you for your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| And we look forward to working with you and making the selection on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Yes, do we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| We're going to take a quick break and come back at 3.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| It will give us seven minutes just to kind of stretch our legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| So we'll be back in session at 3.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3209)|
| 0:53:53| We need to get the sheriff's department to put these bracelets on our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| That way we can buzz them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| And when they feel the shock, they'll know to get back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| We'll also give it to the mayor and the mayor can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Do you want to give this to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Petco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3250)|
| 0:54:31| Well, we have six commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| We have a quorum, so we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Clerk, if you would read item number six into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| Page two, a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| approving the appointment of as magistrate for Knox County, resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| It would be appropriate to send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Is there a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3295)|
| 0:55:03| On page four, item number 21, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| Tennessee adopting the debt management policy for Knox County government is promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| by the Knox County Department of Finance, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Mr. Troyer, would you explain to us about this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| One of the things when we were discussing this with the mayor about what a debt policy should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| a couple of things we thought were most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| We wanted to make sure that we complied with the state and local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| We wanted to make sure it was open and a transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| We wanted to make sure that it was a logical process to issue debt on behalf of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| And we wanted to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| And so we reviewed several debt policies from Hamilton County, Shelby County, Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3347)|
| 0:55:57| as well as took some of our own ideas and suggestions from the comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| and consolidated it into one proposed policy, which is here for your consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| Also, you have passed out the budget and brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| I think this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Would you like to explain to us about these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Are these available for anyone to have, any citizen or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| You got them hot off the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| And I've got to give credit to Chris Caldwell for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| And what we tried to do is if you're going to capture the county's budget on one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| what information would you like to have on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| And this was our best effort at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| And we certainly welcome any comments or suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| But we're glad to provide those if you want to go to like lunch meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3398)|
| 0:56:46| or if you have to have speaking engagements and want to share some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| We're also going to try to get that on the website so they're there for everybody to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Yeah, John, could you just kind of hit the high points of the debt policy for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| High points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| One of them right off the bat is that it would take another policy that would be separate that would allow for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| derivatives or swap transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| And so in the absence of that, future swap transactions are prohibited unless the county commission were to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| and pass a policy, and that would have to be issued in accordance with that policy that's not been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| So in the meantime, they're prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| I think that's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| There's a number of requirements that before we issued debt we would have to do some homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| and we'd also share information on how much it would cost, how much we expect it would cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| and our rationale, why we would do fixed, why we would do variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| and present that with the proposed resolutions for debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| I think I have read this stuff over the weekend, and John and I talked briefly before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| I think that's the most important thing is to not to throw it out in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| and before commission and the public and other entities about before we get any swaps anymore, any derivatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| That's the greatest thing of this proposal, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| John, let me ask you two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Page five, the type of debt that you consider selling, G.O. debt, we all know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3503)|
| 0:58:31| Give me an example of a capital lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| We have used in the past some capital leases for some of our energy management projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| It is a methodology that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| And in the end, we ended up refinancing it as we saw opportunities to do that cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| But it has the same function as bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| But, like, the energy efficient stuff out at the jail, was that a capital lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| A big piece of that was a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| We have used them especially for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And there's a couple of reasons for the that it's helpful on the school side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| But, anyway, it's another methodology that I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| Yeah, I think it's a good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| You know, you have vanilla bonds, chocolate leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| There's two different ways to get to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Along that line, give me an example of a, I don't know if we've done this since I've been sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| revenue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| I know what it is, but give me some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And we have no expectation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| But if KUB were to issue bonds and use future utility revenues to back that, that would be revenue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| Do we have any on the books now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| There are none on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| I didn't think there was any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Like, the city has KUB airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| So my next question was, it's moot now, but if the revenue dried up to service that debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| would we step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| It's all hypothetical, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Generally, we would be considered conduit debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| And so that would only be to the extent of the revenues that would supply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| But, you know, that would be specific to the bond resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| And no, we're not anticipating issuing any revenue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| And last question on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| This is only, in my short experience, tans and bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| That's only when a municipality is in pretty rough shape, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And we wouldn't be issuing any tans or bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| You mentioned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| There are reasons to issue a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| Tax anticipation notes, the tans, we haven't had to do that, and I'm thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| We've got adequate fund balances to make it until the first round of property tax collections are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| And so we have enough funding to do that, and a tan is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| And so that's something that we should be proud of for Knox County's financial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| Bond anticipation notes, it's helpful if there's – and we have issued one in my term here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| and that was in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| It's been fully paid off with permanent financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| But if there's – it's kind of a half step into our financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| And maybe we're not quite sure the timing of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| and that helps us meet the spend-down requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| There's a little more lax spend-down requirements on a band than there would be the permanent financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| And we can issue for a smaller amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| So they happen occasionally, but not regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| It's a nice instrument to have if you needed the band anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Thanks for putting this together, and I will – maybe we can talk about it again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Commissioners, I was informed by Commissioner Owenby just a couple of minutes ago that Mr. Bill Talent has passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| Our condolences, of course, go out to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| But on a personal note, as a young reporter, I had an opportunity to interview Mr. Talent on several occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| as he was a member of the, at that time, three-person county commission in the old county court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| He was a gentleman in every sense of the word, a great public servant for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| He was a veteran, and he will certainly be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Our condolences go out to his family on the passing of Mr. Talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Item number 22, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| constituting the Knox County Charter Review Committee and providing for an effective date for appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| Thereto, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Mr. Law Director, would you tell us our obligations and what we need to be doing by the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Let me just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| Sorry, I have too many documents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3780)|
| 1:03:14| Yes, in a nutshell, commissioners, what you'll be doing is establishing this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| You'll be setting a hearing date, or I should say a date for which incident applicants can come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3797)|
| 1:03:25| And be interviewed similar to that which you've done in the past any time you appoint someone to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Once that is finalized, then you can charge the committee with its duties and responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| which is essentially to take a look at the Knox County Charter to determine whether or not it merits changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| and what resolutions ultimately turn into ordinances they would care to submit to the commission for review in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3822)|
| 1:03:50| How many people do we select, and how many does the mayor select?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| The way it works, it's actually 27 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Now, again, the problem you have, of course, is when this was initially promulgated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| your commission was a totally different composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| But in a nutshell, you'll be nine county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| There will be nine individuals that will be vetted by the commission, and then the mayor submits nine names to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3849)|
| 1:04:19| What about the at-large commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| You said nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Well, that's the rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| The way your charter reads, it's 27 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| And it presumed at that time that there were two commissioners per nine commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| and it was crafted at that point to have one commissioner from all nine districts for a wider representation of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| That charter has remained unchanged, so it will be the nine commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| That's the way the charter reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Yes, that's not occurred to me, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| And I was thinking about that when you called my name, and I've got to think about what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| Oh, when we set up the --I assume that we're going to do a series of interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| and because we're going to --everyone votes on each commission's or each district's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| So if we've got only three, I mean, you know, as few as three applicants from each district, that's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| I mean, that's a lot of people to interview at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| How are we going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| What's our process going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Well, in the past, I think when they put this together, it was under the whoever that commissioner brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| kind of like with the library board and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| And last time we did something like this, the commissioner in their district spoke to who was interested in the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| and then brought them before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| And that's how that has generally worked in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| So it would be up to each commissioner then to set up an interview process in their own district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| I can't remember what we did it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| We did it like Sam did his at Burlington Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Yeah, so it's very similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| That would be a good suggestion is each commissioner bring forth a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| If you have more than one in your district, it would be up to you to look at them and bring forth that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| So just to follow up with that, say we had to interview five folks and we choose one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| Well, the other four are a six person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Are they okay to submit an application to be considered here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| So we would recommend one and there may be three other folks from the ninth district wanting to be in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| So we'll interview them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Is that figured out at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Is that how we're looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Well, let's try to figure it out beforehand if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| What are your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I mean, if you bring forth one, but there's three or four more from your district that want to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| are we going to listen to everybody or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Pass it on to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I mean, we get nine appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| No, I'm saying if we, quote, unquote, recommend, we go through our district process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| and someone wants, you know, continue to apply or late or just change their mind at the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| how are we going to deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Do we do anything without those extra names if there is one, if there are names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| To me, it would be just like taking somebody from the audience on any other appointment we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| If there's anybody in the audience that wants to bring themselves forward, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| So commission would ratify those nine names before we leave that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| That's kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Each person, you have to vote on each person individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| So I guess, Mr. Law Director, you said we have a 27-member review committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| And so if we do nine, that leaves 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| Where do the 18 come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Is that the mayoral appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Nine will be members of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Nine will be nominees that will be nominated by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Nine will be nominated by the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| However, the way this reads, it's not merely you ratifying the mayor's choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| but actually still voting on each nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| So it will be nine commissioners, nine citizens from the nine commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| and nine from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| I just want to make sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| On the --you know, we had this thing come up about having a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| You know, this went back a long time ago, about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| And my recollection was that with the mayor's appointees, we either rejected them or accepted them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| But I mean, this is going on a four-year-old recollection because we rejected, if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| the mayor submitted those names, and it was voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| And we didn't vote on them individually, but we either accepted all of them as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| or rejected all of them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| And I don't --you probably have the charter right there in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| but that was my recollection of what happened because I know there was a lot of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| consternation about who, you know, who the mayor appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| But we didn't vote on those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| We just rejected them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Well, the way the charter reads verbatim, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| each nominee shall be voted upon individually by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| With that plain language and the fact that this hasn't been interpreted by the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| you presume then that if the mayor comes and gives you nine names, you will interview those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| and you will vote on them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| And if you reject them, then the mayor is going to have to give you another name until that process is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| Mr. Wright was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| With the mayorial appointments, are they spread out over the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| It reads, Commissioner, that it says nine registered voters of Knox County who are not members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4199)|
| 1:10:10| to be nominated by the Knox County mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| So it doesn't make any proviso beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| But it does read that no more than two such citizen members who are registered voters of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| should be nominated from each commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| If it's no more than two commissioner, no more than two citizens from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| if there is an appointment by commission in a district, then there can only be one other person in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| So then does it make it look like the mayor should have his spread out over the county also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| Well, unfortunately, we're stuck with this language, and it isn't a modicum of clarity, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| But it merely reads that the mayorial appointments, it says that they shall be registered voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4253)|
| 1:11:03| Ostensibly, the purest form would be, of course, your nine commissioners and then 18 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| two from each of the nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| That would be the perfect, purest interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| And that's kind of the way I was reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| But then getting past this selection process, somewhere here I need to know what it is I'm trying to sell this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| that I'm trying to get appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| What will this committee be doing on what timetable headed toward something to be before the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4289)|
| 1:11:38| Those kinds of questions is my next set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| There are some lengthy qualifications, or I should say the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| But in a nutshell, the whole idea is that they will review any and all proposed charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4308)|
| 1:11:57| and basically review the charter to see whether or not it merits changing and what proposals they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| It requires publishing in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| Essentially, there's a time frame that they have to coordinate with the supervisor elections 30 days before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| So it's a bit involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| But the bottom line is that the whole purpose is to determine whether or not the charter merits changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| and what recommendations, if any, they would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| And you use the word election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| That's general election every two years in the fall, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Yes, unless there's a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| But generally, that's the whole intent of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Can you provide us with kind of a one sheet as to their responsibilities so we'll have that in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| when they're talking with individuals about serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| And this will we're wanting to do this next month, as I understand, in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Did you have anything else, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| I just want to tell Mr. Wright, the mayor has already told me he's going to take all his from the seven districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| He's going to choose all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| The older new seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| That's my question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| What do we go with the new redistrict as of, what, December 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Is that when it went into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Yes, redistricting is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| So the people we choose needs to be in the redistricted area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| That's clarification for everybody else, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| On page five, item number 24, and it's a revised resolution 902,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| a resolution requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission forward a letter to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| legislative delegation requesting that the delegation petition the governor to delay the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| of the Knox County-based Lakeshore Mental Health Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I would like to recuse myself at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| I'd like to say that I have talked with not everyone but some people involved in mental health here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4450)|
| 1:14:18| The question I ask is, what's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| No one seems to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I don't think there is a plan, and this is not meant to be criticism of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| It's the fact that if and when Lakeshore closes, and they certainly have the prerogative to do that, we don't know the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| We will be responsible for picking up the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Organizations here will be responsible for looking at how they're going to operate with the closure of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| I know that this body has gone through extensive public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| We have had opportunities to have public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| I do not see that as having occurred with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I think this is a significant move, and I know that the state has the opportunity to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| I endorse this resolution that we ask the state to move perhaps a little more slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Let's have a process so that we as the legislative body can have not input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| but just clarification of what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| And I don't think that that's too much to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| I know that they've said that they're going to stop taking patients by the end of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| that they are going to completely close within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| It seems to me to be a very short time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| And so I have no qualms at all about asking the state to slow down just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| Let's meet with these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Mr. Ryan Haynes will be meeting with us on Monday during our chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| We'll have an opportunity to ask questions then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| But that's only one part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I think that we need to talk with mental health providers here in Knox County so that we fully understand what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| and so we fully understand the impact of what is about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| So I will be voting in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| And I applaud Commissioner Ornby for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| You know, I agree with much of what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| I've talked to a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| You know, this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| It's really been a state decision and not a local decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| And it doesn't mean necessarily that we really have any input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| We're just asking someone to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| But I did also try to talk to some of the, you know, some of the, in particular, one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| one of the mental health institutions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| And they said that they have received a briefing on what would happen, that there was going to be state monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| to take care of some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| And also that as part of this whole plan, the state had talked with the local attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| and also with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| And, like I said, this is with limited information that there was a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| And, actually, this person thought that the plan was pretty good and it might be able to provide better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| I'm really not advocating for or against the, you know, what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| But the thing is that I think we just have a lack of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| I mean, we're sort of out here in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| This comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| And I do thank Commissioner Ornby for bringing this forward for us to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| Because it does have an impact, if there isn't a plan, you know, very much on our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| whether it's stressing the present mental health facilities, the jails, the judiciary system, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| If these people are turned out on the street, something like what happened about 30 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| when they just pretty much opened the gates and contributed to chronic homelessness that we're experiencing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| But, really, I think there's just a tremendous lack of information that we have on what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| And I'm making a comment, not a plea to vote one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| But, you know, we're really acting without a lot of information about what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| And if there's anybody there that knows anything, you know, I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| Would you all like to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Would you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| If it's okay, Commissioners, we'll let these two individuals speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| And if you give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I'm losing my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Ruthie Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| I live at 4205 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| And my husband says this is his miracle for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| And you all know me well enough to know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| I've known, like Sean, been involved with what's going on there for about 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| Back in the 70s, we discovered my older brother, seven years older, was manic depressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| They call it, I think, bipolar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| My parents got him admitted to what we called it Eastern State back then, but Lakeshore, because of his manic state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4720)|
| 1:18:51| They took care of him on and off for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| Then for a while, he settled down, took his medication, and it became an illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| It's not a disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| It's an illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| He passed away in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| But throughout the years, he would quit taking his medication because he thought he was well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| When you're on that level, you think everything's fine and you quit taking the medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| You become belligerent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| You become mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| Sometimes he would get on a high and he would go out and purchase cars and diamonds and jewelry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| He would give it all away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| He would have his family jewelry, and he gave all of his family jewelry that he got from grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| and whatnot, gave it all away and we couldn't get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| He would buy Cadillacs and stuff and give it away to friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| We had nowhere but Lakeshore to put him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| Then after my parents died, I was left to take care of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| But when he found out I would go to the jails and talk to the judges, he would threaten me with my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4801)|
| 1:20:09| and come, I would find out, and sit in my driveway and just sit there in the middle of the night with me not knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4809)|
| 1:20:20| It did no good to have him in the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| All he would do would be to sit there with the criminals and do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| I would not put him anywhere because he was 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| And the only way I could do it was to take over his being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4836)|
| 1:20:44| But if I did that, I was putting my life in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| They wouldn't put him into Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| I had no power, and that's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| We can't make it so that if the family has no power that you can't put people, these ill individuals in a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4854)|
| 1:21:05| Lakeshore is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| You know, Knox County is the third largest in the state for mentally ill being in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4868)|
| 1:21:17| That is not where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| They're ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| They are ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| They're not criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| They're ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| He was ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| And this is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Where are they going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| They're going to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| They're going to hurt someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Bipolar is an illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Manic depressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| You're high, then you're low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| He tried to kill my sister one day until I jumped on his back and pulled him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| That's the illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| They don't belong in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| They need Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| And I beg you to help Jeff with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| I'll do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I'll go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| I'll talk to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| But it never dawned on me that they would close Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| And granted, there are not many people there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| But please help Jeff work on getting this to stay open because the citizens in this area need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| They don't need to be in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Barbara Pelo, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| There are a number of reasons that I wanted to speak with you today, and I appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| I also appreciate Commissioner Orenby bringing this resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| I have attended the public opportunities for conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| and for getting information about this very crucial issue to our community, both our city and our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4966)|
| 1:22:55| And, frankly, in going to those meetings and listening to the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| I realized that this affects a number of counties surrounding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| And so it's really an East Tennessee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| My concern, of course, is for those who need this kind of supervision, this kind of medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| this kind of opportunity to be treated in a way in which they can have as satisfactory a life under the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=4998)|
| 1:23:28| that they have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I guess my interest in this really became so strong when my husband opened the dental clinic at the VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5011)|
| 1:23:41| for, we thought, the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| But in caring for those people and being there every Friday for ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| it became obvious to me that many people were there because they had mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| that simply needed constant supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| I agree totally with Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner Briggs and the comments they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| We don't know what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| And after spending two long evenings in meetings, which I very much was looking forward to getting information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| unfortunately, it was just questions that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| And my little experience in public service is that it's so critical that our community have answers, specific answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5064)|
| 1:24:34| I think we all feel we've been dealt a blow when Lake Shore changed its face a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5074)|
| 1:24:43| And we began to see those people on our streets, those people in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| And then it was up to folks such as you and the city council to deal with how law enforcement could try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5089)|
| 1:24:59| in some way, meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| It is not a law enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| I don't know if Lake Shore remaining open is the answer, but we don't know exactly what is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5105)|
| 1:25:15| We are told things will be better, and that would be wonderful for those people who need treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5115)|
| 1:25:24| However, I'm old enough to remember that we were told that when Lake Shore was cut back years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5124)|
| 1:25:33| Things did not get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| It is, in my belief, our moral and ethical responsibility, our public servant responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5135)|
| 1:25:46| to find how the needs of these people are going to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| I've heard great suggestions in some of the conversations I've participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| And I feel that may be a great answer, but we want to hear something definite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| And I think our governor and our representatives would appreciate hearing from you, officially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5163)|
| 1:26:13| to ask that time be put on hold for us to receive some of those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| This community deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| The surrounding counties that cannot provide as much service as Knox County provides for its citizens deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| And certainly, these clients who look to Lake Shore for a safe place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| and to continue to try to have a satisfactory life deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5201)|
| 1:26:50| And I think just calling on the state to come and have conversation with us so that trust can be rebuilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| and so that we can all work together for what's going to be best for everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| And thank you so much for giving us a few moments of your time this afternoon, this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| If you'd like to speak and give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| My name is Susan Vanacore, and I live at 417 Port Charles Drive in Farragut, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5236)|
| 1:27:26| I am a licensed clinical social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| I am retired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| My education is from New York State, the New York State University at Stony Brook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| where I received my bachelor's and my master's degree in social work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| I have a son who is going to be 27 years old, who on August 22nd, although he had never been violent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5262)|
| 1:27:50| he had been diagnosed when he was a teenager with adolescent onset schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5270)|
| 1:28:02| We found great difficulty in finding care for him down here because with the new Medicare regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| my son was on Medicare, and many doctors would not take him, accept him as a patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| One doctor in particular closed her practice because she could not deal with all the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| and the paperwork and maintain a client schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| My son then went to different agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Unfortunately, at the different agencies, you don't always see the same doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| Many of the doctors who go to perhaps Peninsula or different agencies go there and start out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| and build up some experience and then leave and open a private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| Now, in my years in school, I learned that although the psychotropic medication is a great, great help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5333)|
| 1:29:02| for people who are persistent and severely mentally ill, something called a therapeutic relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| is also at the core of the healing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| This is a relationship with a doctor, with nurses, consistent people who will enable the patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5354)|
| 1:29:23| to establish trust and a sense of someone caring for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| When I speak to people from Lake Shore to other areas, I think that this is breaking that idea of relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| Not only has this been their home, the staff there has been their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| as other patients have also been their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| In volunteering at volunteer ministries and also at Lake Shore with my church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| I saw it in Lake Shore the last time we played bingo there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| And I saw an elderly man get up, one, and pick up this little pink fluffy thing that was a prize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| which I'm assuming was a stuffed animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| And I remember thinking to myself, I wonder why he's taking this with all the other things we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| Well, he took it and he went over to a lady that he knew and he gave it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| And he talked with her a few minutes and she smiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| These are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| These are our mothers, our fathers, our sisters, our brothers, our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| They deserve to have a life where they are respected and treated in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| On August 22, 2010, although my son had never been violent, he had a psychotic break and stabbed my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5440)|
| 1:30:53| The police came to the house, and I must say the police handled it in a way that was respectful of my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5453)|
| 1:31:03| respectful of me and my husband, who lay bleeding on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| The policeman was not violent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| None of them who came to the house treated my son with disrespect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| My husband was taken out quickly to the trauma unit at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| I credit that to the training that the sheriff's department, the police department, has given the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5482)|
| 1:31:31| I feel that the jails are too crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| My son has been there since 2010 in detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| I've not been able to visit him because I am the person who called the police that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| and I'm considered the witness for the prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| I have two other children who visit him who are not mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| We need places for people to get treatment who need more long-term treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| We need to remove the mentally ill from the jails so they also can get treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| and lighten the load on the staff at the prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| In talking to different officers, as my husband who did manage to survive this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| I found that many of the officers stated that in a situation where there is a mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| they are cautious and they are fearful, as I can well understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| We have Lakeshore where people are trained to deal with the severe and persistent mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| and I think it would be a great disservice for us to give that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| I see Knoxville as a city on the move, a city going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| I do not see it as a small town, as someone had said before, but I see it as a city with a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| And if we have a vision in Knoxville, we cannot leave out our most vulnerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| people who have no one really to speak up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| Also, another point I wish to make is I am speaking up as a mother and a social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| but there are many, many, many families in Knoxville who have relatives who are mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5592)|
| 1:33:19| and are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| They try to keep them at home and take care of them with frequent police visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| and frequent day treatment programs, frequent going to mental facilities that will keep them five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5607)|
| 1:33:36| or six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| They come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| They go to partial hospitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| They take their medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| An hour later, the whole process goes around again with the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| I think to save money and to provide the care and treatment for our brothers and sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| we could activate a system where we utilize Lakeshore, where we keep our dear patients who are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| We keep them with their family and keep them in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| And we look into the fact that caring for those in a mental hospital is cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| This is nationally proven in caring for people in jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| We would be saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| We would be taking a load off our prison system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Ma'am, I don't mean to appear insensitive, but I'd like to give you an extra minute or so if you wouldn't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| wrapping up for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Well, thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| This has been a terrible trauma for me to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| My son had a psychotic break and does not remember what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| My husband is left with a brain injury and only remembers part of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| And I don't want to see anybody else in Knoxville go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| And there are a lot of cracks in our system in getting care for even those who have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| And I, too, am concerned about a plan for the future, for the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| and for anybody else who's mentally ill in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| Because I was a consumer for my son, and it's very, very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| And the road is paved with good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| We need, as you said, Mr. Hammond, we need a concrete plan to follow for the upkeep for our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| And to remember finally that, as I said in the other meeting I attended, the mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| and the homeless, as the other lady said, too, can be mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| And I believe not cute and cuddly, but we are all God's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| And if they cannot speak up for themselves, it is our moral and ethical obligation to speak up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Mayor, would you like to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Yes, sir, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Tim Burchett, 62401 Airtree County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| A lot of these folks have spoke more eloquently than I could ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| But some interesting statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| I've dealt with some legislation in Nashville, the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| One in three of us are affected by it, either directly or indirectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| A family member or maybe yourself or someone that you come in contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| Our largest mental hospital in the state of Tennessee is the Shelby County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| I think that we need to make sure we direct this where it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| I think we need to make sure the governor knows this is an area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| I don't know on these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I've received a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| And I believe you'll find the level of frustration with the legislature is probably as great as with y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| I think you need to make sure that Chairman McNally knows your concern about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Although, technically, he has just a corner of Knox County, but he does chair the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| I believe you'll find that's probably where you'll be able to have some great impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| I believe it also boils down to dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| That's what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| They're going to say that it's going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| We always say that in government, but I don't ever see anybody paying less taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| The resolutions are fine, but I think that we need to make sure that we contact the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| I think that our Knox County delegation, you'll find, is probably one of the more adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5847)|
| 1:37:36| They're more adapted to what's going on in their community than probably any other legislative delegation in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| And I think that we better make sure that the commissioner of mental health knows what's going on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| that we are concerned and we want a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| I think that they probably have the same concerns that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| but they, like us, are looking at budgetary shortfalls and sometimes these maneuvers that they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5877)|
| 1:38:08| Although maybe they just need to have a little more study to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| And I think we need to address that with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| I don't know how you amend it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| I don't know who you send it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| But I would also say that the delegation knows that you're concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| but it wouldn't hurt that if you all were to call your respective legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| and let them know this is something that you're concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Because I guarantee you they are, they just need somebody to back them up on it and they'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5913)|
| 1:38:40| Mayor, I'd like to suggest that we amend the resolution to include letters to the commissioner of mental health, Mr. Varney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| to Senator McNally at your suggestion, head of the finance, Lieutenant Governor Ramsey, and Speaker Harwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| Is there anyone else that you would, in addition to our delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| I'd say our governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Governor, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| I'd make sure that he got a copy of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| And we'll, I guess, we'll go to work on that in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Well, now is the time to go to work on it, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| If we could get some sort of indication from our commissioner of mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| I think that would be the person that's, that needs to be, needs to inform us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5950)|
| 1:39:20| Because I'm frustrated just like you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Would the maker of the motion agree to that and the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| Okay, so we'll make that as part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| I'd like to thank these folks that came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| It took a lot of courage for them to come down front here and talk about family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| But it is an illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| It's not a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| And if we don't start addressing it as an illness in this nation, well, shame on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Yeah, of course, when the resolution first came out, it had a date and a two-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| And I was a little uneasy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| But I tell you, the most important part of this situation is, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| the care for those who can't care for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| But if there are savings from this proposal, those dollars need to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| Those dollars saved need to stay in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| They need to stay in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| And we need to develop a system of case management that spends those dollars wisely through VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6011)|
| 1:40:20| through Helen Ross McNabb, through Cherokee, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| We don't just need to watch these dollars go to waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| If these dollars stay in this region, if there's no we've got to have a place for law enforcement for mobile crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| I mean, mobile crisis comes out, and right now they either work an order up for Peninsula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| or they work an order up for Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| If they don't have insurance, they go to Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| So we need to make sure that we have our ducks in a row and that those dollars stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| We need to develop with the providers, with the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| and with the providers that the case management, the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Because last time when they closed Lakeshore on a downsize, the dollars didn't stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6058)|
| 1:41:06| And so we need to make sure that those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| we need to make sure our legislators are aware that the savings needs to stay in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| because the people don't become well when the hospital closes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| They become on the street citizens, and we need to make sure we take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| And we need to have a safety net to provide that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Mr. Chair, I guess I'm just trying to figure out to kind of piggyback on what the mayor was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6083)|
| 1:41:32| Somehow we need to engage the appropriate staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| And this is a great resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| I mean, even if it's stronger, I'm wanting to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| But, you know, is this enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Is this going to get the attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| I don't know how many pieces of mayor the commissioner receives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| but I'm sure the governor receives ten times that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| And while our Knox County delegation is extremely effective there in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| I do think hearing from, you know, a body like the commission, but actually hearing from them would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6122)|
| 1:42:13| So I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| If it means a visit, if it means a request to have a commission, I mean, it's a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| I'm sure he has a travel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| If he can come here and potentially engage in a dialogue with this body, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| I know he's been here before, but he could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| I just really, you know, this is one of those community-changing moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6151)|
| 1:42:40| Some people maybe think for the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| I tend to say I don't think we've thought about this particular move well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| And to do it strictly for a budgetary reason, I think I might be a little short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| And so that's, again, we can talk about it more on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| And I hope we do talk about it more next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| But somehow we need to ensure that we're not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| And the other end of it, I've talked about what are we going to do with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| To me, that's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| In my mind, if we go there, let's put some restrictions to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| if that's your ulterior motive, I'm not saying it is, that we're not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| We feel strongly and passionately about this facility, a facility like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| And we, you know, strongly enough to do and say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| But, I mean, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| it depends on how passionate we are as a body about this and how strong the statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| But I guess with that, I know my legislator, Joe Armstrong, Representative Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| is here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| And it would be great if he could say a few words, if he would, about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| I know he's been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6235)|
| 1:44:07| Representative Armstrong, if you could give us your address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| Joe Armstrong, 4708 Hilldale Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| And first I'd like to say thank you, Representative Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| for recognizing me and to the chairs and members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| This is a very, very sensitive issue, particularly with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| because I've been following what's been going on at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| since I was a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| And so when you look at the census of the campus there, back in the mid-'70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| there were over 3,000 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And since then, there's been a movement across the country for deinstitutionalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| which this institution has went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| But when you look at the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| we developed a master plan back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| It was refined again in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| And I think the latest was in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| And nowhere in any of those plans did it ever mention closing Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| Lakeshore has been the regional mental health hospital for East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| People from Mountain City, Upper East Tennessee, all utilize that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| not only because it stayed on, but because of the personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| and the capacities that they had built over the years to take care of those very, very special patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| particularly in the forensic area, particularly those that were energetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| and couldn't pay that the other facilities didn't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| Ninety percent of the patients there were non-paying patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| And you have over 60, 50 to 60 on the census that are long-term patients that have been there more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| And so, you know, when I look at the resolution that you're proposing, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| Because we've been doing a constant downsizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| If you go back and look in 2004, I think that it was 175 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| Now it's down to 125 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And so this has happened all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| But no one is closing facilities while they still have these patients that still need that institutional care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6388)|
| 1:46:37| And so I concur with the idea of continuing to downsize the institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| to turn around and to completely shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| Those patients are going to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| And when we talk about moccasin being in Chattanooga or sending them to Upper East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| where's the cost of transportation going to fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| And I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to fall right here on the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| It's going to fall right here on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| When you think about the $25 million, that's going to demise the services for mental health services in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6424)|
| 1:47:12| I'm not counting 300 jobs that will be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| And so I'd just like to commend you on really looking at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| And I know myself and other members of the General Assembly take very seriously the resolutions that come from our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6442)|
| 1:47:30| legislative body because you guys are much closer to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| And I always say, our politics are local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| And so we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| As I say, there is a way that we can continue to reduce the census at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| The footprint is getting smaller each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| but certainly I think that it will cause additional burden and additional cost to our local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6472)|
| 1:48:04| both county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Representative Armstrong, I think Commissioner McKenzie has a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| and that is request a meeting with Commissioner Varney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| Is that something that if we put in this resolution that you could help us set up this meeting as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| and ask him to come to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Mr. Chair, we met the Knox County delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| and I must say this for the record that a lot of members of Knox County delegation found out about the plans to close it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| from the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I happen to be fortunate enough to have served on the Lakeshore Board as well as the Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| And I got word of maybe an hour or two before it was released to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| But we did meet with Commissioner Varney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| and I asked at that meeting for him to give us a plan of what they plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| Everything we've heard has been word of mouth, nothing that concrete that we can say that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| the deadlines, this is what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| All we've heard is that they're going to stop admissions in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| The question is some of the patients at Lakeshore are on what they call a blacklist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| and they're not accepted at Peninsula or any of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Even some of the crisis intervention teams that are out there have dealt with these patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| and know that they need to be in a different type of setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| and that Peninsula doesn't have the necessary personnel to deal with some of these very, very some violent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6571)|
| 1:49:41| And then when we talk about forensic patients, I guess you can call them criminally insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| I know that's not the term, and I hope it's not derogatory or offensive to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| But for a lay person, I think they understand that people have been adjudicated there by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| Certainly, I think that having a meeting with the commissioner and continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| I haven't received the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| I hope when I receive it, I can distribute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| And I think you guys have questions here that only he can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Mr. McKenzie, have I stated that properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| Would the maker of the motion agree to that in a second to include that as having a meeting within the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| and request a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| One of my biggest concerns about all of this is, of course, what's happened with the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| I'm sorry, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| I don't have a direct question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Is there somebody else who had a question for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Does anyone else have a question for Representative Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| We need to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| I feel like there has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| and this is something that we as a local legislative body have worked very hard on for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| And I'm disappointed that we're not seeing the same effort made at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| the lack of inclusion in the local stakeholders, and also lack of respect for our legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6668)|
| 1:51:16| for the patients and their family, for the employees at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| My understanding is that they found out about this the same way in the same time that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| and that's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| I think that in absence of a black-and-white plan that we can hold in our hands and read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| misinformation flourishes and anxiety levels go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| There's a lot of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| One of the things that I heard in the past week is that, well, is it January 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| or now that they're getting sufficient public pushback, they've changed the closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| the date that they're going to stop admissions now, and it's no longer January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| It's some other date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| And I called Commissioner Varney's office last week to ask for more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| Unfortunately, I've not heard back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| To be fair, they may have called me today while I've been in meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| But, you know, I've called and asked for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| I've not gotten anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| I've spoken with some of our homeless services providers, and a lot of these mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| when Lakeshore closes its doors are going to wind up on the streets as homeless in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| and in Commissioner McKenzie's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| I've spoken with homeless services providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| They've not been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| They don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| We had our meetings set up this week with local mental health services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| and with our law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| No one's been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| No one's been consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| There is no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| This is absolutely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| So I hope that we will take as strong a stand as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| I hope that each of the remaining ten of you will also call Commissioner Varney's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| and ask to speak with him, encourage him to come here, call the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| We cannot let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| As Sam so eloquently said, it is a community-changing moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| And as far as the dollars go, my understanding from the word-of-mouth plan that I've heard is that those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6800)|
| 1:53:28| will be sent to the private hospitals such as Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| But there is no requirement for Peninsula or the other private mental health hospitals to take these patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6812)|
| 1:53:42| and they will wind up on the streets and cycling through our criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| So I hope that each one of you will make an effort, please, to call the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| and Commissioner Varney's office and let them know in person that this is not acceptable to us in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| that we do things differently here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| The motion on the floor is to approve the letter to the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| Also, the officials that we mentioned earlier, the Commissioner of Mental Health, Senator McNally, Senator Ramsey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| Representative Harwell, and ask for a meeting with Commissioner Varney within the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Motion is unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Item number 25, consideration of a resolution creating the Knox County Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| Commissioners, if I might, this was an idea that came out of NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Several communities have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| I found out that our law director did this down in Florida where he was law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| Basically, the idea is to inform our citizens as to the workings of their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| give them an opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| I know that in talking with Commissioner Burrell, she said that maybe the Junior League would want to participate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| with us, but it would be a one-day situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| It would be something where they would come for one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| We would do this maybe three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| And then it would be structured so that different departments of government would come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| brief them on what we do, and then give them an opportunity to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| So that is the basic idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Commissioner Burrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Actually, the Knoxville-Knox County League of Women Voters has been working on the concept of a Citizens Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| And I think what they are planning to do is a more expanded version of what Commissioner Hammond has put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| So I think it's something that will be a good match that we can have the one-day Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6941)|
| 1:55:49| And then for those who are interested and want more in-depth instruction or education on local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| can then proceed on to the League's more expanded Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| So I'm delighted to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| I thought when we saw it at NACo last year, it was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| And I really appreciate you bringing this and look forward to working with the League on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| And if you don't mind, Commissioner Hammond, I'd like to add my name to this as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| Certainly, I'm going to suggest that we postpone this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| so that we can meet with the Junior League and work all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| Maybe we can tie together something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| So, yes, I'd be happy to have you listed as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| But if someone could make a motion that we delay this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| it will give us a chance to look into this a little more with the League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7000)|
| 1:56:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| We'll postpone that 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| This resolution was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| This is a resolution requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission forward a letter to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| Legislative Delegation requesting that they oppose any changes to the Tennessee Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| as applied by political subdivision of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| This is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7029)|
| 1:57:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| This is to oppose any change in the state regulations, not what we put together here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7036)|
| 1:57:26| If I could, this is what occurred, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| There was a resolution by the Williamson County Commission that was then adopted by the Tennessee County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| Commission Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| And essentially, they are vetting legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| They already have sponsors that would change state law, but as applied to local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| So presently, if two or more commissioners of the same body meet, there is a public meeting in their midst, hence the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7068)|
| 1:57:55| requirement to publicly notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| The proposal is to change it that county commissioners can meet in secret, provided there's not actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7078)|
| 1:58:07| physical quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| So the bottom line is, you know, currently a quorum for you is a simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| So if five commissioners, four or three, wanted to meet under this change, they would no longer have to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7094)|
| 1:58:23| They could do so in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| So even though it's a change in the state law, it's as applied to local legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| That's going totally to the other end of the spectrum, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| It's counter to that, which has been in the books before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| That's presently the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Mr. Arnby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| Yes, I just want to say that being quiet for 20 minutes has been hard for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| I know you all have been happy, but I'd like to say, first, I'd like to add on to this as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7132)|
| 1:59:02| I think this is a bad move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| What we have in place here is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| And using us as an example of what happened four years ago is exactly why we need to keep what we have in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| I'm not for changing anything and just keeping the way that we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| So I will support this, and I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| And, again, I tend to support this, but my questions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| whenever you have a question on the side, you're somehow against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| So let me my first words are I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| But question to the law director, and it's just wanting a clarification on what these other commissions are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7185)|
| 1:59:52| Because what I don't want is for us to, you know, get to have a perception that we're holier than thou| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| and we're standing up because past bad acts that we're in a totally different level than they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| So I'm trying to understand what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| And I think I heard something when Mr. Lauder was asking Commissioner Brown's question that I want to ask about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| or dig a little deeper on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Are they proposing that they meet, that they can meet as have an encounter at a meeting with two or three of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7217)|
| 2:00:26| or deliberate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| The way they want to change the law is they want to redefine basically a quorum, meaning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Right now in the law, two or more commissioners cannot purposefully meet to discuss county business unless it's noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| Their proposal is that as long as there's not a quorum but two or three or four county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7242)|
| 2:00:53| they can meet in secret and discuss county business that they'll even ultimately vote upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| But they can discuss but not deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| No, they can do both is what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| That's the whole idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| They're trying to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| So, and again, you know, this is a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| It's tough to see what the actual bill will look like because it's not drafted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| All we have is the resolution being vetted by Williamson County, but it appears to have gotten steam that it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| into a bill, but it basically says as long as it's not a quorum, several commissioners can meet in secret, deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7278)|
| 2:01:25| make decisions, do whatever they'd like to do, as if it was a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| So go ahead, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| Okay, just real quick and then I'll give the mic up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| So what I'd like to see is a little more flesh on what we're against then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| Could we say specifically what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| We don't we disagree with any deliberation, any, you know, could we put more of those words in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| We can keep all these words in and we don't have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| But what I'd like to just to paint a better picture of what we're trying to say we're not for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| and that's that whole deliberation thing that Commissioner Brown just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| Well, the other thing, too, is I was on a legislative panel where these types of things were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| Some states have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| The issue, though, becomes if you do allow people to meet and it's not a quorum and they can deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| nothing would prevent me from getting in touch with you four and having a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| and then the next day meeting with you four and having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I mean, it's so there are ways of circumventing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| That's why the law that we have, it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Things seem to be working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| But there are those that would like to see it changed for this whole quorum issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| My point is, as I said earlier, the fact that it's going to the total far-fetched realm of the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| There's got to be a happy medium somewhere in there where there has to be some type of relaxing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| where the people sitting in chairs such as this can talk to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7372)|
| 2:02:58| and get information they need to make the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Now, I totally disagree with it going to what the law director just said, you know, that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7381)|
| 2:03:09| But I said there's got to be a happy medium somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| I understand what Commissioner Brown's point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| I think what's happened in this county four years ago or what did happen four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| It was going to be five years ago when January 31st of 2007, so almost five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| pushed us to where we have to be the other extreme now of just prohibiting any thing that may remotely look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| The Sunshine Law has been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| And I was sitting out in the audience on January 31st of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| and I think when the deals got cut there weren't quorums in the corners that cut the deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| It was three or four guys and three or four guys and four or five guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| It wasn't a quorum anywhere near a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| So what I read in some other newspapers throughout the state is that there is a movement to liberalize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7436)|
| 2:04:06| By a lot of the other commissioners, I did read that Ray County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| and Anderson County have voted as this resolution would state our position on a split vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7450)|
| 2:04:18| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| I think it was 7-2 and 9-4, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| They have voted to leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| But there's no question there's a movement statewide to liberalize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| and there's some people in the General Assembly that are going to sponsor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| And that may back off if there's media heat or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| But as it stands now, it will be dropped in the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| And so it will be moved through the system in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| So I just wanted us to get on board in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| Excuse me, now December, January, everybody meets in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| The General Assembly convenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| And so I wanted our intention to be made known to our legislative delegation where we stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7489)|
| 2:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7498)|

| 2:08:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Buzz Johnson will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| He's the chair of the stormwater ordinance review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| So, Buzz, would you come forward and explain what we're up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| Buzz Johnson with the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| You may recall that back, I guess it was four or five months ago, maybe sooner than or not that long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| we presented to you a report from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| It was reviewed by the planning commission, accepted by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| and we presented a report to you from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| The committee came about as a resolution that was adopted by this body almost three years ago that asked a review be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7722)|
| 2:08:51| of the stormwater ordinance as well as development procedures relating to development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| The committee worked over a two-year period, two-and-a-half-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| reviewing, talking about the issues, coming up with some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| It was a fairly broad-based committee that included professionals in the field of stormwater management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| state representatives, included developers, included engineers and surveyors, as well as county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7756)|
| 2:09:27| In the report, we came up with about nine or ten recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| The first recommendation was to consider establishing what has been termed a stormwater advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| And what I'm here today is to initiate a dialogue discussion, however you want to discuss it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| get some direction from you, but continue to discuss the possible establishment of what could be called a stormwater advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7786)|
| 2:09:55| It could take the form of a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| There's some subtle differences between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| It would have responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| It would have a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| It would have a membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| It would have staff support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| And there are other things to consider about how the membership would take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| how the board or the committee would be selected, what their terms of office would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| and what bylaws and rules of procedure might be established for this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| The whole idea behind the group is, and it was the reason it was the number one recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7829)|
| 2:10:35| there was a sense from the committee that there ought to be something in place that could be ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| that could help the county identify and address stormwater issues as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| Off and on, this has been a very, very critical issue in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| I've been at these meetings, both in your regular session and in the zoning session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| where stormwater is discussed and it's been mentioned as a critical issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| an issue where there are problems that have been identified that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| And establishing some sort of structure, whether it be a board or whether it be a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| The board, as we envision, is a little bit more formal, probably would take an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| That would take a little bit longer to work through and establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| A committee would be a little bit less formal, but it would be established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| It would have some identity that could help work with county staff, work with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| work with other groups that could provide backup and support, help identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| and work through these issues that we seem to be affected by on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| Whatever weather events that we have, tornadoes that come through, things that affect stormwater in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7909)|
| 2:11:59| then this would be a mechanism that we could use to work through those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| come back with recommendations and have a full vetting by the community of how best to approach these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7923)|
| 2:12:13| What I passed out to you, and I think it was emailed to you, this is only a piece of paper with an idea on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7933)|
| 2:12:23| There could be other ways to work a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| This kind of identifies the board as a mechanism, but it could be a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| I think the one difference between a board and a committee as we envision it right now is the board would have appeal powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| of decisions that are made by the stormwater staff as they enforce the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| If you don't have the appeal process right now, I believe that's under the BZA structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| If you don't have that appeal, then it would probably be a committee, again, that would be there to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| as an instrument to help you and to help the county come up with ways and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7979)|
| 2:13:07| and things that can be used to address stormwater, the stormwater problems and issues that face the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| I'd be glad to answer questions in any kind of direction you'd like to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| We're going to be working on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| If we get a sense that you want to see something, we'll be coming back to the board within the next period of time with a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8000)|
| 2:13:29| Have you had the opportunity to sit down with members of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| and the county administration and go over this with them and get their input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| We have had representatives on the working group from the stormwater staff, the county engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8016)|
| 2:13:44| We've also had a member of the city engineering staff sit in for the kind of coordination effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8024)|
| 2:13:54| of identifying what they have been through, what they have had to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| If you term administration, that's where we've had that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| We haven't gone up further than that to present the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| but there have been representatives from both the city and the county involved in our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Hey, Buzz, you talked about committee versus board and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| You're saying they can appeal the fine from a noxious of Grandview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| and some of the staff went out and wrote a civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| They could appeal that through one of the committee or the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| Is that what you're suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| I'm not going to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| I'm not totally sure how that appeals process works through the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| but there are certain appeals that deal with stormwater that come through that body, I could be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| And that would be the function that would, if it's determined that that's what needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| that would be the function that would go to a stormwater advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| But they wouldn't be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| And I'm not sure the nature of those appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| So preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| I just wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| I mean, because Chancery Court would end up here in the final appeal, I guess, if there was an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| I have a question kind of along the same lines about an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| And what I'm hearing is that it would be an appeals process for those who have been levy-defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8116)|
| 2:15:24| or given a citation or whatever for violating the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8124)|
| 2:15:34| What about an appeals process for those who have been complaining about stormwater violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8134)|
| 2:15:41| but there's not been, to their mind, sufficient action taken by the county to address their problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8141)|
| 2:15:50| Would this also be a board that would undertake that, sort of like the city's better building board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| where people who feel like there have been violations that have not been addressed would be able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| and perhaps have this board take some sort of action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| I would say that that would be an appropriate issue to address as we define what we're talking about with regard to appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8170)|
| 2:16:18| I think it would be very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| You know, this may be not the place to talk about all of this, but, you know, the same thing gets down to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| I know we've had these stormwater meetings going on for a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| It sort of has, you know, fallen, you know, fallen into the shadows or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| where there's not been too much talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| But with all these concerns we've had about stormwater and silting and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| at some point we need to start looking if we want to pass ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| And we've talked about this before, about putting real teeth either through substantial fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8215)|
| 2:17:01| through stiffening the codes, through having more code inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| through requiring higher bonds on companies that are in particular at risk of going bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| And then the county is stuck with trying to fix some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| And I don't know if this would be something that that board would look at as an expanded function or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| But I don't know where we stand on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| We've been looking at stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| It seems like it's been two or three years now because I remember going to some of the meetings over there on Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| You were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| And, you know, at some point, the things that we want to accomplish, that's where they're going to be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8255)|
| 2:17:43| I mean, that's where we're going to be able to rectify some of the real injustices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| and then make people think about problems before they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| And I don't know if that's something that this advisory board would look at also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| And then, I mean, ultimately, those ordinances would have to come and the codes would have to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| And if I can elaborate, the board or committee, one of their one of the mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8284)|
| 2:18:12| one of the bullet points we list as a mission is to work through those recommendations that came out of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8292)|
| 2:18:19| And there was at least one recommendation, maybe two, that had to do with enforcement, had to do with bonding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| had to do with those kinds of issues that really get at how can you ensure that what is required is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8305)|
| 2:18:34| So, yes, we felt the committee would be a great way to work through those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8314)|
| 2:18:40| And once those are finished, are there other recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| Do they need to continue to look at other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| Yes, because I would hope, you know, after all we've been through with some of these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| that maybe we could reach a consensus because what I was even hearing from some of the developers that were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| is that they were saying, you know, don't pass binding laws or don't do this, and I don't want to refight those battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| But don't, you know, don't do this, but have stricter enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| And that's what they were telling us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| And so I would hope if, as we, you know, as we go forward, we'd be able to reach a consensus on those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8347)|
| 2:19:16| you know, particularly if we did have some hearings or we had a board like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| because that's really where we're going to have to fix some of the problems, you know, that we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| Couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| So this is for discussion purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Any direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| I'm getting some good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| We'll proceed to work through and come up with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| and it will be back before this body at some point, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| Thank you so much for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Item 30, discussion regarding the Jackson Law resolution process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| Commissioners, I've spoken to Solid Waste about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| This is an emerging body of law, and it's just too premature to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| And they agree, so I'd just like to remove that from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Item 31 is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| Do we have any other items to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| Thursday, I'm having a public meeting at the Time Warp Tea Room at 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| and coffee and treats are on me in celebration of the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8426)|
| 2:20:33| So I hope that everybody will come and join us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| and we'll have a good time sitting around and talking about what Santa Claus is going to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| Also, we will have the chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| We will not have a beer board meeting this month because we have no activity on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| so we'll be able to spend a little extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| And Representative Haynes will be joining us, and I'm working on a couple of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws111212?start=8450)|
