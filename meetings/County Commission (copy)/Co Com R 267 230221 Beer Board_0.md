| 0:07:21| All right, ma'am, you've heard the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| What do you say about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| We do plead guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| I have Erica, my bartender, with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=447)|

| 0:07:34| We definitely apologize and we definitely take this very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| We were going to have her take the ABC class again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| but her license does not expire until 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| She was unable to get in to take it, but we are willing to pay for a class for her to retake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=466)|

| 0:08:22| You had a violation nine months ago where you sold beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Are you saying that it was a different individual that happened at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| So now this is your second offense within nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| It was a different individual and we did take her off the schedule for about a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| and then she did have to take the class again and it wouldn't let her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| because I think hers was almost ready to expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Okay, now is this one of those setups where the hotel guests get a complimentary beer type thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Ms. Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Okay, so on this one the ID wasn't checked this time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| And on the last time the ID was not checked, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| It was the first offense, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Okay, do you guys have the card reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Okay, so that might be something to invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| It's going to be a lot cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Yes, I will be letting my general manager know that as soon as I get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Yeah, so with this being the second offense, you can do the 60-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| or you can take the $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| We will definitely take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Okay, and I hope to not see you guys back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| I promise you we will not be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| I'm going to add in my motion also that we want verification that the class has been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Because, you know, we really take this serious and with a minor being served twice in nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| this is a problem, so let's try to get that straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| So, I'll make the motion that the applicant has taken the $1,500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| and that the bartender will take the class and we will get proof that class has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Could you tell me where we would do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| I know she can't do it online because it wouldn't let us get online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| But do they teach it anywhere downtown where we could send her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Do we have a representative from Metro Drug here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| She will be able to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=624)|

| 0:21:44| Three other fight calls were in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| Two 911 open mic calls with a woman screaming in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1309)|

| 0:22:06| Seven fire calls where fire department went out on a fire alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| and one fire marshal complaint having too many people in the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1329)|

| 0:22:13| We suspended their beer license in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Uh, have there been any calls for service between or it was January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1337)|

| 0:22:22| Has there been any calls for service between then and now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Just the loud music calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| All right, Mr. Beamer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Well, first off, I'd like to point out that my clients haven't been charged with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| These are events that were happening around the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| They cannot control completely the area that they are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| And secondarily, as I, as the state of this board, there's been no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| calls since January, I guess, except for loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| And at that point, they've still had the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| So it's not as if that people have not been able to inebriate themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| So, and also as this board at Horde new manage, the new security had been instituted in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| Um, as far as I can see though, there's no criminal complaints against my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| on any of these behaviors, including underage selling or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| For which I know this board, you know, is very interested in and very takes very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| So at this point, I mean, I believe they're doing the remedial acts that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| They are attempting to do the security measures that they know to keep the area clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| But as far as to the surrounding area that they'll restaurant is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| they can not control the criminal acts of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And nor do I think that anyone can expect a third party to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| the criminal acts of other people in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1433)|
| 0:24:04| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| No, that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Mr. Moyers, would you care to read us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| statute that connects directly with the authority of the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Well, in this particular case, this is under section 4-8 of the county code G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1459)|
| 0:24:30| I think is the most appropriate section says a revocation, suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| or imposition of a civil penalty may be made for any violation of any provision of article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| this article or chapter, or whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that the premises of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| person from a corporation holding a permit under this article are being maintained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| operated in such manners to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Board in considering the suspension or revocation of a permit shall consider repeated violations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| any ordinance or state law involving prohibited sexual contact on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| of an adult-oriented establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| That last sentence doesn't really apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| So, if the board finds that the premises are being operated in a manner that is detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| to the public health, safety, or morals, you may revoke, suspend, or impose a civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Because this is not a question of sales to minors, you are limited under the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| to a $1,000 civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| So, your choices are revocation and suspension, and they have been suspended for approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| 30 days now already, or the imposition of a civil fine of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Before I turn this over to Commission 7, we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| You said that your clients are not responsible for what's going on outside the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| But since 30 days, there's been no problems except for loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| So, that leads me to think that you are the problem, because if not selling the alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| the problem's gone away except for some loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| The minimum I would do is give you another 30 to 60 days and let the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| see that you are doing right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| I think the issue, though, is that they are still selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| They're selling liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| The fact is, most of these complaints all date to pre-October, and there was no doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| that there were acts that occurred near or on the premises, but this is a busy thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| And further, as far as the 911 calls, there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| We don't know if those numbers are coming from the same call or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| so there's nothing we can do about someone calling 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I could call 911 right now in an establishment, and you could then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| hey, he called 911 in that establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| The fact is, this is a business that is trying to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Not selling beer is a major problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Effectively, if this commission wants to put them out of business, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| But they are trying to oblige you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| They're trying to do what they can, and they're willing to pay a civil fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Like I said, they've hired new security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| They are attempting to do different things, but some of these things they cannot control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| This is the business beside the Advanced Auto or the AutoZone, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| Ace Hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Yeah, that's Ace Hardware, that one there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1661)|
| 0:27:41| So, everybody's closed at 11 o'clock midnight, 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| except for your business, and that's when a lot of the calls are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| So, you're drawing them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| There's a draw there for them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| They can come into Ace Hardware at midnight, and they're not coming to Dollar General at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| midnight because they're not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| The only one open is your clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Lieutenant Walker, do they have a dedicated parking lot, or is it part of a strip center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| It's part of the strip center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Okay, but they're on the end of the strip center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Is that it right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| They're in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Oh, and they're in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| I have a question, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| What is the definition of premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| Well, it's the area that's under the control of the beer licensee, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| So, inside the establishment, clearly, is control of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| What happens in the parking lot kind of depends, and whether they have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| dominion over the parking lot kind of depends on what the relationship is with the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Normally, it's a shared parking lot amongst several businesses, so I'd be surprised to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| find that they had any real legal control over what happens in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| So, it becomes difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| If we haven't gotten them for over-serving anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| we haven't gotten them for selling to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| then it becomes problematic to say that we're going to punish them for what happens in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1766)|
| 0:29:36| that they have no control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| I'm assuming that they have no control over the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Now, anything that happens inside the store, inside the restaurant, they're fully responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| So, you get in this gray area of people going into a restaurant, maybe having too much or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| whatever, and they go out in the parking lot where these folks can't do much except run them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| maybe not even that, because they don't have any control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| and things happen out in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| So, it's a difficult circumstance for a licensee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Mr. Moyers, I think the conversation is really about is this a public nuisance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| In a greater sense, if I held a music festival for four days and had a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| and there were 37 DUI calls or DUI stops by the Sheriff's Office after my music festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| even if they didn't have any violations on the premise, clearly those are as a result of my event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| So, obviously, that's a hypothetical, but if I came back the next year for another beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| and the Sheriff's Office said, hey, by the way, because after last year's festival, there were 37| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| pyramids, you would have a serious consideration of whether you would issue them another beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| permit. It would show sort of causation of you're not really controlling or you're creating something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| that is causing a larger public nuisance. And I think this is what we're getting at is we issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| beer permits all the time. And yes, we have violations all the time of somebody didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| check a license. You guys have heard those. You know, somebody made a mistake or somebody was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| intentionally selling to underage minors, and we give civil penalties. But this is a much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| elevated discussion because it's an atmosphere that has elevated to riots or potential riots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1890)|
| 0:31:40| to fights, to sexual assaults. So, there's clearly a causation between the type of business you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| running, the clientele that you have coming there, the amount of alcohol that you're serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| the hours, and then essentially the public disturbance and the potential impact on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| community. And so, you can't just say, well, what's in the walls are within the walls. Otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| you know, we would never, you know, we would be stuck in such a box. So, I think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| we're trying to consider is, are you trying to run a business that is responsible? And do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| value the permit that we're offering, that we hold? I mean, this is a privilege. It's not a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| And it's a privilege to have a beer permit and to operate in a safe manner. And I'll tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| this board puts a lot of stock in our law enforcement officials who don't want to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| their time, you know, all over the county dealing with fights outside the bar. And so, I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| would ask the sheriff's office, you know, you guys do this all the time, all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| Do you feel like this operation is a public nuisance above and beyond the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| service of alcohol and a bar and a restaurant that you, we may, you know, we authorize all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1976)|
| 0:33:05| Sir, you're kind of asking. You got to get right on the mic, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| You're asking for a personal opinion? Well, I'm asking for a professional opinion. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| is what you do. I would point out that since October, they had the three unwanted sexual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| contacts, the rape of a 16-year-old complaint, the mass fight that emptied out our entire night shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| had to come and deal with it. And then three individual fight calls. That's all been since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| October. And then nine, there was nine total loud music calls since October, today's date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2010)|
| 0:33:40| As far as a nuisance and a draw on our manpower, because we are short on patrol, this would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2020)|
| 0:33:48| nuisance and a draw on our manpower based on the facts that I actually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| And I don't, nobody wants to put anyone out of business. We believe in free market and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| commerce, but we also have an obligation for public safety and we have an obligation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| the community in which you operate in. Based on everything I've read, I'm a bit in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| with Commissioner Daley in that I wouldn't mind seeing another 30-day window in which you operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| the business. Loud music is one thing, but if it's, if it seems to be tapering off and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| doing things to help prevent future business, then I think you need to prove it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| further in my opinion. And so just go back to opening up the floodgates. Thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| Frazier. Thank you, Madam Chair. Lieutenant, the calls of the complaints, were those coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| inside of the establishment or outside the establishment or do you know? I mean, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| several. Yeah, the loud music are coming from the community, around the community. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| not inside the bar. They're the residents from outside the area of the bar that apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| the music's so loud that they can't sleep given the hours. The fight calls were started inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2098)|
| 0:35:06| and were escorted out into the parking lot. That's when our officers came in contact. The mass fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| started inside the bar, spilled out into the parking lot. That's when our officers came into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| contact. The unwanted sexual contact where the guy was groping women, that happened inside the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| and I have limited details about the 16-year-old. All I can tell you is because the report is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| classified, I can't look at it. I'm not the detective working the case. All I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| is she claimed it was inside the bar. That's all I can get off the 911 report. Do you have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| to add to that? I would just like to add that interestingly enough, there's no DUI cause or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| any evidence of over serving, which would be also a crime. On the side to that, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| to anything with the juvenile, we are not real, nor have we been served or in any way made parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| to anything in juvenile court. Being that that's a closed proceeding, I wouldn't know anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| I mean, I've got to say I'm deeply disturbed by the activity that's going on in or around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| this establishment, especially when you get into unwanted sexual assault and rape. Those are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2177)|
| 0:36:26| serious and I know that you probably have a side to that story as well, but I tend to agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| my colleagues that this is a much bigger issue and I truly feel like whatever you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2195)|
| 0:36:45| is causing a danger to the general public, to your patrons, and quite frankly to our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| and our other citizens because on more than one occasion, this establishment tied up officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| where they could not respond to other people in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| Would you like to respond? Would anyone like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| Hi everyone. I'm so sorry. My name is Aurora. One of the issues that had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| told about these cases, we were not aware of any of that because never any of the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2238)|
| 0:37:26| in the area came to us to let us know what was going on. We were not aware of any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| They came to us to let us know what was going on or what the people were saying about our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| So if we knew anything about this, we would have to do something because obviously, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| this is something that you cannot keep up with. I mean, I'm not going to keep up with the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| that is going to be disrespectful to either the community, the city, or the state where I'm at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| and I am very happy to inform you that we have enough people to work inside the building trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| to keep everybody comfortable and happy. Like nobody has never complained inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| I've been there several times. Nobody has never come to me telling me that my business is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| something wrong. So you're telling me that you have no knowledge, you had no knowledge of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| things occurring? No, because nobody came to me or to the other owner to tell us that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| going on in our property. Nobody came to tell us that the police had something against us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| because we were not aware of what was going on. If the police officers knew what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| they could have come to us and told us what our business was doing. We could have done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| And they never let us know anything. So and I personally, like one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| outside of the building, I saw the police. They come, they just stop by, they say hi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| we offer them food. We were very friendly to them and they were very friendly to us. They never say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| anything bad about our business, never. So that's why I'm so confused because there are so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| things that he's been saying in here and I'm not saying they're not true. I'm just saying we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| never aware of any of these things, never. Nobody had never come to us to give us a report of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| the police had about us. Lieutenant, is that common practice that you all respond and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| you don't communicate with the establishment's owners? The loud music calls we do, we do contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| the owners and have them turn it down and yeah. And by all the reports that they, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| complaint, the officers responded, turned it down. There was only six repeat calls of the 23. Only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| six had to go back twice to turn down the music. As far as the fights, whether or not the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| went and talked to the owner or not, they were probably dealing with the fight. The security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| was the one that was tossing them out of the bar, so they had to have known that. As far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| three unlawful touchings or sexual contact, the guy was basically groping the women inside the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| and there were three reports made. So the officers had to respond and take the complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| there at the bar. The one fight involved the head of security. The guy actually attacked him in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2411)|
| 0:40:21| bar, so I mean they had to have known that he was the one that made the complaint. So I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| the police were officially reporting it and them knowing about it, I'm finding that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| difficult to believe. Thank you both. Now the rape of the 16-year-old, I can see why they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| not know about that one because it's a 16-year-old and we don't advertise that fact. And I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| recognize you, Commissioner Oster. Was that 16-year-old on the premises? She claims it was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| the premises, yes ma'am. That's all I can get off the 911 report. I do not have access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| official report. All right, thank you. Commissioner Oster. Okay, I think that there's probably a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| glaring problem here that if we have a 16-year-old in the bar, did you let them know that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| a 16-year-old in the bar that has claimed to be raped? I did not. Okay, so we don't know if that 16-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| was inside the premise. We don't know if she had been served alcohol. We don't know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| and they don't know anything. I do not know if she was served alcohol. I know she claimed that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| happened on the premise when the call came in. I know officers responded. They did a police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| A sex crimes investigator was assigned based off the 911 report and that's as much as I have. Would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| that not be, I mean even though she's 16, you're obviously not going to say anything about her name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| or identity, but would that not be something that the owners of that bar needs to know that a 16-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| was attacked in their bar? I'm assuming that the investigator would have gone out and interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| somebody. But they're saying nobody's ever said anything about a 16-year-old being raped. I have no confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| of that one way or the other. That's a problem. Yes ma'am. I mean I kind of agree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| Daly and Commissioner Jay of maybe doing another 30 days. I am happy to see that that you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| kept it in check as far as just loud music. You know that there's not been any other calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| for fights and stuff. But I also agree with Commissioner Frazier that we are short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| staffed and if there was a horrible situation to happen in Knox County, you know our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| don't need to be tied up to dealing with the same thing over and over and over with the same business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| So that's the, you know, that's the issue that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Briefly, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Law Director, are we restricted to a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| suspension or could we make it a 60-day suspension? You have the leeway to make it 60 if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| Okay, thank you. All right. I am sure, Commissioner Lee, that you have plenty to say about this being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| in your district, so the floor is yours. I have concerns on Investigator Walker. You said you're not sure if the owners were notified about these sexual allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2584)|
| 0:43:21| No, ma'am. I just found out about it today when I pulled the 911 report. Okay, so you just found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| out about it today? Yes, ma'am. Their testimony is they didn't know anything about it? I would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| find that hard to believe that the investigators, because it is a 16-year-old, they would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| advertise the fact that they would probably do the forensics on the child first and then wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| for the lab to come back one way or the other, and that could take several months. Okay, so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| you found out about it today. Do you know what the status is? Is that a full investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| going on with that or is that just allegations at this point or are there charges being...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I can only tell you, ma'am, based on the report, and I have it here, you're more than welcome to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| that a complaint was made, officers responded, they did a police report, and a sex crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| investigator was assigned and he did a report. That's all that's logged in the 911 system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| I just have some concerns that nobody knows about this, including the owner. If this had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| happened, why there wasn't questions asked to the owner? So I have a hard time... I'm not doubting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| that this happened, but for them to be able to come in here, they're entitled to due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| They didn't know about these sex crimes, and I don't believe we heard this before either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| and you said you just found out today. Yes, ma'am, when I pulled the 911 reports. Yeah, I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| issues with that, that we're going to penalize them for that when we don't know more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| That's really my biggest comment about that, that we, on the sex crimes, we're just, if the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2690)|
| 0:45:04| doesn't know, we don't know what's going on. At this point, we don't know if these are just false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| allegations or... That's correct, ma'am. Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| Commissioner Lee, do you have a motion to make in regard to this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2717)|
| 0:45:27| I would personally would think that there should be some further, the 30 days, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Commissioner Larson said at least 30 days, just to see how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| 30 to 60 days to see how the continued behavior plays out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| so that we don't shut them down, but they know that they're on their last leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| So I'd make a motion for a 30-day, 60-day, 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| Your motion... Is that in addition to what they already have been under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| Yes. Or is that included? Okay. In addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-beer-board?start=2763)|
