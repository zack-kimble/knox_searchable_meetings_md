| 0:02:56| Scouts that are with us today and I believe you've got a representative who's going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| forward and tell us who you are and share a little bit about why you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=181)|
| 0:03:16| We're Troop 246 from Grace Lutheran Church. What is your name and how old are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| Zachary Medley. I'm 14. Well, thank you all for being here. I appreciate you representing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| group. Are you here for a badge? Well, some of us are here to fill a requirement for a badge, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=206)|
| 0:03:37| All right, well, thank you very much. We appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=217)|
| 0:03:47| Okay, for the Mayor's report. Mayor, I was wondering, can I ask that after the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| report that we move 11-C to the front of this so that we can have our team members come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| be honored and be on their way? Right, we actually have two items that we're going to move up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| and Vice Mayor Pavlis had asked to do it after Council's reports. Okay, so first I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=246)|
| 0:04:16| talk about a couple things. I want to remind everyone that we will be having our annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| budget retreat. The Administration and City Council, it's this Friday, February 7th from 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| to 3 p.m. at the Convention Center. This will be a chance where we review where we are so far. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| midway through the year. And then as we start our budget process for the July 1 fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| we will talk about kind of where we see what our projections are. Of course, Jim York will bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| current financials and what our projections are for ending the year and for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| So we encourage you. I know Council will all be there and encourage anyone else who's interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| to come as well. I, y'all know, I was in Turkey for a week with my granddaughter Jada. Had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| wonderful experience representing. I was there at the invitation of the U.S. Embassy to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| about women and politics. So we were in three cities, Izmir, Ankara, the capital, and Adana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| and then met also with the mayor of Aydin, the mayor of Bornova, and another mayor, the mayor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| Adana, and with numerous political parties, both the ruling party and opposition parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| and women's groups, professors, academicians, all types of people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| and of course with the embassy officials who were with us the whole time. It was a great way to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| our, about the way we function as a city, the way the mayors function in Turkey are a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| different. They're, what they're responsible for is actually different in some places than, or at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| some levels of municipalities than we are, but also just to share both the opportunities that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| all had as women to move up in politics, but also the challenges both in Turkey and still in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| the United States. So, and while I was gone, you all had a major snowstorm, but I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| public service, police, and fire for the excellent way that they prepared and that they responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| I've only heard positive things about that. It was a nice sized storm, so thank you all to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| city employees and to the public for staying off the roads as much as possible. I think it all went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| as smoothly as could be expected. Also, in my absence, there was a major fire, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| and interestingly, I was at a meeting at about 1130 on Saturday at the Incirlik Air Base in Adana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| Turkey, meeting with Tennesseans, actually a couple people from Coryton, Clinton, and other places in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Tennessee, and I got a call from Bill Lyons, and I quickly realized that that would be 430 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| in Knoxville, so I apologized to the group and said I better take this for somebody's calling from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Knoxville at 430 a.m., but so I learned of it when many of you all did that we did have the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| fire at the McClung warehouses. You all know the history on that. That's the city acquired the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| property in November after years of legal wrangling with the previous owner, and we finally were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| purchase it through the bankruptcy trustee, and you all remember the fire that happened in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| that actually three of our firefighters were injured and probably a million dollars worth of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| cost to the city in fighting that fire. I do want to thank Chief Sharp and all of the force who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| there, the firefighters who took care of that blaze. I know they were there all day Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| By the way, Chief Sharp and I were also in contact throughout Saturday on this, and we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| some firefighters there on watch even though the active firefighting is over. Do you want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| to that, Chief Sharp? That's correct, Mayor. We do still have some firefighters on the scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| just in the interest of public safety because of the damage structure that is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| Right. So, today we had our, actually yesterday, Councilman Steyer joined us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| several members on my team went over to the site, and it's my first chance to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| and get an update from Chief Sharp and from our public service department who had been there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| basically raise one of the buildings, and we were awaiting the results of structural engineers who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| came in this morning. We've had the street closed. The property owner, the Sanders Pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| Architecture Office, has had to be temporarily relocated. I understand they've got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| friends at Southeastern Glass who is letting them use some space there, and a resident had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| moved out, and the street remains closed until we decide what can be done or what the integrity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| the remaining structure is. We just met with staff this afternoon just before coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| They had met with, had been on site today with the structural engineers. We will get the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| report tomorrow, but I need to tell you that the building will be razed. It's the way it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| right now. There's no way for public safety. There's just no way to preserve what is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| We've made a courtesy call to Knox Heritage so they will know because I know they had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| interest in this and to some of the neighbors in the area. Certainly this is heartbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| because there had been hope, it wasn't too long ago, that there was like 10 buildings there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| plenty of, there was, the old buildings were there and could have been repurposed, but over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| with the lack of care from the owner at the time, those buildings have continued to deteriorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| and so we have to take action now so that property owners can get back in their offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| and residents can get back in, and we will need to move forward. So we will get the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| report tomorrow, but it's my anticipation that by the end of the week we hope to have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| tear down the rest of those buildings. We will then continue the process of a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| input process for the potential reuse for that space. That is prime real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| We expect to have some real interest from developers on that property, and then we will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| out with an RFP, request for proposals, and then make some decisions on that. We still hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| by the end of the year we will have some interest and be able to turn that property over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| for development to get it back on the tax rolls and get, and add to the, really to the vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| that we have downtown and particularly in the north end of downtown there. So if you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| questions for Chief Sharp or any of us at this time, we'd be glad to answer them. If not, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| that's fine. You know where to find us, but we will be sending out a press release to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| the, stating that we intend to raise that building based on the results of the structural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| assessment. Okay, so I think that is the end of my report. Any reports from Council? Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| Stair? Thank you, Mayor. That's certainly terrible news for Knoxville and downtown. The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| announcement I had is that the Public Property Naming Committee is going to be meeting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Thursday at 5.30. So those of you on the committee, please attend and let anybody know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| that's interested. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis? Well, I don't have a report. I would, if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| proper, I was going to go ahead and make the motion if we could suspend the rules to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Resolutions B and C to the forefront. Is there a second? Second. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? We will move those up. And the first one is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=729)|
| 0:12:19| to honor the memory of Harold Woods. And Ms. Mitchell, would you please read that resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Do you have that? Yeah, I think that would be proper. Let's pull it up for you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=744)|

| 0:24:08| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah, I, you know, obviously I had some other thoughts about how this should, should work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| and I am going to offer up, I'm not going to get on top of the table, but I am going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| to offer up an amendment to, to this as I did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| I mean, let me just, you know, just very briefly, I mean, this has been an ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| process since, I think, 08 and, and I understand there's been fault on both sides, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| they couldn't get the information and then we had a lot of transition and, and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| and board members and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| So for whatever reason, they've gotten what they feel like is behind, behind like cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| and I think that they should get a fair wage, number one, for what it is they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| But it, let me say, it's, it's not mandatory that they be in this rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| It's a choice that they have and I'm not exactly sure how long the contracts are for, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| think they're, you know, very capable of figuring out if they can make money on this or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| make money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| But with that being said, and I want to offer an amendment to where we could go over a three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| period, go 10%, 10% and 10%, which gets them 5% more than they've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| I think it's fair for the consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I mean, what I've heard and since we read this the first time, a lot of people, I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| say outraged, but a lot of people, it raised eyebrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| You all probably heard some as well, that it's a 25% increase is a lot to swallow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| a consumer all in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| So, again, you know, it gets them 5% more and then, you know, we can revisit it, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| know, at the end of that time and keep moving forward, but at a lesser rate of an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| making it more palatable for the consumers that have to pay these rates at those unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| times when they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| So that's my amendment and I'll rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Is there a second to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| So, any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| So we will vote first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Is it clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| It's 10, 10 and 10 over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| So all in favor of the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1583)|

| 0:28:00| Christy, we're talking about new buildings and additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Would you tell us how this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| This particular ordinance was just a cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| There were some issues with interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| It was to provide a better explanation to the builders about exactly what's being required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And there was also a couple of tables that had gotten reversed, so we just straightened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| It's a cleanup ordinance, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Well, I was just wondering, what happens, for example, if someone adds to a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Do they have to go back and re-insulate the original part, or is it only for new construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| It depends on the size of the renovation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| So you would consult the Director of Permits and Inspections, and they could help advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| 10A is an ordinance to close a portion of an unnamed alley from North Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| to Ogden Street, and authorizing the Mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Jeffrey Nash, applicant, on appeal from a denial by MPC, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| That's a move to grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Well, I just wanted to ask, I guess Mark Donaldson, there was some indication in the notes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1754)|
| 0:29:23| Mr. Nash did not come to your meeting, and that sort of affected the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Could you fill us in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| That, in fact, is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Staff had no information about the proposed development on that block, and really were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1776)|
| 0:29:46| uncomfortable in making a recommendation for approval of the closure without any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| to base it on, fully expecting that the applicant would be at the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| to make the case, and Mr. Nash was not there, so it was relatively easy for the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| Commission to go with the staff recommendation then to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Has new information been provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| We've been given something here, and I don't know whether the MPC has seen it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| I received a handout from Mr. Nash this evening, and I met with other owners on the block yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| so I am now fully appraised of what they have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Do you have an opinion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| It's very similar to the case that UT made with the closing of the public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| on campus, in that they really have in mind a pedestrian-oriented throughway that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| replace the alley in its current condition and enhance it while maintaining access through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| There will be a sewer easement that remains in place, so they can't build over that anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| but as I understand it, they're proposing to orient new residential units onto that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| space and enhance it greatly, so I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| So it becomes a people thoroughfare instead of just an alley, is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| I mean, a walking area through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Mr. Nash, you want to give us a minute's worth of what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| I'd really like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Jeffrey Nash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Jeffrey Nash, 129 South Central Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| I'd like to apologize to MPC for not having turned up at their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| It was a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| They are 100% right, I should have been there and I should have provided them with further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| and better information so they had a better idea as to what it was we planned on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| to that particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| We acquired that site in June of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Our intentions are to redevelop both the parking lot and the old master battery building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| into residential retail and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| We're doing this in conjunction with Dewhurst Properties and partners who own the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| half of the block and who will be sharing with the actual closure of the alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| We would like to make a secure area there in order to attract tenants in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| We genuinely believe that we need to offer them some kind of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| That's exactly why we're looking for some kind of closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I hope that MPC are now satisfied with what it is we've put before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| By closure, do you mean that traffic, vehicle traffic won't go through but pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| can go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Or just the tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| It will just really be for the tenants who occupy the entire block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| An interior walkway and it looks like you have a little garden area pictured or depicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Mr. Nash, I just wanted to ask, one of the couple of points that were brought up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| like deliveries and trash service, is that going to be available for a vehicle or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| you have plans for like a trash receptacle somewhere near there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Yes, we have availability for trash collection on Magnolia Street and that particular trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| collection will service all of the residential and the retail part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I just wanted to say if you look at the history of this particular property, there used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| be a nuisance business there some years ago across from the Greyhound bus station and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| I think we need to support Mr. Nash and his efforts to revitalize that particular part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| It's very well needed and I'm definitely going to support him in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| So we have a motion and a second to grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2050)|

| 0:35:56| had another building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| It was unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| It had a lot of heavy-duty stuff in it, but it was unoccupied at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So anyway, they've been working to renovate that block in support of what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| there along with the Southern Depot renovation and several other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| So they've applied for a pilot to get support to make this development happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| It's roughly a $6 million investment on their part, $1.3 million looking at owner's equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| The request is for a 10-year pilot, which would hold the current taxes at the same rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| that they are for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| One reason we're doing 12 instead of 10 is IDB wants people to, when you all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| this, it goes to IDB, and then if IDB approves it, they would like for people to close within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| three months of the time that they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| What's been happening is you would approve it, they would approve it, you would get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| the construction period, and then they would kind of close on the pilot, but now they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| to set this up to where you close almost immediately after it's approved, and so the benefit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| this is actually just going to be for 10 years because the first 18 months to two years will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| be under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| There will be no improvements or taxes raised at that time, so that's why it's a 12-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| instead of a 10-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| So, I hope that kind of answers some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I'd be happy to answer others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| He may have answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| I wanted to know why it wasn't 10 years and why it was being stretched out, and you sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| of run in place a bit for 18 months, I guess, is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Yeah, it just takes a while to renovate the property and get it fully stabilized with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| tenants paying rents and have that new value accrue that we're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And the new value obviously doesn't show up until you finish the building, so that's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| So, we're trying to get this – we're trying to clean up our procedures a little bit through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| the IDB with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| They've requested us go in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Now, it says up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Does that mean that they can finish sooner and we get our money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| This would be – unlike TIFs, this is for a 12-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| If it's a TIF and they pay off earlier, then it's over quicker, but this will be up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Or they could come out of the lease at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| They could choose to come out of the lease with the IDB at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| I doubt they'll do that, but they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2285)|

| 0:39:05| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| I am the surveyor for this site right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| We were contracted about six months ago to go out and perform the survey at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| In the course of our survey, we discovered that the previous survey that was prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| about four or five years ago actually had mislocated the center line of Tillery Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| With the thoroughfare plan, they then offset or dedicated a set amount of right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| I think it's 30 feet there over to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| And what ultimately happened was is they dedicated more right-of-way than was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| When we came back in six months ago and did our survey, we discovered that error from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| the previous survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I have met with Ben Davidson, the city surveyor on this issue, on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| We've surveyed the area, surveyed the other side of the street, and was able to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| that our survey is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| So what we're doing is basically providing what the thoroughfare plan requires for Tillery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| Road at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| I guess Jim is here, Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Could you tell us, there was some commentary in the I guess before MPC about there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| issues with the intersection and it might have to be widened, and are we giving back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| this right-of-way and then going to turn around and buy it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Where are we on road issues related to that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| We have no plans to widen that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| There would be some, there would presumably be some benefit to that, but this would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| be enough right-of-way by itself to accomplish that, and there's a whole lot of other intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| out there in the city that we would probably do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| So chances are fairly slim that we would need that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| All right, and I take it you're in concurrence that this is more of a technical cleanup than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Yes, I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| All right, well thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I recently met with the North Norwood Homeowners Association, Councilman Stair was also there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| and there were a number of questions about that intersection of Tillery and Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| and the need for substantive improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| And so I'm concerned that while this will clean up a past sin, we will end up in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2502)|
| 0:41:52| not a year, because obviously if there's nothing on the horizon, it'll take longer, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| will end up buying this piece of property and additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So for that reason, I'm going to be voting against this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| Okay, we do not yet have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Okay, now we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=2537)|

| 0:51:07| I'll try to get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| I would call it a flat plan, which involves 50 condos and or apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3068)|
| 0:51:18| Refining the plan would give better architectural perspectives on it and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| There's a great deal of difference between what they can do with 5.99 units, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| essentially 30 units on the property, or with 50 units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| That affects the amenities, the ability to do sidewalks off-site, and issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3098)|
| 0:51:47| Also the composition of the building, they can, with 50, they could do brick buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| brick exterior buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| If at 30, probably you're going to get some vinyl on the buildings, rather than the brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3115)|
| 0:52:04| There are issues like that that can be defined better by architectural assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Okay, now speaking against the ordinance, we have Wayne Klein and Jack Sherrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| So Mr. Klein, if you'd like to start, and you have up to five minutes, and please state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Good evening, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I am Wayne Klein from the law firm of Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| I'm here on behalf of a large number of homeowners and homeowners associations as their spokesperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| to speak out against what is being requested here by your applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| That includes the Wellesley Park Homeowners Association, the Cherokee Place Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Association, the Glenn Ives Homeowners Association, the estates of Wellesley Park, the villas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| of Wellesley Park, the residents of Winchester Drive, the residents of Cleveland Park, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| residents of Glenn Ives, the residents of Dean Hill Subdivision, and Winchester Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| If you're here in opposition, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| I heard the request for, you can sit down folks, I heard the request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| I'll address that very simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| We're not here about an architectural design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| We're here about a density issue, and the density issue as you understood from Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| is between what my clients would approve, would welcome, which would be an RP1 density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| of 5.99, which is consistent with the applicable sector plan, the one year plan, which all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| says low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Low density residential is 5.99 per acre, and that's what we would accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| All of the dwellings and the homeowners units, the subdivisions out there, including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| condo parks are all at 5.99 dwelling units per acre or less, and so it doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| to postpone this if we're only going to come back here because somebody wants to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| architectural design for the next six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Architectural design can be talked about in the planning stage for use on review later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| on, but it's not appropriate here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| We've been here for, in essence, nine months, 13 months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| I've been down here three times, been to MPC several times in opposition, and beyond our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| opposition, we have before you the staff recommendation by MPC, which is consistent with what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| accept, and that is to deny the high density residential one year plan amendment that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| been applied for, because approval of medium or high density development at this site would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| be a spot plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Spot plan zoning is illegal, as you all know, and I think Mr. Donaldson and I agree on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| for once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| We recommend that you deny anything more than 5.99 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3324)|
| 0:55:34| The one year plan amendment, the rezoning requirements, all require certain criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| None of the criteria that are here for the one year plan amendment or for rezoning requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| are being met by this application, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| And so, folks, it doesn't make sense to move forward with this request because it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3351)|
| 0:56:00| meet the applicable sector plan, it doesn't meet the requirements of the one year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And we could go into detail and be here for hours about what it requires, but none of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| those criteria have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So I'd ask you all to deny your applicant's request and not postpone this for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Mr. Sherrod, name and address, please, for the record, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| Jack Sherrod, 7116 Dean Hill Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| I'm the one that's been sending you all the e-mails, and I apologize if it's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| My only concern is this is my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| I'm not worried about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I don't know where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I have never mentioned property values to anybody, and I've been the catalyst for everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| I've had these people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| This is the second time I've had them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| In November, they canceled, they pulled their proposal at 5 o'clock when I had all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| people lined up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| This is really not a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| You know, they ended up moving, somehow they moved their whole project to within less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| a quarter of a mile at best from Westtown Mall, and I can tell you I drove it, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| more than one mile, less than one quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| It just feels like to us that this is our home, and we have so many people, the butlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| have lived there for 35 years, and we just feel like it's an invasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| We don't mind Knoxville to have progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| We really want it to have progress because over time we're hoping, we've met with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| mayor and some of y'all have come, we're hoping for some improvements to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| But it's easy to say it's only four units per acre, but this opens up the rest of Dean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Hill Drive to the same ten units medium density, and I own 4.5 acres, and I could make an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| I've already, the guy that's developing my property next door to me has already proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| that we combine our property and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| But I'm 68 years old, and I've lived there since 1987, and I would like to spend my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| there, the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And to say I'm upset about the increase in density is a small thing, and I hope I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3496)|
| 0:58:25| alienated any of y'all with my emotion, but I grew up in poverty in East Knoxville, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| I worked really hard to get where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And to have somebody want to come in and put 7,500 more cars, it won't be their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| but then I'm going to have to move the two pieces of property next door to me have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Bill Etherton died several years ago, and Mrs. Etherton is 92 years old, and her son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| Steve, is taking care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| That property is for sale now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| And the Zalone property is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| I've been offered mine several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| If I put mine up for sale, those three pieces of property will sell within 90 days because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| the two other ones have been held up for mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| And then all these neighbors will have 7,500 more cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| I sent you all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| It's not just four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| It's a 67% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| It will be 7,500 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| If you take one-third of that and it goes to 5.99, it will only be 2,500 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| The truth is I would rather it stay like it is, but that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| And I would like to see 5.99 progress for us to get Dean Hill built up so that you guys are comfortable spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| some money to repair our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| The drainage is bad, and there's lots of things bad about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| And there's probably not enough money being brought in now to justify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| But their proposal to me is just a way to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| And we live there, and I can't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| We sat in our driveway and waited for 15 cars to go by just to pick up Mrs. Smith, who rode with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| And to me, it's sad that I might have to move into the county to get peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| And anyway, thank you all for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| And, Mayor, thanks for the meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| It was really great for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Mark, would you give a little light about spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| I know that your staff recommended 5.99, and that's been the recommendations all along for this property along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| But you had mentioned about spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Would you explain that in this particular situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| Well, spot zoning is frowned upon by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| State law and local zoning ordinance both require that zoning decisions be made consistent with the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3658)|
| 1:01:07| including the future land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| The principles of spot zoning kind of apply to plan amendments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| You have to have a certain criteria to amend a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Staff kind of likes the pattern of zoning that has occurred along the south side of Dean Hill now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3681)|
| 1:01:32| within the low-density residential land use framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| but at a reasonable amount to encourage some infill development in the five to six units per acre range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3697)|
| 1:01:47| This particular property is surrounded on all four sides by low-density residential zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| and about a quarter of a mile to the development at Wellesley Park that has much greater density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3714)|
| 1:02:05| So it would be a spot of other than low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| should that occur with medium-density residential land use plan classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3733)|
| 1:02:21| and zoning at up to ten units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| It would be different than all of the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| Council, I know normally that we give courtesy to an applicant if they do ask for an extended amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| but I think you've heard that and I've worked with both sides on this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| And it seems like that's why I asked Mr. Seymour whether or not they were going to come back with 5.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| if they were going to revamp the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| And their plan is still to use ten units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| In talking with the neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| some of the neighbors, of course, would like to have the property stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| But I think they've come together all along Dean Hill Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| and say that we understand there's going to be development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| We understand that this property is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| And so we're willing to go with the 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| We're willing to go with what MPC staff has recommended for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| So in my own mind, I'm not sure that we're going to make any headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| We're going to be right back here in six weeks or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| And Mr. Seymour is going to be talking about ten units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| and the neighborhood groups are going to be talking about 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| So I think we ought to make a decision tonight and take care of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I appreciate your comments about the fact that there may not be a resolution down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| but it has been the practice of this council as long as I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| to try to get two sides to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| And sometimes we have, I think, left here thinking there will be nothing good come of this extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| And then everybody comes back, and lo and behold, there's been some positive movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| So I think it is incumbent on this council to approve the request for an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| so that we can see if some movement can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| I would also ask that if meetings are going to be held with the neighborhood or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| that everyone on council be made aware of this in time to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| because there have apparently been some meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| and all of council was not aware that this was occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| and yet we're all here to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| And it might have made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| It might have not made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| But I do think it's incumbent that, in consideration of the Sunshine Laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| and also in consideration of us all having the same amount of information, that be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So I would be supporting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Yeah, I'd like to dovetail off Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| I mean, I hate that folks have come out on a rainy, cold night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| and, you know, it has a possibility of getting postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| I don't know for where it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| But I, too, I mean, I've seen these things where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| they say there's no way it could work, and then, lo and behold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Palmer says they come back and they found common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| I think the thought of a appraiser is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I mean, I think that that would give me assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I lived in Glen Ives for two and a half years, and I've lived what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3925)|
| 1:05:34| And it was, you know, difficult, I guess, to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| But I moved there because I wanted to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| closer to the things that my wife and I enjoyed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| And I love living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I live about 150 miles, yards from Alcoa Highway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| The gentleman mentioned 15 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| It takes me 15 minutes to turn left in the mornings to get to my office in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| So, you know, I can appreciate the traffic concerns in those cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| On Dean Hill Drive, sometimes they may have been going 70 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| I mean, they do move up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| But I'll assure you, Alcoa Highway, they're going a minimum of 70 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| So I can appreciate where you're coming from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But, you know, I just maybe give it one more shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| I mean, it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| And, you know, Mr. Smith and Mr. Chase are longtime residents of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| They've contributed in a lot of different ways back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| and I don't think that they want to put anything in there that would be detrimental to Knoxville or to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| So I'm at least willing to go, you know, for the postponement one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| And then I think we need to find the end of it, if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| I would concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| I'd come with a motion we postpone it until March 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| So that is our motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Yeah, I'm sitting here listening to the council speak, but Mr. Klein and the neighbors make a very important point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4030)|
| 1:07:19| and that is what good does it do for them to sit back and watch an appraiser find a way to say that adding a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4039)|
| 1:07:30| density to what is really a single family residential area is not going to affect their property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| or the desirability to live there and the capacity of the roads to carry the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| It seems to me that making the facades and materials more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| and trying to prove that the value won't be affected that much by changing the tenor of that single family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| that's covered by the sector plan, that's covered by the one-year plan, that's covered by the growth pattern out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| it seems like we're being courteous to the developer, but we're not making any progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| And I didn't hear anything from their side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| I'd invite them to tell us that when they go back, they're going to look at less density, because the issue of whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| medium density or low density is the focal point of the dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| And I don't hear anything from their side saying, we're going to go back and look at low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| They're going to go back and look at how they can make it look a little more attractive on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| different architectural renderings, and try to come up with an appraiser who will look at this and say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| it's really going to enhance their value or it's going to be neutral, and going to try to persuade them that there's not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| The reality is these folks are going against the grain of the planning system and the type of neighborhood that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4132)|
| 1:09:01| you know, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| The folks are willing to live with higher density than they've got now, and that's apparently not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| So I don't expect any progress between now and March 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| I'll be opposing extension unless they come up and tell us they're going to lower their density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Again, that was going to be my question, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| In this planning process or what you want for the next six weeks, are you willing to reduce to 5.99,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| which is what the neighborhood MPC staff has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| We don't think I can say we will reduce to 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| We will consider that, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| We will consider anything between that and ten units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| That's one thing we want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| If you want us to say tonight we will agree to 5.99, I cannot say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4194)|
| 1:10:04| I can say we will look at all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Vice Mayor Pavlov?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| And that's my whole point in that, you know, I've seen this happen a dozen times in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| he's not able to speak for his client in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| I wouldn't assume that you would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| At times I've been sitting here, you can't say definitely that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| But I know that I've seen folks come back after they think they're at the end of the rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| And lo and behold, they found something else that, you know, would work financially and otherwise for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| They found common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| So, you know, I'm willing to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| I mean, I don't know that it will pass when you come back if it's still 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| You sound like you may have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| But I would just like to give it one more shot to see if y'all can find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| I understand what you're saying, too, Councilman Delvaux, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| But I've seen it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| Councilman Wallace, let me just clarify your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| You've made the motion to postpone until March the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| And is that for J, K, and L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| It's all three matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Yes, all three matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| So we have a motion to postpone for six weeks, J, K, and L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Are you all ready to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Councilman Delvaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| So is there a motion to approve the ordinance as listed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4311)|
| 1:12:00| Does that mean what MPC did or not did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| An appeal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| No, this is not an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| This is an ordinance to approve the amendment to the West City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Or to make it medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| I can't call on you, sir, unless one of the council members do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| I'd like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| What I'd like to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Please state your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| What I'd like to do is, since we can't postpone, go ahead and show the opposition and show all you all both sets of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| One at 5.99 units per acre and one at 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| And it shows a difference of 20 units per acre or 20 units total that I'd be more than happy to hand to each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| If that would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4367)|
| 1:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| This is your current plan or just two plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Two different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Two different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4392)|
| 1:13:32| Are these the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| We've got six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| City Council, the first page shows a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Do you have any extra copies, sir, so that we don't have to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Here's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Someone can have mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Anybody need one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I've got one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Were they duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| City Council, the first page shows you the 5.9 units per acre or six units per acre as it shows at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| A total of 30 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And what it shows is because the economics of 30 units, what we'll be building is the same thing we built all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| We built multiple locations throughout Knoxville, Belterra, Andy's Road, and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| These duplexes right here, they'll be vinyl siding because we'll only have 30 units per acre or 30 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| We won't be able to do the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| There'll be no walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| We can't do a sidewalk to the Dean Hill Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| The units will be cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Rents will be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| There'll be minimum landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Just the economics of doing the 5.9 units per acre doesn't make sense on a developer standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| and it doesn't make sense for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| We're still debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| There's a duplex there that sits on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| We're still debating if we're going to keep that, and that duplex was built in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| But you can see the pictures of the units we plan to build behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And if you turn, keep flipping through there, you'll see the next proposed unit or proposed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4498)|
| 1:15:06| and it shows 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Ten units per acre is 50 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| We're talking about 20 units more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Twenty units more will allow us to do a pool, a pavilion, an amenity package, walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| a $30,000 sidewalk that will connect from this property all the way to Dean Hill Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| It will have an abundance of landscaping where you, when you're driving down Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| you won't even be able to see the units behind all the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| These homes will be all brick, all stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| The rents will be a premium of $1,200 a month, and the city tax revenues will be maximized on this five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| This will be a first class development by two families that have given a lot to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| and we're talking about 20 units more per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I've heard, I understand the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| I understand they want 5.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| And if that's what they, if that's what city council approves, then you see our first development on the first page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| with vinyl siding units and less rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Has this been presented to Mr. Klein in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| No, and that's what we wanted to do during the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Why did you wait until tonight to present this to the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| This thing has been going on for months, weeks, months, and you wait until now to present this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| Well, the first time it went on for months is because Councilman Greaves told us to keep postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| because we wanted to have both tracts of land together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| And now we're to the point where they, Mr. Klein, argued in front of MPC last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| that their biggest heartache was property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| So we immediately called an appraiser and we're waiting to get that appraisal back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| So it's been just an ongoing process from there that we're trying to get this to the, in front of them to show them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| that it's either these 30 units and 5.9 units per acre or these 10 units or 50 units at 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| When did you have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| We've had this since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| When we came back and we've talked to other city council and we've talked to staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| we went ahead and laid out after MPC 5.9 units per acre to go ahead and show city council exactly what 5.9 units per acre will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4636)|
| 1:17:26| And now that we would like the postponement to show this to opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| So essentially you've come up with a really, really nice development for 10 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and a really, really lousy development for 6 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| You're showing it to them now, the night of the vote, to us, the council, to the council that's going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4659)|
| 1:17:49| It's borderline absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And this has been going on for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| And I agree with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| I mean, you all have a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| But you're all, you're all going to have to take in both sides of the argument and come to a fair conclusion what is best for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| If I put this in their hands immediately, they were going to come up with another argument, I suppose, why they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| They just don't want us in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| But it was almost like, you remember when you're young arguing with your dad and your dad says, you know what, it's going to be this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| And you'll understand when you're older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| They will understand in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| They'll come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| I'll come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| And you'll be proud of this development at 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Well, I'll let Mr. Klein speak on behalf of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| But, I mean, at least personally, I don't know what the rest of council feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| We like to have as much information as we can as early as possible to evaluate these things that we have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4713)|
| 1:18:41| And to hand something out like this to me is very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| And I'd like to call on Mr. Klein to see what his response is to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| My response is this is a facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| It's a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Nobody has ever come to me and tried to talk and ask on behalf of these folks if we could have some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4740)|
| 1:19:08| In fact, what happened, and let's put it into perspective, was your applicant came before MPC and asked for 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| When their time allotment expired and it failed, they came back and asked for 25 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| And that's the application you have before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| I think this is a sham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| And I am not proud to be part of this because I haven't heard from these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| We haven't had discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| And yet tonight we get this, which is a black and white, 30 total homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| It's a threat to you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| It's a threat to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Development like this should not lead like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| We lead by the sector plans that we all talk about, that we invest our time and energies in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| We lead by the one-year plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| We lead by low-density residential single-family development in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| And for them to come in now and try to put this on you is a sham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| That's my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Mark, again, if you would, maybe for additional clarification, your staff recommended 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4817)|
| 1:20:28| Would you go through that a little bit again in terms of not so much the spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| but just the fact of what really needs to happen in this particular area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| Well, if you look at the existing development pattern along Dean Hill from Winchester to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4841)|
| 1:20:52| you see a variety of housing types but a fairly constant zoning pattern in that on the south side of Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| the zone districts are generally planned residential, RP1, at between five and six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4860)|
| 1:21:09| Immediately to the north, the property across Dean Hill is zoned 5.9 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| And the property to the west on Winchester is zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| And the land use plan reflects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| There is a sea of yellow color that we use for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| We don't see any reason to put a spot of darker color at this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| It's not at an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| It's not at a point where we're trying to create a node of higher intensity and higher density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| Frankly, the zoning pattern along the south side of Dean Hill is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| and a pretty good example of what you can do with infill development under the low-density land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4918)|
| 1:22:08| How long has that area been zoned low-density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| Well, it's the land use plan that's classified low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| and we updated the West City sector plan back in probably 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| It was low-density before that, and it came out of the sector plan update the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| We have added some medium and high-density residential up in the Wellesley Park area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| where they have access to Morrell as well as access to Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| But that is a fair distance from this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| So it's had the same land use classification for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| Well, I know in reading the report and having talked with you before that it just seems to me that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| along with the recommendations of the MPC staff, that the low-density ought to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| We've got some additional vacant land in there that could have additional units put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| and I think there's a good reason to leave it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| We get falsely accused of chasing tax dollars all the time up here, and I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| I mean, this is what's right is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| On this zoning, 5.99 is consistent, and I'm not going to be swayed by architectural pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5016)|
| 1:23:46| that show it other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| That's not what we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| We're not here to vote on design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| We never have been, and we're here to vote on the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| And it was land use on all the other properties we voted on, and it's about the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| What's the proper land use for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| We're not here in the design business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Do I want to see all frame and vinyl siding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| And I think the neighbors won't either, but I don't think you also want to see the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| And there's just no way to even strike an argument why it would be greater than 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5052)|
| 1:24:21| But if you wanted to zone it more than that, then the rest of the properties on Dean Hill are going to fall right with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| But there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| There's not anything you can throw a rock to and get higher than the high-density apartments across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| I supported a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I supported more time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| And I just can't support anything more than 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Okay, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Where we are now is if you support the ten dwelling units per acre, then I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| I am saying this, that we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| So there is no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| So unless you make a motion to approve this, then this will fail for the lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| Does anyone wish to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| We can make a motion to move it to 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| It will be 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| It already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| So this does not require a motion if you want to keep it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| We have three actions in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| The first two deal with land use plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| That's different than the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| So the ordinances, the first two, J and K, are to amend the sector plan and the one-year plan from LDR to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5132)|
| 1:25:42| And then it's only the third item that gets to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| So if you want to keep it low-density residential as it currently is, either deny the ordinance or make no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5146)|
| 1:25:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Well, that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Technically, the rezoning is on the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| But if you don't want to make any changes, then you don't make a motion for any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| You are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| First, we're dealing with the west sector plan, then the one-year plan, and then the actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| So is there a motion for item J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| There being none, then that fails for lack of a motion, which also makes K and L then fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5184)|
| 1:26:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Yeah, they become moot because you can't you're not allowed to rezone in a way that's inconsistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| I would have a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| The sector plan is currently LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| LDR allows a zoning district up to 5.99 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| That recommendation is on the table through staff's recommendation if council wants to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| The property is currently zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| And you're saying what, R1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| RP1 at up to 5.99 units to the acre is consistent with the low-density residential and use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| If that's what you're saying, Mr. Law Director, then what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| So now just go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| The K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| See if they want to make a motion on K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| So for K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Which is the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| The one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| One-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| I think Mark is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Fails for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| And then L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Mark, are you saying that L could be RP1 at the lower density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| It is currently R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| And there could be a motion to make it RP1 at 5.99?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Mayor, can I ask something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| I'd like to ask Mr. Seymour, is your client interested in an RP1 zone on that property without the density change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| In other words, do we need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Councilman Dellavopi, it gives us more flexibility on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Otherwise, we'd just have to chop it up and stick houses on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| So RP1 has that utility of being able to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| I didn't know if you were standing up before to tell us you weren't interested in that or whether that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| It's just that we were battling the density battle, but this RP1 enables you to lay it out, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| in a way that's economically more desirable to your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Can we hear from Mr. Kline also that the neighborhoods agree to 5.99?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| Well, we would agree to 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| The question then becomes, would we agree from an R1 to an RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| And we've said all along that we're supporting staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| We're not going to stop right now and be inconsistent or bring anything to you tonight that we haven't talked to you about for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| So we've heard from them that they want to move to an RP1 5.99 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| That's an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| So now we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| This is on L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| We have a motion to rezone to RP1 at 5.99 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| A motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| Can I ask the law director, since MPC was recommending that as a staff level, we're within the zone of doing what they recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| That's something they considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| You could do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| So it's a motion to amend L to RP1 at 5.99 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| So we've just amended it and now we're back to the original ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| Did we have a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Everybody clear on what just happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| 12M is an ordinance approving the request of Shane Addington for an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| Northwest City Sector Plan from low-density residential to office for property located on the southwest side of Shubert Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| southeast of Merchant Drive, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| No, I don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| I mean, considering what we just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| I mean, if we look at staff recommendations, you know, we've got to draw the line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| And, you know, no offense to this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| He's right in a gray area and it just doesn't make sense to continue to encroach and encroach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| onto the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| And so I'm, you know, we need to uphold the staff recommendation to deny the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| So we're on M, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Which has to do with the Northwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| And there's no motion from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| I don't know if, is the gentleman here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Sir, are you Mr. Addington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Shane Addington, 5601 Cheswood Drive, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| I thought that I was under the impression that when we came to the MPC meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| the motion or the recommendation was to change to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| That was from the commission body, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| The staff itself didn't support your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| I would only like to add that I've talked to the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| There was no opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| I've owned the property for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| The property already looks as if it were office or commercial property because of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| the drive and the paving is done and because of everything up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| And also because of the shopping center that butts up to it on the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| It's over the years made it extremely hard since I moved out to keep it leased as residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| So this was strictly for an improvement and also welcomed by the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| It's office space, everything up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| And as a matter of fact, I don't know if it's recognized, but as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| even across the road, it's being used as a counseling center as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| I talked about that with the MPC, and they said that it wasn't recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| But that is the use of it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| And everything up to it is for the same use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And like I said, because of the commercial that's behind it, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| It makes it very, very hard for me to lease and keep leased as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| So I would ask that you change your mind and vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Well, I don't have much to add other than, like I say, it's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| Commercial meets residential all over the city, and, you know, a buffer needs to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| He's got a little bit more aggressive zoning to where he can have a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| And again, it's an attractive building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I don't deny that, but I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| There is no motion, so that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| So what's the impact then on N and O, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| I really believe that's going to moot it, but I'll defer to Mark on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| In this case, it makes the other two moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| So both M, N, and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| And there's Mr. Addington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| I can't call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| I'm happy to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Go ahead, Mr. Addington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| I only had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| If I could in any way appeal this or if I would have to go through the process all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5670)|
| 1:34:39| Well, I would suggest that you consult with a lawyer, but the appeal that follows this is in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| and there's a standard of review that might be a problem for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| So going through it again would probably be easier than going to court with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| But you ought to consult with your lawyer about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Sir, you also MPC rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| If you choose not to file or consult with an attorney and file suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| you can reapply within one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| You can file again immediately if you request a different type of zoning than this one that you did apply for, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| I mean, I know at this point if the other two fall moot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| there's not a motion to approve that it's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| I would only ask that if any of the council have seen the property and understand where I'm coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| it's noted very easily that it's a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| I would only at this point beg the council to recognize that the possibility to go for office there is so needed in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5746)|

| 1:36:21| We have one person signed up, Mr. Bruce White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Please give us your name and your address and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| My name is Bruce White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| I'm from Kegel Terrace at 515 Renford Road, Apartments B, 514.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5794)|
| 1:36:43| I have an issue with the KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| This has to do with the auditing of our residential accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| And from what I have read with the contract with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| that all accounts are to be audited and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| And what we have experienced with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| I had spoken to them about some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| And we have situations where bylaws appear to not be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| We have missing records and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| And right now there is an investigation going on by KCDC because of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| However, the investigation has been going on for nearly five months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| They still haven't found anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| And now with an investigation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| they want to go ahead and have an election of board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| And they don't even know if anyone is guilty of anything or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| And I would like the city to look into whether or not these audits are actually required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5865)|
| 1:37:53| It seems like they should be because they are required to be on the financial statements for KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| So why wouldn't they be required to be audited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| I would just like some confirmation from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| If this is to be audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| then, you know, if the city could let KCDC know that we need to audit these records every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5890)|
| 1:38:17| And if they're not, then I would certainly like to see a copy of the law someplace that says it's not to be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| because no one can find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| I believe that Mr. Law Director, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| Well, I would simply have to say that KCDC is an independent agency created by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| but it has become an independent agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| And they do have legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| I will talk to their legal counsel about the issue you raised tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| and make sure that there is not some legal problem that they're overlooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| But we have to allow their board and their legal counsel to make the legal decisions for KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| Even if there is a city code that with, you know, in conjunction with their contract that requires them to audit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5942)|
| 1:39:14| Well, probably not, but there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| If you want to speak more after this meeting, I'm sure Mr. Swanson would be glad to talk to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| But thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| And, counsel, there's no further business, so this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140204?start=5967)|
