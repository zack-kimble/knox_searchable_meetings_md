| 0:00:03| We have a motion before us that has had a friendly attachment added, which is the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=3)|
| 0:00:12| request to hire our outside counsel along with the friendly amendment, which is specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| to this particular lawsuit that was brought against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| We've discussed that at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| We're going to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:26| After that, we'll have a ten-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| All in favor of the motion, I'm sorry, go ahead, Renee, do you have a roll, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but I just need to procedurally understand, once that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| what procedurally is our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=44)|

| 0:00:54| I guess what I would ask would be for Mayor Jacobs and his staff to, either through writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| to communicate to the county commission if this passes, next steps, and do their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| on hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Is that amenable to the Mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=68)|

| 0:24:22| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| At your discretion, we've got the one item, which is the amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance, which was on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| I'd like to move that up to the top of the agenda for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| I know we've got a lot of interested parties in that one who are here tonight, and with as long as this meeting has been going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| at least for that group, I would like to see if we can go ahead and knock that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| It is here tonight for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| I know many of us have gotten a lot of feedback on that doing this is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| but there have been some concerns about some areas around the edges of this that could be made better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| Speaking not as chair, but just as Hugh Nystrom, 4th County Commission District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I would consider it a good thing if we wanted to send it back to the planning commission to take one more look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| and do another deep dive if they see any edges on this that they'd like to make any revisions and then bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| We do not have anything on our agenda in the next month or two or three related to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| so I do not want to rush, and I do want to demonstrate good faith effort to all of my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| and all the folks in the community who care so much about planning on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| I will make that as a motion from the chair's desk, and it has been seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Director Green, how long have you guys spent on this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Several months, but having experienced zoning updates, a lot of people don't get involved until near the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| and I appreciate the fact that people are actually making comments after having read and become informed about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| and I'm certainly willing to take the time to continue working with the community to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Do you see any changes in it that you would make at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Looking at the comments that I've received from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| there are some revisions that I think would improve the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Director Green, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I think there are some comments that have been received from the public that would strengthen the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| and I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| I think we do need to take a look at some of those comments that would probably make it a better overall for moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Yes, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Director Green, I just want to kind of go on record that you and I have had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| and that I would really love to see, as part of the process, a site map, sort of a process of this particular step-by-step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| I think you have a very good sort of flow chart of how the zoning works or how use on review works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and I think a similar tool would be helpful for the public to understand the process and what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| And then I would like, as this goes back, to just make it, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| known that I really do think that one section that should really be paid attention to is the Section B of the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| where I really do feel like instead of an optional concept plan, it ought to be a required concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| But perhaps when it goes back and there's more planning done and it's in your purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I wouldn't mind to come and speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| If you could just put a note on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| It seems like there's a sentiment to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I'll be ready to make a motion if we've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| It's, you know, we don't need to be in a hurry, so that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| I actually made the motion from the Chairs, and it was seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Is there any additional discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Madam Clerk, if we could now get back into the, for lack of a better word, the meat of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| The next item will be Item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:44| This is 3-A-19-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| It's a request of Nader Burbark, revised for South County Sector Plan Amendment from MDR-O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| Medium Density Residential and Office, and HP Hillside Protection to GC, General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| and HP Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| This property is located at 0 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Parcel ID 137197, part of Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| By a vote of 9-5, the Planning Commission move to adopt a resolution amending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| South County Sector Plan for this property to General Commercial with Hillside Protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| The request had been reduced to 0.64 acres, and the Commission found that with this small parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| it could have been considered an omission in the original sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| The designation of the small parcel would still leave a portion of MDR-O transition zone between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| commercial development and the residential development to the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Sir, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Ned Mubarak, 1260 Arbor Brook Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Mr. Mubarak, if you could briefly state what your intention is for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Well, just to develop the property, you know, improve the property and develop it in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| some type of commercial shopping center or just whatever we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| And once again, is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| The Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Mr. Mubarak and I just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| My only concern was the no grading at the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| and he agreed that there will not be any grading back at the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| It's probably 30 feet or higher back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| We want to stop erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And I believe I'm going to make my recommendations per MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| because that is the way it is stated in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| So there will be no grading there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| So I will make a motion that we approve at MPC commissioner's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| And seconded by, that was Commissioner Biggs who made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| So is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=1884)|

| 1:06:54| Mr. Bixby, you're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| This is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| You know, normally the past few years when we've gotten a denial of a MPC case, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| usually it's a 9 to 3 vote, 10 to 2, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| Could you maybe give us some kind of overview of why this was an adamant 100% shutout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:21| The Planning Commission has gotten, I think, good at looking at all the uses committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| in a zoning changes made and looking at the broad uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| There are no limitations on uses in the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Instead of a listing for many uses, it states that the intent is not to limit uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| The Planning Commission understands that they can't tie the applicant to a commitment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| the auto repair, although we believe in his intentions, once the zoning is placed, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| use permitted in that zoning district could be located on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| The Commission looked beyond the proposed use, all the uses that could be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| and felt that this location would not be appropriate for those broad uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| And also, looking at the, I guess, the nose of the camel in the tent, planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| on 2.69 acres creates a start or a node for expanding that planned commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| to a broader area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| And then on the other side of Johnson Road is Amherst Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Was the Planning Commissioners trying to maintain a residential flair for that area because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| of the elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| They didn't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| I'm trying to remember their conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| It was brought up that it was near a school in traffic or if it's planned commercial expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| it could have a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| I don't think they dwelt on that to any extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Director Green, to Commissioner Schoonmaker's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| The sector plan calls for neighborhood commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| And that use can be as probably more intensive and invasive than some planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| uses as far as traffic, noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| Maybe one use in the neighborhood commercial could be more intense than one use in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| planned permitted and planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| But overall, the planned commercial is much more intense than neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| But this site was already sector planned as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4188)|

| 1:09:57| A few quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Actually, Director Snowden, I have a quick question for you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| The applicant mentioned that there are already curb cuts into Shod Road now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I'm not seeing any on Google Maps, but that could be a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I'm not entirely sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| When Shod Road was constructed, there was a single family residence there that I'm fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| certain had an access off of Johnson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| I don't recall putting a curb ramp in on Shod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Not to say there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| I just don't recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| And if the applicant's plans were approved and it was front facing to Shod Road, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:45| would be a whole different conversation or process to gain access off Shod Road into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| He would have to meet our access control policy spacing for intersection clearance and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| This may be a question for the both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Shod Road is the next corridor, major corridor for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| And if you go further east on Shod Road, it becomes very commercial after some period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| And then, of course, you have the Shod Road expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| So on one end, you have a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| On the other end, you have a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| And then you're working on the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| So is Shod Road in the bigger planning scheme of things not already envisioned as the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:38| commercial corridor all the way through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| I think we have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Is it a transportation corridor to facilitate the movement of people and goods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| Or is it a place to line with businesses and be constrained because of turning movements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| And that's a question we have to look at looking at the long range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Do we try to consolidate those commercial developments where they are now and maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| the vehicle carrying capacity of other sections of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| And that's maybe a longer, a bigger question than we can settle here on a piecemeal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| I guess what I'm getting to is we just approved a huge commercial development at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| of Shod Road and Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| That had been looked at in a longer range view, a more comprehensive view, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| was identified as a place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| But I mean, we have commercial all the way from 75 into where we're past Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| And then we have another one from Lovell Road all the way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| And we're working on the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| It seems to me that it's going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Well, maybe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Well, maybe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| But do we do it in a piecemeal basis or do we do it in a more comprehensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Will we address the issues of intersection design, safety of traffic, or do we take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| on a piecemeal basis or here, here, there, where it's more difficult to ensure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| infrastructure is safe and that it's adequate to meet the needs of any type of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| that would go into that zoning designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| And there's a business being operated there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| No, there's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| So, the pictures that I saw are just somebody's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| All the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| That was another one down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I was so confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| That's all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| I mean, just one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| I did have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| My question is, in the applicant's filing, there is no way to limit its use if approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:54| I'm going to defer to Mr. Sanders on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Mr. Sanders, is there a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I know that there are some challenges in limiting when you rezone a property in the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Tennessee to do contract or conditional zoning that would limit uses by letting Mr. Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I'm happy to do that if it's at the Commission's pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| So, the answer is, if it's the Commission's pleasure, it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| I'm happy to answer the question if you'd like me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| So, there's sort of a gray area in Tennessee law when it comes to the Commission's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| to condition zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| It's not an area of law that gets litigated a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| We do it all the time, but it's not normally with regard to a use that's permitted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| It's normally with regard to, oh, you're not going to, for instance, grade on the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| of the lot that's steep, and that's a condition of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| That's one we entertain tonight and granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| But when you get down into what use is permitted and what use is not permitted, and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| where it's not a unilateral imposition of the condition, there's some sort of back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| forth between the Commission and the applicant, it's a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| Are you amending the zoning ordinance on the fly, which would require, as we know, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| readings, or are you negotiating with the party that would be a contract zoning that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| obviously illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| So the kinds of conditions that are not controversial and imposed unilaterally are generally okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:52| but the types of conditions that go to the heart of the ordinance, what uses are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| and what uses are not permitted, normally the Commission is limited to what's stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| in the ordinance, and it can't pick and choose what uses it wants to give one property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:13| and not another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| To put it another way, the correct procedure to go through would be to amend the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:23| ordinance and create a new zone that had certain uses in it and not other uses, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| a procedure that's provided for and not something that's normally done through a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| So it would be a cleaner way to, as Commissioner Anders said, add the type of business in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:51| existing neighborhood commercial ordinance than to amend and limit the use of this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| planned commercial to that one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| That is one way of going about it, and that's something that you all are very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| It's something that would go before the Planning Commission as a text amendment and come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| this body for two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I tend to agree with Commissioner Anders that it makes no sense that what's existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| now would essentially allow much bigger, much more impactful use than what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:34| To be clear, I don't think it's like current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| I think that's how the sector plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I think, is it still zoned ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Still zoned ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Well, what would be natural for this in neighborhood commercial would not allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| I wonder if it makes it cleaner to really focus on that, even if it does take it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| bit longer, so there's a clean way to focus on both accommodating the homeowners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| are there and nearby and the people that would like to establish a business in what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| is a commercial corridor or soon to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Mr. Chair, I have a point of clarification I want to ask the Law Director on the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| question that was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| I may have misunderstood you, but I was getting the feeling that you were saying that we as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| a body can't unilaterally tell people you can or can't limit use on a property in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:35| zone that allows those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Is it any less gray if it is the property owner that is offering up the restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:46| This is not an area of zoning law that gets litigated a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| So, you're asking me to draw from general principles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4732)|
| 1:19:03| I can't point to a case that says, you know, this is legal and this is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| There is a case that makes a distinction between conditional zoning and contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:17| In that case, it falls under another subsection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| And by contract zoning, you mean where there's a negotiation that takes place between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| body and the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| And that case was decided under a different subsection than we would be under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| But the court said there that conditional zoning is something that a commission can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| do, but contract zoning is something it can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| Contract zoning being a quid pro quo, the property owner offers the commission something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| in exchange for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| They said that a unilateral imposition of a condition would be something that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| But when you get to the heart of an ordinance where the commission has, in the text of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:10| ordinance, said these are the uses that are to be permitted in a zone, it opens you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:25| to litigation to pick and choose certain uses and say this property owner gets to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:37| in these uses in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| In the same zone over here, this property owner does not get to engage in those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| But it does make a difference if it's the property owner that offers up the sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| and it's not something that is demanded of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| That may be more on the side of contract zoning where we have an offer, give me this zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| if I do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| Like I say, there are very, very few cases out there and the distinction is not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| It is sometimes courts say they're trying to discern the mental state of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| and the applicant when they're attempting to enter into an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| I say that we unilaterally impose conditions all the time because we've had some tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| But none of those went to the heart of the uses that are permitted in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I also want to make one more point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| This is one of those that comes to us as an appeal of a rezoning when the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| So the commission has two options tonight with respect to the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| One, if it's not inclined to grant the appeal and doesn't want to rezone the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| then the appeal could be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| If there's any inclination of the commission to grant the appeal or consider the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| the sector plan has to be consistent first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| So it would have to be an initiation of a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| It would have to go back to Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| And it would come back in, I guess, November would be the earliest it could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| It would be heard by the Planning Commission in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| likely not back before this commission until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| So what I might restate for the benefit of everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| there's two potential motions that could come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Either way, they could be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| If the intent of the commission is to grant this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| then it gets sent back because this is just zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| and it would not shake hands with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| So if the intent is to approve this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| the actual motion would be to send it back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| to adjust the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| If the intent is to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| then this is a pretty simple vote where the vote could come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| You could vote on both things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| I mean, a vote could take place just to either grant or deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| And if it, depending on that status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| that could determine the next motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| So just kind of restating, is that a correct restatement, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Moving on, Commissioner Daley, and then I've got Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| And then we can come back to Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| and then I'll finish with Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Zoning goes with the land, so I don't think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| tying someone's future up would be a wise thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| because who knows, in ten years, they want to sell a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| So zoning always goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Mr. Mullins, it's been said that it may be the simplest way to do it is go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:09| and have neighborhood commercial as a repair station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| which is going to take, Gerald, another two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| two months farther than going back for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| If, about the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| we could get an amendment before the Planning Commission in November to identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| and I'm thinking of an auto repair business as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| that would go before the Planning Commission in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Let's hope it would be a positive recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| come to this Commission in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| If this is remanded back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| to initiate a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| that would go to the Planning Commission in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| come to this Commission in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| The time frame on both of them are about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| Following the ordinance text amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| the applicant would have to submit a use on review request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| That would be heard in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| If the planned commercial is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| they have to submit a site plan for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| which would be heard in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| So the timing is very compatible on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Mr. Mullins, do you have any preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Well, I guess my client hasn't purchased the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It's under option, and I know the timing of closing on that may make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| He was supposed to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| He had some logistical issues with his children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| and he could not make it tonight, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| I know if the zoning was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| he would feel confident that we could move forward then with purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| Would he be willing to consider a text amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| I think so, but I can't say that definitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| So you want a yes or no vote tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| If you voted it down, we could still ask for the text amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Thank you, Commissioner Daly and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| I'd like to hear from the opposition about the information she just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| and if there is any clarification that needs to take place while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Did you understand what is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I just needed to make sure you were following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| That's exactly what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| And I think we owe it to her to clarify the two statements that we just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| because she's not following where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| The reason why I had to restate that was just to make sure that I even knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| what we were talking about, because it can be kind of confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| And I'm going to restate this, but I'll ask Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and the law department to clarify any hue-ism as I'm making this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| There's a planning document that states that the area that you all live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| and this particular property in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| which is this part of town that you all live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| that sector plan says that the area that you're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| should be zoned for neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| While it was born as agriculture or property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| the sector plan does say, hey, the things up in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| if the request comes in in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| it can be changed to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| And what Mr. Mullen and the applicant have actually kind of asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| is a planned commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| And not all commercial zonings are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| You know, you could say that the regular planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| is a little bit more intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| But what is a conundrum that ran, which is actually kind of interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| is the neighborhood commercial does not allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| it might allow a fill-in station, but it won't allow a repair shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| which is kind of a catch-22 with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| So the tough part, which may be the news that you don't want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| is even if we turn this down in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| someone could come back to that property and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| hey, I would like to do something that is neighborhood commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| and that would probably be something that would not be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| to this many appeals because it's already in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| I'm going to look to Mr. Green, and I'm going to look to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| and the law department to see if I've explained that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| Do you kind of get where we're at then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| But you still have the floor, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| Because I want to make sure she understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| he had initially spoke of some buffers and additional barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| that will provide your property with appropriate coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| And what did you think of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Because I don't like to go out to my mailbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| stand in the front yard, sit on my porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| and see a business out the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| instead of the beautiful trees that I see in a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Because we're a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| There's a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| There's times that we can't even get out of our driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| because of the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| And then you're wanting to add more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| to what we already have and more flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| because that property behind us drains right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| And I've seen two foot of water stand on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| So not even with assistance with appropriate storm drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| and leaving the trees and additional buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| would satisfy or support what you need as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| Not happy with it, no, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| And that property is, I would say, 90% shale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| There's no dirt at all except right where the house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| I just want to make sure that we're understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| where your perspective is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| As to whether we should amend the text to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| or send this back to MPC for a sector plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| if we amend the text, it will come back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| and exactly what happened with the last ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| could happen, which would be we send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I think if you're going to go down that avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| you just send this piece of property back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| for the sector plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| And that way you tie the issue to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| and you don't bring in the whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| onto this one issue by making it an ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| that actually is about the whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| and not this single piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| I think that would be the fair thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| to the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Commissioner Jay, your light had been on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Yeah, I think the historical look back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| on this note that Mr. Green was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| we talked about in the last sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| about neighborhood commercial from Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| all the way to Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| And we talked about making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| exactly what the sector plan looks like right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| The planned commercial for that spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| is very difficult for me to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Neighborhood commercial is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| I do think that our neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| is obviously outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| You could put a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| we dealt with neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| the first time, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| at Choteau Road and the Wigles there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| and everybody was up in arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| about the Wigles going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| So, you know, an auto repair shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| would be a lot less traffic than a Wigles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| But we could put a Wigles there in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| So if we turn, Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| if we turn this down for a planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| because I don't think planned commercial fits there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| I don't think it's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| but I do think neighborhood commercial does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| If we turn it down for planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| can they come back and they have to wait a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| or do they have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| For a similar zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| they would have to wait a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Is planned commercial similar to neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| I consider that two different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| I would agree with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| But I think, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| the dilemma that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| and the house in question in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| could be zoned neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And so if ABC gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| wanted to put a gas station out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| they could do it in three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| And there's nothing that you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I mean, it's a land use issue and it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| But I can't, PC opens it wide open to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| And I don't know if it's best to turn it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| or to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I mean, I don't know what is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| as far as logistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Because if you do tie it to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| it only answers the question for that one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| And we really need to look at the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Because what do you send it back as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| His request was GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| You send it back for GC again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| it's going to be the same review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| No, PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Or PC, he applied for GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| But either one is not acceptable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| I mean, you can't justify either one PC or GC there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| So what do you send it back for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| What are we sending it back for as a look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Daniel, Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I mean, what would we send it back for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| That's a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| But I mean, what would we ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| if we're asking for a sector plan amendment change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| I mean, the sector plan calls for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| He's applied for something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| And we know it's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| I don't think anybody agrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| that planned commercial is a good idea right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Well, that's to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I mean, the sector plan and the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| are legislative decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| The Planning Commission has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| that the sector plan not be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| but it can be amended on the initiative of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| Mr. Mullins, do you understand where I'm coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| I mean, if we could do neighborhood commercial today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| I don't think you have any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| And I think you could probably challenge it in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| and win on neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| If you can have a gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| you can have a service station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| you could have a repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| I think you'd win that in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| I mean, I just can't see planned commercial for that spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| because there's no restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| And we can't restrict it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| So I struggle with that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| I'm not sure I understand why you buy no restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Planned commercial comes with a heavy review, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| It comes with a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| But it's open to anything that's in that review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| in that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Any use within that allowed zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| And I think my point with asking for the planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| is that even though, in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| it does open it up to a number of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| because the lot is so small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| and because the planned commercial is so small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| and because the planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| is generally intended for developments of 20 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| it severely restricts what could go in there realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| even though, in theory, zoning runs with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| So that was the reasoning behind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| And that, because of the use on review process as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| it would address the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| with the drainage and the traffic and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And I understand Ms. West has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| and they're very real concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| and that can be worked out through engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| But with the planned commercial on this particular zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| it would be so restrictive because of what you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| it would basically limit it to what we are asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5775)|
