| 0:06:20| But it sounds like this employee willingly and deliberately sold to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| So you did get rid of this employee over this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=386)|

| 0:06:53| You know, 12 years and one problem and that problem was apparently an employee that just blatantly served someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:07:04| knowing they were underage and then they were terminated over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=424)|

| 0:18:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| We don't need to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Clerks, anything else come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Yeah, I'd like to talk about is there any way we could get together with the city beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| and with the city of Farragut beer board and work toward making our laws similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| I know we've got some problems, especially with training convenience store employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| If a store is in the county, it can start selling beer at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| If they're in the city of Farragut, there is a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| And if they're within the city of Knoxville, there's a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| And I'd like to see us get together with our friends and neighbors, both in the city and in the city of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| and try to consolidate our codes so that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| so that employees are always working under the same rule book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| And I'd like to know if any of you other folks have an opinion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and wonder what we would need to do to work toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I've gotten a phone call personally from Bill Weigert to ask if we can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| I think it's a good idea, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| And I would suggest two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| First of all, that we ask the law director if he could review the laws for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| the town of Farragut, and also Knox County, and maybe next month if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| or he may need to do it depending on his time schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| I know we're in the holidays and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| But if he could prepare for us a list of where we're different, that way we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and we can look and say, all right, Knox County is different from Farragut here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| We're different from the city there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| That way we have a document in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And then, Commissioner Smith, you could write a letter to the town of Farragut, city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| and close that document and say these are the items we would like to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| and arrange a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| That would be a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I think that would be the smart action to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| It would save us a lot of legwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Let me speak to that just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| We've already begun that process of comparing Knox County and the city of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| and the city of Knoxville's beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| And there are some distinct differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And certainly the hours of operation are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| And the hours may be different under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| But I've already begun a discussion with the city of Knoxville with their legal staff about this very subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| So I should be able to bring you something next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| It may be February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| But our beer ordinance needs some substantial, I think, change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| It needs some substantial revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| And so we're about that process right now, which I also wish to engage the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| both cities, as far as that process goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| So it may take a little longer than a month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| But substantial change is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Clerk, I would like, if we could, from the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| could we get a breakdown how many are on-premise and off-premise in the same way with Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| and the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I'm assuming you just got Knox County's figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| The city will have their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| But it would be good to have those figures to let's compare numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Mr. Owings, I guess in reference to the ordinance then between the town of Farragut and Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| is it one of those examples of the town of Farragut having a newer ordinance that has provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| that may be a little more up to date and more in tune with the times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Or, I mean, what is the difficulty with having different versions of the bureau ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| in different municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| The difficulty is really not within the provisions so much as it is with enforcing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| If you have different times to enforce, then certainly our folks need to be aware of three different time zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| And some of our establishments are, you know, borderline Knox County or city of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:23:03| or city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| And so, you know, they have to be on their toes as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| But that's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| That's the main thing as far as training and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| But being aware of where they are and what establishments are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| It places a burden also on, for instance, Weigels or even a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| because they're going to have different operating times for their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| three different operating times within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| So they have to train their staff accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| And they may move from location to location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| One day and the next they'll be in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| and next week substitute for somebody on vacation in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| In some of these, you go out around the level road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| You know, within a couple of miles, you could have a convenience store that is in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| since a lot of the Turkey Creek area is Knoxville proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Then you've got the county since most of level road is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| And then just over on Kingston Pike, a lot of that is city of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| So it's just, and it's not that I think that any set of laws is any better than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| It's just that I think that if we can make it easier on the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| by consolidating these, making these, making the same playbook for, you know, for each area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| I think it would be of a benefit for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| And I can't see any negative coming out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| You'll get a report back to us and we'll keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| I'll call Mr. Weigel and advise him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Is there anything else come for the beer board this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| We'll go ahead and start our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Clerk, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=1492)|

| 0:35:47| It came before MPC in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| The Planning Commission did recommend denial of his request for medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| and did recommend approval of rezoning plan residential at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2157)|

| 0:36:09| The staff did recommend up to three dwelling units per acre based upon a formula that we use to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2169)|
| 0:36:19| policies from the growth policy plan as a sector plan and the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2179)|

| 0:36:38| We did that and the resulting calculation came out to that this property was suitable for plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:49| at up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| However, the MPC recommended that the rezoning be for plan residential at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| This density is still consistent with the low-density residential designation currently on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| The Commission noted some of the zoning in the surrounding area that the up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2228)|
| 0:37:17| would be consistent with the overall zoning pattern that you have surrounding the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| They also noted in the report as with any plan that comes back or that is for property zone plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:33| your zoning is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Second step would be review by the Planning Commission and staff of site plans for particular developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| The Commission felt at that time that with the time of the rezoning that staff and Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| as well as the public could take a look at how the property will be laid out in terms of the dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| the roadway, the circulation system within the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2275)|

| 0:38:05| So the Commission did vote to recommend approval of the plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Well, first of all, to reiterate, they did vote to recommend denial of the medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| and did vote to approve plan residential at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| And I believe at the time of the meeting the applicant felt comfortable with downsizing his request down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2302)|

| 0:38:49| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Varner, who has lived at this address for two generations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| I've met with the guys at Level Road several times, the Level Hills Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| and Mr. Schoonmaker as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Our first meeting, I'm just going to give you a quick background to try to counteract what's going to come their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| was at the Panera Bread, and that was when I looked at having 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| They seemed displeased about it, and after a couple more meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| I agreed that it probably wasn't the responsible thing to do with Canton Hollow Road being serviceable the way that it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| and the slope probably didn't allow for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| So after meeting with those guys, I postponed it for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| and then continued to try to resolve a kind of in-between win-win situation for both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| and agreed to do five units per acre to try to do some decent upscale condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| After a meeting there, all the time in this, Mr. Varner's sister owns a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| excuse me, her niece that's contiguous to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| and every plan that I've presented to those guys has included that piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and they have every time pointed out, Mr. Fuller, you don't have this piece under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| And that has always been the case and been correct, but I've always been up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| after several conversations with the niece that there's a possibility at a later date that we'll get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| and I didn't want to show that piece of property not being in the overall development plan that we have for Mr. Varner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2412)|
| 0:40:21| And it came to my attention, the reason that I'm bringing this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| is that I have been called deceitful or given half-truths to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| and that's just not been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I've been up front with the Lovell Hills Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I've been up front with the planning commission, and I'm being up front with you guys now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| And we just ask that you do what the planning commission voted and give us a five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| If you'll give us your name and address, it's 422.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Good afternoon, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| I'm D.H. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I live at 712 Summit Lake Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| I'd like to invite your attention to three pieces of paper that have been distributed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Item A is out of the MPC workup, which accurately describes the piece of property for which rezoning was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2468)|
| 0:41:19| Item B, which is also in your packet, appeared at MPC the afternoon or the night before the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:31| It supports to demonstrate the appropriateness of some 74 condo units in support of the requested five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:46| Yes, that is misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| It is not the piece of property for which rezoning was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| Item C puts it together and demonstrates the magnitude of that error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| The magnitude by which Item B was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| Folks, I suggest to you that in the interest of integrity of the Knox County zoning and land use basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| it's appropriate for you to reject this recommendation of rezoning at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| The pictures speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| This additional 3.73 acres was never a part of the zoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| It only came in at the last minute the night before MPC's representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| And with regard to the nature of it, after that meeting, we went to Mr. Fuller and asked him to explain it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| He defended it as being representative of the 16-acre plot for which rezoning was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:59| On that basis alone, I submit that it is appropriate to reject the recommended and requested five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2579)|
| 0:43:12| Further to the issue of the appropriateness of three, you folks should have received a letter from me over the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| supporting that and applying the understanding of what was described as the appropriate zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| considering the steepness of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| I found out that I had an error in that and the fourth sheet of paper is an errata to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| correcting my calculation from, I believe, 2.26 units per acre to 2.72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| Long story short, three is appropriate, five is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| And beyond that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you, Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| I'm John Schoonmaker, 144 Tanrayer Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I'm here on behalf of the Council of West Knox County homeowners as I serve as president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| I'd like to draw your attention to the actual packet that the MPC has included in your commission packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| As you can see, there's well over 100 documents to this file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| It's been a long time since you've seen that much of support from the community regarding one rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| Now, it was brought to my attention that you may have not thought that this rezoning was important to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| because you did not receive daily phone calls for the past three weeks from citizens in southwest Knox County regarding this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:42| It was our decision to not go with that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| but to have a single representative either approach you by letter or by personal appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and discuss our situation with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| At this time, I'd like to, for the folks who are here from the Canton Hollow Road in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| to please stand up and show their support and remain standing if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:14| First of all, from day one, the residents of the Canton Hollow Road area have supported the Varners' option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:23| to rezone their property for residential use under the PR zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| So obviously the only issue of contention here is the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| which is going to directly impact the traffic, stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| as well as possible effects on the adjoining private middle school as well as their quality of life in the Canton Hollow Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:51| Originally, when the MPC issued their staff recommendation prior to the November MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| the MPC staff said one to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| The community has always supported that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| even though originally the developer wanted to have 12 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| and then decided to reduce that down to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| So there is no justification based on the facts that you see in your file there from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| as well as all the correspondence from the constituents in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| that there's a support for any density level higher than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| The MPC staff supports this as well as the community supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Therefore, we ask you to vote first to approve the PR planned residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:50| and then ask you to vote to approve a density of up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| May I have a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Yes, you've got three minutes rebuttals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| That's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I only need a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I guess I would first like to address the issue of, I guess it was Mr. Schmidt there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| But we have done several things that was asked of us from a layout standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| so they could visualize what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| And I laid the property out myself, which I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| I did make a mistake on that and was unaware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And Robert Campbell and those guys laid my design over Mrs. Valentine's piece of property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| But I also spoke to Mr. Schoonmaker and those guys afterwards and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| I'll be glad to e-mail you, get together, discuss it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| I'm always available and open to be contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| And I didn't hear a word from anyone to discuss this matter further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| But I would also like to point out that there's a process that the county goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| It's a zoning process, okay, which is what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| And then it's a concept plan where we can do some geotechnical studies, some engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| a full set of concept plan designs that has to be approved to address slope, stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| all the things that the engineering staff will have yet one more chance to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=2899)|

| 0:50:29| but it shows how important rezonings are to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| And I think it's important to this particular community that this be rezoned at three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| I don't know how many of you have traveled down Canton Hall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| It's a very hilly, very narrow, and very busy road because we have rezoned a lot of development out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3043)|

| 0:51:08| It is a connector road to Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| and it picks up a lot of traffic from outside of this particular area trying to cut through to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| And I think three units an acre is appropriate, given the fact of the slope that's on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3078)|
| 0:51:28| given the fact that that's basically what most of the property around there was developed at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| maybe not zoned, but was developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3094)|

| 0:51:45| And, you know, that's what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3109)|

| 0:52:02| Sir, it's good to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Could you go ahead and give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| My name is Ralph Lee Varner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I live at 516 Canton Hollow Road, and I am the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| And how long have you lived at this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| The property was bought in 1939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| My father purchased it in 1939, and I've lived there most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| And I'd say a lot of things have changed since your family first acquired the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Everybody has came in around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| I didn't go in around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| They came around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| And that's, you know, in the 30s when this property was acquired, it was predominantly agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| And I would say a man could make a living running a farm of this size in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| At that time he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| But times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| And when these folks started to move in around you and they started to move from being an agricultural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:53:07| to being a residential area, did you ever come down to the commission and try to fight the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| Or were you a good neighbor and just went along with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| I was a very good neighbor, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I let them make garden on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| I even let them have one acre, the school, one acre of ground so that they would have access to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| But it sounds like you have been a phenomenal, a very good neighbor who welcomed the change with open arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| and welcomed these fine folks moving into your area and building houses close by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| and even let them put gardens on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| And I really applaud you for being a good neighbor, and I'm going to support the five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| Things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| The world changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| When that property was acquired, it was great farmland, and now it's more suitable for condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| And when you accepted the neighborhood going from a farming community to being a residential community, you went along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| And I think that we need to go along with you now that this property has matured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| and it's time for it to be used for a different use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| And I think this is going to be a fine condominium complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| And I just want to say, sir, I've never met you, but I know several folks that have spoken so very highly of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3272)|

| 0:54:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| As you mentioned, in my mind, the issue is not the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| The issue is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| How many units at five do you intend to put on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| With the slope, understanding that you're not going to be able to use every inch of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| but do you have an idea of exactly how many units you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Well, typically, you know, at this point, through a planning commission support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| we have at least started some design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| But with Mr. Schoonmaker and Level Hill's efforts, we obviously haven't gone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| and spent any more money except survey money until we knew what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| But to be honest with you, my contention is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| I don't even think that we'll be able to use five acres, five units per acre because of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| But the bottom line is, per the handouts that I've given you, if you'll look within a mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| there is 1 to 8, 1 to 8, PR 1 to 8, PR 1 to 6, PR 1 to 5, PR 1 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| And the bottom line is, just because Mr. Varner's property is last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| doesn't mean that he shouldn't have the chance to at least own it to the maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| I personally think we'll be able to get somewhere around between 4.2 and 4.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| in my experience per doing some development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| So your bottom line would be 4.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| Probably for the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| I mean, we could probably live with something around there because it's probably the max that we can do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Buzz, any plans to improve Canton Hollow Road at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| Is there anything on the drawing board for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Not that I'm aware of at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I don't know if Bruce is here or somebody from engineering could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| I'm not aware of any, but that doesn't necessarily mean there are no plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| I'm just not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| And according to the MPC staff report, if you do 1 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| you're looking at 465 additional vehicle trips a day on Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| If I read this correctly, I guess my question is, at 1 to 5, would it be 465 or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| I'm just trying to get the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| It would be about 10 trips per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| So at 1 to 5, if you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Another 200 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I did the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| And how significant is the slope, Buzz, in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| I've driven by there and I've looked at it, but I, as far as knowing the degrees of slope and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| Most of the site is in the range of 15 percent to 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| You do have a little over 17 percent that's the most extreme slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| and that's greater than 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| So between those two categories, you've got 60 some odd percent of the site that ranges from medium to steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3454)|
| 0:57:45| And so it's a good bit of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| Roughly a third of the site would present the least amount of problem in terms of development, grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| And what is the zoning around the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| I see 1 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| I see 1 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I see 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| But around the property in question, what is the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Well, in the area, if you look, well, in the map, you see PR at four dwelling units per acre to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3490)|
| 0:58:20| In fact, this property adjoins that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| To the south, you see agricultural zoning as well as to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| And immediately to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Beyond that, then you see some residential A zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| And then further to the south, you see residential B zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Yes, I've got a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| In the piece of property that we have that we're looking at in the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| 3.7 acre adjacent property that's not been through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| So if we vote today, does that include the 3.75 and we're looking at the total piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| or are we going to vote on the project without that in the red?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| And I guess the second question is both sides have a lot of merit to what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| And I don't know if there's room for compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| I think Mr. Hammond there had touched on it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| If there would be room, we're at three and five, that somebody would accept the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| and take the sure deal versus the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I'll just throw that out to help both sides if they would like to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| So my first question is, are we voting on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| or without the highlighted red on Exhibit C there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| And who are you asking it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| They're saying that it didn't go through the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| I don't have the map that you have, the colored red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| You're voting on parcel 9.06 on tax map 143.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| You're voting on one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| The estimated size that we had is 16.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| That's what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Commissioner Hammond, I think what you're saying is the part that's in that red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Commissioner Ballard, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| That scared me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Commissioner Ballard, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Commissioner Ballard, I think what you're saying is the red area is the three plus acre tract that Mr. Fuller had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:39| I guess inadvertently had placed some units on because he's not asked for that zoning yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| And I think he may want to do that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| That's a possibility from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| But as of today, we're only talking about the 16 acres, if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| And in regards, are there any compromise between the three and five to the four or four to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| To both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| That's my question, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| As I just spoke to Mr. Hammond about, it was just basically a principality issue with me on the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| But per the slope, I don't think we can get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| So, I mean, we can probably use 4.2 to 4.5 and make our development work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| Mr. Schoonmaker, would you be willing to do four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| Well, first off, I think we need to have just maybe 30 seconds to talk to the people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| I'd be happy to wait 30 seconds if that's all it takes to maybe we come up with something that's workable for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| But one other thing I just wanted to mention because Mr. Lambert brought it up was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| we have a lot of respect for Mr. Varner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| He's been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| No one in the community has ever said, you know, you've got to leave that area, you've got to sell your farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| He's now to that point where he's going to have an opportunity to sell that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| And also, excuse me, I wasn't talking, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Also, once this track of land is sold and it will be sold for some type of residential use, Mr. Varner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| I understand, already has an opportunity to have a nice lot on the water off of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| So he's going to be said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And we know this lot is going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And we just want it to set at the right density provided with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| And now I'm finished and you're welcome to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| I was just going to say economics has dictated that a farm of this size can't survive anymore in the economics of farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| It's kind of a double-edged sword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| It's great that we've got new farming technology that make farming large tracks so much more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| but it just pushes the little guy out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| And what was he farming on the property, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I think what were you raising on there, Mr. Varner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Was it cattle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| This year, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Just cattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| If you could maybe take a moment and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:25| While these folks are talking, Buzz and Mark, you've seen the map now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| You're zoning the red framed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Because that hasn't gone before the MPC and we haven't sent out notice to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3818)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:21| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3861)|

| 1:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3913)|
| 1:05:31| Mr. Leuthold, Mr. Chairman, the community spent a lot of time and effort on this particular rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:40| I'm sure this close to the holidays we'd all like to be doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=3940)|

| 1:07:41| We're still on page 21, item 10E07SP and 10T07RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| These are requests of Wells Creek LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| The first is for a south county sector plan amendment from LDR, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| to MDR, medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| The second is for rezoning from agricultural and PR planned residential at one to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| to PR planned residential at up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4083)|

| 1:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| The applicant's here, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I know we have opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| The purpose of my speaking at this point is to request a postponement, which I alerted you to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Since there was to be stated opposition, it seemed more appropriate to take up the postponement at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| This came up in its regular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Again, I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Victor Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| who requests postponement to the February meeting of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| This rezoning was approved in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| Following the November meeting of MPC, when this received approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| we requested the opportunity to appear again before the Homeowners Association to more fully discuss our overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| and proposed overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| We were told at the time that there was not room on the agenda for us to meet with them in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| Thursday of last week, there was a four-acre tract that joins this immediately to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| that was rezoned or recommended for rezoning at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| When you integrate that four acres with this roughly 17 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| there are some changes that occur in how the development is to be accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| and it moves the access further eastward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| What a postponement will do is, by the February meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| we can't get everything done by the January meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| so what we were asking, we'd be hard-pressed to get it all done by January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| I'll put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| So what we were asking was postponement at the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| By then, we will have our architectural plan complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| We will have a site development plan of the integrated two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| to be able to fully discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| We will also have the more complete traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| and traffic analysis from Wilbur Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| that will give us the traffic impact information on John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| as well as be able to have computed, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| the necessary data based upon the overall site development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| as to whether or not a traffic light will be warranted at the entrance into this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| And last, and certainly, again, importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| a postponement gives us the opportunity to meet with the South Knox Homeowners Association again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| to discuss the entirety of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| and all of the features that will be available for that discussion that I have just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| At Thursday's meeting, after approval of MPC on the remaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| the four acres that's being added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| we again asked the people who were there in opposition for the opportunity to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| at their January meeting, homeowners' meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| to discuss this and answer any questions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| We think there still yet remains some misunderstanding on some people's parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| about what we proposed, and there remains some concern, at least on the part of some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| Mr. Brown back here about what we propose to do with other property that we own in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| or around this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| We just want the opportunity to appear, give them answers to their questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and again, give them more complete information regarding the development in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| With having said all of that, what we asked for and what we advised the people who were there Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| was that we would be asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| We would ask that it be postponed to February so all of that could be done and accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| And Mr. Jernigan is here, if you have any questions of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| But what we want to do is try to present this body with as complete information as is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| or can be available when we ask you to vote on this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| And that will give us the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| It also, as I said, very importantly affords us at least the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| if they're willing to let us come, to go to their homeowners association meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| and have a full, frank discussion with them about it and also answer any questions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| So with that, I would ask that we have a motion to postpone until the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| That's my request at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Okay, opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| My name is Bob Dykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| I live at 7544 Galleon Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| I'm here today speaking on behalf of the South Door Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| and we strongly object to any postponement of these two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| and we ask that you consider them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I'd like to tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| There are two issues at hand, but each one is dependent on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| The applicant wants MDR zoning to build more than 250 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| but to obtain the MDR zoning, the South Knox County Sector Plan must be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| We are opposed to both items, but the South Sector Plan change is the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| We believe MPC erred in approving the Sector Plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| and this needs to be heard and considered and fixed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4437)|

| 1:15:55| The previously approved and adopted plan is the product of the labors of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4555)|

| 1:16:11| This proposed change to the Sector Plan is nothing more than spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| which the Sector Plan was designed to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4575)|

| 1:16:20| and significant changes must be done in a careful, deliberate way with the big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| and the entire sector's best interest at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| A postponement effectively gives the applicant more time to continue changing the Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4591)|

| 1:16:50| The originally proposed condominium development is consistent with the existing Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| it's consistent with the surrounding neighborhood, and it is acceptable to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4615)|

| 1:17:14| The Sector Plan should not be changed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| If it needs to be reviewed and changed, there's an appropriate process for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4637)|

| 1:17:30| To change it this way for this reason is wrong, and the sooner it's addressed by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4650)|

| 1:18:49| They want smart planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4729)|

| 1:19:00| This is and remains a low environmental impact plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| the same as it was when it was being considered for condominium development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=4744)|

| 1:24:47| And I'll be honest, I quit looking because when we do a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| and I think maybe some of the other commissioners, sort of like what Mr. Juergen was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| I sort of am not that prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I mean, we can go ahead and vote, but usually when we do a postponement, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| when we ask for that, I think that we're going to be in better shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| I just wanted to be able to make an educated decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| And maybe that's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| When the factors kept coming, I probably should have kept looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| But when I heard that we were going to do a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| and even some of the people called me over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| and I told them that I heard there was going to be a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| And they said, okay, well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| So that's sort of where I was heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| But if we need to vote, I mean, we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5124)|

| 1:25:36| The fact that we agreed to a postponement, it was asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| but the fact that we agreed to a postponement is a figment of somebody's imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| They were told on no uncertain terms that we would be here today to hear this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| and we would be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| I understand you folks want to be heard, and I definitely want to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| But we just saw in the previous zoning the value of taking some time and compromising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| We had a very controversial zoning, just as controversial as this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| that in about 40 seconds they reached an agreement that was amicable to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5176)|
| 1:26:24| And I think that what Mr. Jernigan is asking for, he's asking for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| He's basically saying he hears you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| He hears that you don't like his current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| and so he's wanting to take the next 60 days to basically put the whole thing together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| and come out and see if he can't work some sort of a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| And I can certainly see the value in taking the time and seeing if a compromise can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| So I'm definitely going to support postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| The way I understand it, at the February commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| the missing seats will be filled by appointment, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| That's very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Well, maybe there's an ulterior motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Then you've got eight more people you can get on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Who does this work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| It works for his benefit, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Well, it may work for your benefit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| This is a huge risk that he's taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| I don't know what commission he's going to have when this comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| To speak to the last rezoning, I'm sorry I wasn't in here to listen to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| but did it involve a significant change to the sector plan in order to allow that rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| It involved a significant change in density from agricultural, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| what is that, one unit per acre to up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| So it was a pretty significant change in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| But it did not require a change to the sector plan that has been adopted by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| I don't believe that it did, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| I would hazard to say that it did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5288)|

| 1:28:34| as a result of that sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5314)|

| 1:29:41| Our big issue is with how the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| and we believe it to be an important document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5385)|

| 1:30:14| And that's why we put so much effort into putting it in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| and that's why you're seeing so much resistance, not to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5417)|

| 1:31:56| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you, Mr. Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| We're getting into the merits of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| not the merits of postponing or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| I think if we're going to hear this, let's go ahead and hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5527)|

| 1:32:13| Open the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| So we need to either hear this right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| or we need to be voting on whether or not to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| And I've not heard a motion yet to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| I'll make a motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Well, since there's not a motion, there's no reason to deny something that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| So my thing is let's just go ahead and hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| Anybody want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5555)|

| 1:32:45| Okay, we've got a motion on the floor to hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| A vote yes would mean we'd hear it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5572)|

| 1:33:14| So if it fails, it gets postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5598)|

| 1:33:23| would he then have to go back to a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| The way I understand it, Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| your motion is in response to the request to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| And that is that this body deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| If this body denies the request, then we are set for a hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Then let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Well, I have the substitute motion that we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| Either way, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5628)|

| 1:33:53| Well, let's see if he gets a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| So we're going to go with Commissioner Pinkston's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Wait a minute, we haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5644)|

| 1:35:52| So I guess, Mr. King, if you'll start and have your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| MPC report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5759)|

| 1:36:02| Has MPC given their report yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| No, they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5764)|

| 1:36:10| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| this is a request you have before you for Wells Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| It is for the rezoning of property on the south side of West Governor John Severance Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| east side of Winkle Lane, north of Tempton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| You do have two actions before you, as we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Set your plan amendment from low-density residential to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| and a rezoning from agricultural to plan residential at five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:48| to plan residential at 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| Property is located on the south side of Governor John Severance Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| To the north, on the north side of Governor John Severance Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| you do have property that is designated in the sector plan for medium-density residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| Part of that area designation is also developed with residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| at plan residential at up to one to eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| Both staff and MPC noted in a report and in discussion at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| that the property's frontage on Governor John Severance Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| as well as potential access to the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| and the potential under the plan residential zone to address access issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| as well as other issues related to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| would justify at this particular point recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| and approving the changes requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Granted, the sector plan does show the south side as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| One general planning principle that we work from is that in looking at development patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5879)|
| 1:38:09| it is appropriate to have development like development facing like development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| So if you do have medium-density on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| that will mirror the medium-density residential on the north side of Governor John Severance Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| So, basically, with those thoughts in mind, again, the staff did recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| The Planning Commission supported the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| It was a nine to four vote by MPC on both the plan amendment and the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| Okay, Mr. King, you are the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| The time is 520.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| I'm going to take a few of those minutes and then turn it over to Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| As you have heard from the report of staff, they have looked at this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| Staff has recommended approval, and MPC itself followed that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| and likewise recommends approval of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Obviously, that recommendation and that analysis by staff reflects their review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| and recognition of changes that have occurred in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| changes that are still occurring in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| where at the intersection of John Severe and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| you have a major retail complex being developed, which necessitated, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| a change in the sector plan in order for that to be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| The recognition by staff and MPC ought to be a factor recognized likewise by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| and that is that there are substantial changes underway that have occurred since 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| And that study, when adopted in 2002, was the result of probably about a year to a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| and a half worth of analysis that went on prior to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| We're now in 2007 with substantial changes having occurred and still occurring in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| This is a proposed luxury apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| All the market studies support the concept of an apartment development at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| It is a uniquely suitable site as far as the topography of the ground is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| John Severe Highway is already slated to begin changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| which will result in it being, if you will, a three-lane roadway in front of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| and changes suggesting likewise in the future to further improve John Severe Highway in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:41:06| There are two schools of thought and both have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| One of those schools of thought that has merit is that one way to deal with the issue of sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| That's the term that all the planners use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| It's not necessarily my term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| But it deals with the idea that there are places within the county where more intense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| is to be seriously considered as it eliminates urban sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| and the utilization of property more quickly for fewer numbers of people and or services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6098)|
| 1:41:46| We suggest to you that it is appropriate to consider an apartment complex in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| very appropriate at this point, and this will be a gated community, a luxury development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| And contrary to what the opponents say, it's not something that Mr. Jernigan proposes to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| do one time, and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| He's been here and he's been a developer in this county for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6128)|

| 1:42:15| Neither one of us have gone anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6135)|

| 1:42:22| And I would suggest to you that Mr. Jernigan has proposed an excellent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| He is an attuned, if you will, developer and a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| He proposes to build this as a low-impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| He's meeting all the TDEX standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| It is still going to be that, even as an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| And what he has proposed is, I believe, an excellent facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6166)|

| 1:42:53| I'd like to see a major luxury apartment complex done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6173)|

| 1:44:55| clearly recognized that if apartments are to be built in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| this is the location where they need to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| The size of the property is adequate to do the project that we need to get done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| to build luxury apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| It's a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| It's a pocket development in the sense that all of the traffic comes and goes from John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| There is an excellent opportunity with the addition of the 4 1⁄2 acres that we've acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| to be able to get a traffic signal on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| Again, a situation which is desperately needed to solve some of the traffic issues on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| I can go in and talk with you in detail about how this project is traffic neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| to what is going on in John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| And the point that I want to make to this, which the neighborhood talks about the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| and just to go on for two seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| we are in the process of contacting all of the employers who are at the intersection of John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| because the sector plan affects not only those people who live in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| but those people who want to live in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| And while we are and we're anticipating getting a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| we've spoken today with one of the co-managers of the Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| He, by the way, lived in the Smoky View Apartments, Smoky Crossing Apartments in Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| while he was opening up the Home Depot store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| He lived there for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| He informed me that there were nine other people who work at the Home Depot that were living there at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| and there are now numerous other employees that are working at the Home Depot who live in Smoky Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| They see an enormous benefit to having luxury apartments less than a mile from their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6387)|
| 1:46:35| I spoke with, again, just to pick up the phone and call, I spoke with the co-manager of the Super Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| He, as it turns out, is living in the Smoky Crossing Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| As I have told the neighborhood in the meeting and in conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| that the people who are going to be living in this neighborhood are traveling down John Sevier Highway to this intersection to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| We are looking to capture the people coming from Merrillville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| and ones who are coming from Sevier County to move them in and let them live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| The gentleman with the Super Walmart, he lives in a three-bedroom apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| He has children who are either too old or too young for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| He has been there two years and is looking for a home to buy in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| The first gentleman, the co-manager of the Home Depot, he lived in Smoky Crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| and now he's bought a home in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| exactly as I told the Homeowners Association what happened to the people who are going to move into this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Mr. Jernigan, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| Dicker, let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| You've acquired four more acres, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| No, we have not acquired four more acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| We originally tried, in most of the projects, neighborhoods that we try to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| we do try to acquire all the property around our neighborhood so we can create our own buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| We had made an offer to acquire four acres that adjoins this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| and it backs up to the half acres which we do have for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| which was approved at the last MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| But everything we have now is just a matter of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| That would give you almost another 20 condos, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| The four acres that we're trying to purchase can't fit into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| under the criteria of being able to build condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| The house that's on the property is too expensive to be able to acquire it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| if we can't put apartments on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Okay, I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I was thinking surely you could make it work with maybe 100 condos or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| We would like to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I mean, if we could have done that, we would have looked at it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| You know, going from 82 to 250 is what's really got these people out there upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| and I'm sure you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| I do understand it, and what I've tried to get them to understand is that it's a traffic-neutral situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| We are literally taking traffic off of John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| We're not putting traffic onto John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| And the traffic, if we had the time to, and as you can hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| it's almost like I'm doing stand-up comedy from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| but it is a statement that we do believe will be well-proven by the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| We are confident that the traffic study will show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| and we can't do a traffic study until we have all of the properties owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and we know what the components are going to be and the unit count for the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| And it's a little bit of a catch-22 situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| We have to have so many acres to be able to get a commercial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| You have to have the commercial component to get the traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| We are confident that we will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| I mean, the other four-and-a-half acres that we're adding is up for the January County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| We do absolutely believe that this is a project which is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| Just from the few phone calls we've been able to make today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| it's desperately needed by the people who travel to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| They may not live there today, but they use and live and work and want to live in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| and those are the people that need to have these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Opposition, you all, they've gone about ten minutes, so we'll give the opposition about ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6596)|
| 1:50:14| First of all, County Commission, I just really want to thank you for having it been heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| and I know that the people here really, really appreciate your ruling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| We have been advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Can you go ahead and give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| My name is Victoria DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| I live at 2921 Tipton Station Road, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| We were initially advised to retain an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| We've chosen not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| We just have a lot of members here who live in the community to speak before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| In accordance with the Urban Growth Plan agreement that was made in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| Knox County Commission has adopted the South Knox County Sector Plan February 25, 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| and this document then is a legal document, and that makes you all the guardians of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6662)|
| 1:51:10| According to these plans, there are exceptions that would constitute an amendment change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| On page one of the packet that you just now received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| you will see the MPC wordage for changes of conditions warranting an amendment of the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6680)|
| 1:51:27| Now, there is four bullets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| They're pretty easy to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| The first one is an introduction of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| That has not occurred on this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Second, an obvious and significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| There has not been one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Third, changes in government policy, such as a decision to concentrate development in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| That has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| And fourth, trends in development population or traffic that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| What the applicant keeps referring to is actually at John Sevier and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:06| but that has always been commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| That was in accordance with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| So there has not been a change in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Now, on page number two in your packet, you will see that you have agenda item number 111| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| from the MPC agenda date, October 12, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| I would like for you to take note of the land use and the zoning of the surrounding area on the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| the east, the south, and the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| It was all agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| I also want you to take note of the 11 conditions placed on the 82 attached residential condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| Those have now been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| No conditions were placed on the proposed project for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| Okay, now go to page number seven in the packet that I just now handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| I want you to refer to item number 57 from MPC agenda dated November 8, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| Go to the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| At the very bottom, you'll see it referenced as page number 57-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| The reason that MPC gave, they said they approve MDR because it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6789)|
| 1:53:17| with medium density designation shown for the north side of Governor John Sevier Highway across from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| The sector plan proposes low density residential use for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| The reason why there's MDR across the way, that development was created back in the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| So that was grandfathered in, that MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| We do not need to mirror MDR zoning on the other side just because it exists right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| And if you look at our large, okay, well, let's go on to MPC agenda page number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| You'll see item number 95 from the MPC from our meeting December 13, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| You're going to see there that the reason they gave for that rezoning of those additional four acres was they said yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6837)|
| 1:54:06| if previous application is approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| So that's what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| So if you all say yes to rezone that original 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| then this additional four that MPC recommended to be changed December 13 will be changed also next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| This pattern is inappropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Transitional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Yes, this parcel is a transitional piece because if you all decide to make this MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| it opens the whole corridor to MDR, which is right now primarily and predominantly LDR and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| This is piecemeal zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| It is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| If you please go back to page number one of the packet, you will see the definition of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6887)|
| 1:54:55| There have been no changes of conditions warranting an amendment to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| MDR at this location would not even follow a gradual zoning transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| The commercial property that he keeps referencing is a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| Okay, I would like for you to look at the very back, and you will see the proposed land use map from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| It's sort of tri-folded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| You can unfold that there, and it's in color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| Victor Jernigan is working on purchase agreements along West Dick Ford, Tipton Station Road, and Winkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| Currently his 20 acres would grant him options for up to two acres of commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6927)|
| 1:55:35| MPC's guidelines advise for them to avoid abrupt, incompatible changes in density, scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| and building appearance from one development to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| We have developments actually a half mile east and west of Victor Jernigan's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| that have not needed sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| In fact, we have many recent developments in the last three years in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| Some of these are Twin Creek, Wildwood Gardens II, Graybrook, Wood Creek South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| This has added over 800 units out in South Knox County over the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| and none of these required sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| I would like for you to look at page 10 in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| You're going to see some photographs of John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| This is a two-lane highway with not much shoulder, and there's no medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| I talked to one of the commissioners over the weekend, and they thought it was a four-lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| I want you to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| Now, I don't see how Victor Jernigan can say that this is going to be traffic neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6992)|
| 1:56:38| With the increased traffic count of over 2,000 trips a day onto this highway, it would add traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| It's going to add turning movements to this section with no traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Those pictures show you how truly scenic this highway is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| Now, on page one of the packet, you're going to see the wordage taken from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:57:02| It says that the preservation of the scenic designated road section mandates that the development along the edges of the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| be severely limited to include increased building setbacks, reduced signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| and limitations of the intensity of development located along the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| And you all are the guardians of this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| and you all were assigned the task of petitioning the state for further restrictive status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| And I've asked the state of Tennessee, and they said that has not occurred yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7047)|

| 1:57:55| and there was no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| And I would hope that he would go back to that, and we would like for him to be a developer out in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| We've worked with many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7081)|

| 1:58:43| A mirrored development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| True enough, the sector plan right now shows the sector plan, as far as proposed land use, shows MDR across the road from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7125)|
| 1:58:53| True enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| Currently, though, what is there is zoned agricultural, and it consists directly across the road from this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7134)|

| 1:59:58| I don't believe Mr. Buzz could tell us over here if it required an amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7198)|

| 2:00:48| This is something we have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| How, again, can you say that this could be traffic neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7250)|

| 2:00:59| How are they going to be traffic neutral and use John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| I guess we're back to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7269)|

| 2:01:34| The issues that Mr. Victoria very eloquently spoke to I would like to address specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7294)|
| 2:01:41| because they are the reasons that we asked for the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| and the reasons that we changed from the construction of the condominiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| to add more land to come up with the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| The first issue was introduction of significant new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| John Sevier Highway is going to be resurfaced into three lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| from the French Broad River to the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| The plan starts from Chapman Highway to Newport Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| The contract will be led in March of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| It is already in the budget and on the TDOT website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| that the intersection of John Sevier Highway and the Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| in the 2009 budget year will be transformed into a full interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| completely transforming the way traffic works on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| So the first issue is that it is a significant new road change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| which was not in the plan when the sector plan was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| The second issue, any obvious or significant error of omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| There are no place to build apartments that can physically be built on now in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| The locations that the neighborhood would choose to build apartments on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| are topographically impossible to get approved, either MPC or this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| because of the steepness of the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Or the sector plan has been changed to allow those properties to become commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| At one time, the area where the Super Walmart and the Home Depot are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| were to be medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| But the sector plan was changed to allow a 195,000 square foot Super Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| and 130,000 square foot Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Changes in government policy such as a decision to concentrate development in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| This body approved 120 acres approximately of sector plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| at the intersection of John Sevier and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| less than 3,000 feet from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| and there's no opportunity to zone or build anything of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| between where we are in our entrance and that retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| The impact has been that you've gone from about 200 employees in empty shopping centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| vacant Walmarts, vacant K-Marts at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| to over 3,500 employees today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| and at least 500 to 1,000 additional employees that are coming to that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| because of the government changes that have been made since the sector plan was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| Trends in development, population, or traffic that warrant reconsideration on the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| The fourth bullet point is the most significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| because the south Knoxville area is going to become the fastest growing area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| It has been for the last five years northeast Knoxville, Murphy Road, Washington Pike area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| and the growth that's occurred out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| But the lots are platted, the construction is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| and now the development is beginning to move because of the south Knoxville waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| and the growth of Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| The growth is going to and is occurring rapidly in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| The issues of the points that they have made are exactly the reason that the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7485)|
| 2:04:57| approved the sector plan change and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| It's the same reasons that the MPC commission overwhelmingly supported the change of the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| And I, again, ask you to support the rezoning request because I have met every single condition that they say is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| to be able to get a sector plan amendment approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7512)|

| 2:05:32| About John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| This is one of two, only two, traffic-moving highways left in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| John Sevier Highway serves as a belt, if you will, around the south side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7540)|
| 2:05:47| In the Forks of the River Industrial Park, we've got numerous trucking companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| There are hundreds of semis that use John Sevier every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| There are going to be some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| The four-laning is scheduled for 2020, and that's a long ways down the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| The three-lane, the turn lane that's coming along will be able to work except right there at John Sevier Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| because of the cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| The improvements they're making are being done because of the increase in traffic the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| We live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| We know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| It's almost doubled in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| So this highway traffic is a major factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| I don't think that there's really going to be that much change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| I know that it's coming down the pike that we're going to have a four-lane highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| but I doubt that I'll even get to see it in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| The other thing that I'd like to share with you is that we are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| South Knox County is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| And I know a lot of you have been out there, and it's just a gorgeous place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| We have had a lot of development lately, but we have all been able to work within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| Those amendments that he was speaking of about commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| it was there at that intersection where there was commercial zoning already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| So that was a logical transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| This is out in the middle of a corridor on a scenic highway where we have had lots of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| And that development has not needed a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| We enjoy the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| We know that we're going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| We would like to have the benefits of the economic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| And this is the South Knox County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| I'm going to let Bill Bob Dykes finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7646)|

| 2:07:36| Comment was made by Mr. Jernigan that all the changes that have been made, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| this development is required because of the changes made at John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| This is the original issue that's been in effect since 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7669)|

| 2:07:58| And I'd like, if I may, just to pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7678)|
| 2:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7700)|
| 2:08:36| Okay, Commissioner Smith, you get your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| I have supported many of Mr. Jernigan's developments since I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| and have been pleased to do so because I know the quality of the work that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| There's no doubt in my mind that this would also be a quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| That's not the issue in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| The issue is the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| I am not able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| I will be voting against the change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| But I guess, Mr. Chairman, a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| We do not have a motion on the floor, but I would defer to Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| since that's his district, if we do need a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| I'll make a motion to deny, but, you know, lights are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| and I think everybody should have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| Okay, you want to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Do you make a motion to deny both items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| The sector plan amendment change and also the 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7767)|

| 2:10:26| with Mr. Dykes and Ms. DeFeason here on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| You know, sector plan is a guideline, is what it is, and there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| You know, if we just went by the sector plan, MPC wouldn't have to meet the second Thursday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| It would just be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| When they go and make the application on the fourth floor, that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7843)|

| 2:10:54| I think it was Mr. King made the comment, or it may have been Mr. Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=7854)|

| 2:14:28| If you haven't seen Mr. Juergen's plan, if you haven't stopped by the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8068)|

| 2:15:09| How often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| We try to do it on a rotation of every five to six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| How long has it been now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| That's probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| Seven years, hadn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| Well, it was approved in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| Five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| Well, anyway, I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| We've got one light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| I'd like to ask a couple of questions if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| Is that okay, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| Just a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| One from Ms. DeFreeze and then one for Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| Mr. DeFreeze, you mentioned a couple of things about conditions of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| that were apparently very satisfactory to the people, to your supporters, about the condo development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| Could you talk about that in reference to the apartments and how different that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| And I guess that created quite a bit of difficulty for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Victoria DeFreeze, do I need to leave my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| The apartment complex was only going to be 82 attached residential condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| and there was no opposition for that because it did not require a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| and that would have been in line with the Graybrook development that also has condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| It would not have really taxed the school system that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| and the impact on John Sevier Highway would have been completely acceptable for that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| And I would be thankful for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| I've seen his work, and Commissioner Lambert is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| And his pictures and his plans, I have told Victor that personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| I hope we do revisit that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I would like to see that happen in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| I haven't seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| I mean, I don't have any way to compare the two, the condos versus the apartments, the setbacks, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8216)|
| 2:17:04| Does the MPC, Mr. Donaldson, do you have some response there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| Well, we may be, in fact, talking about two different levels of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| With the previous condominium project, it had already completed its use on review, at which time the conditions were attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8233)|
| 2:17:21| We're not there yet with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| We're only establishing the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| Once that's established, they will have to come back for their use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| and it's very likely they would have a set of conditions attached to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| Victor, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| You made a statement about luxury apartments, the need in South Knoxville and all that, and I assume that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| But I do have a question about the placement of those being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| and there's a whole lot of land in South Knoxville the last time I was there, and I was just wondering about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8274)|
