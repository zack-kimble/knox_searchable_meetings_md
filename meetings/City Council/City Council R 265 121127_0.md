| 0:02:38| to go ahead with the mayor's report, give you some time. Okay, several things I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| to report on tonight. First of all, I want to recognize, we have some folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| We have Boy Scout Troop 55 from Fountain City Methodist Church. They're here working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| their badges. Would you please stand up? Excuse me, we appreciate you and your Scoutmasters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=174)|
| 0:03:06| for being here tonight. Also, in the audience, we have Brody Husky. Where's Brody? Stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| up, Brody. He is with Troop 22 of the Boy Scouts. He is working on his citizenship and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| the community merit badge, which is required to become an Eagle Scout. So, I'm glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| have you here and good luck with that. I also want to recognize our very own Christy Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| Many of you watching TV last night, the Extreme Makeover Home Edition, shown nationally, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| internationally. It was about Knoxville and the great home build that we had last January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| here in Knoxville with the Watson family, who are the power behind the Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=226)|
| 0:03:55| non-profit that helps single moms and kids. Christy Branscom and her husband were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| lead builders with Grace Construction. They showed the two-hour special last night. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| hope everybody saw it. It really was a wonderful way to highlight Knoxville and the great community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| and volunteer spirit that we have in Knoxville with some 4,000 volunteers who came out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| help to work with the Home Edition and to help the Watson family. So, Christy, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| know if you want to make any comment about that. Really, just to say thank you to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| who participated. We had great volunteers on the site, over 4,500 people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| came out to support the Watson family and Restoration House. I'm just humbled and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| honored to have been a part of it. Thank you, Christy. I hope the chief has corralled Turtle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| Zilla or whatever that thing was that was stomping through downtown. We've got him under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| control. Not a problem. He personally has. Also, I want to thank Vice Mayor Pavlis. Two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| weeks ago, he chaired the meeting. I understand very ably. Not that I'm surprised. I was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| New York for two different events. We went to the Bloomberg Mayor's Challenge Ideas Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| We are one of 20 or so finalists for a potential $5 million grant or $1 million grant to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=311)|
| 0:05:24| our bold, creative idea, which is to establish an urban food corridor. So we spent two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| getting to know what they're looking for and further developing our ideas. And we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| to, all cities resubmit by the end of January, and then by spring we will know if we're one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| of the winning cities or not. That was a wonderful experience. I was joined by Susanna Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| and Jake Teisinger from our Sustainability Office and Stephanie Welch from the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| Health Department. We then went over to Palisades, New York, for the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| or Summit. Knoxville is a winner. They announced while we were there that Knoxville is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| of, I think, 31 cities across the world that were selected. And that's, at that summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| we had 31 mayors from six continents who were there. I mean, mayors from six continents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| I don't know how many of them, a lot of them that were there. And there were a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| speakers and more talk about what we can expect as the winner of the IBM Challenge in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| we will have a team of six IBM experts brought in to work for three weeks straight with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| staff and community stakeholders around the issue of how we develop a system in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| the folks who need utility bill assistance, emergency assistance, year after year, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| need to actually get to the root cause and do home renovations, home energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| upgrades, and weatherization. So instead of putting a Band-Aid on the problem each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| we're actually getting to the root cause. And so that team is going to come in and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| with our stakeholders in the community to try and set up a system where we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| that happen. So those were two really excellent opportunities that we had representing Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| Also, three weeks ago, but I haven't been, had the opportunity to say thanks to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| and to our community for supporting the pension reform plan that this council voted to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| on the ballot. We had 76%. That's a resounding landslide, really, for that hybrid plan. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=452)|
| 0:07:41| I want to thank council, Bill Lyons. I publicly that night thanked a lot of the staff, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Bill Lyons, council, Vice Mayor Paulus, all of you put in the hours and the time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| our employee representatives who worked so hard with us on that. Okay, Christmas in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| City got underway this past weekend and will continue through December. This coming Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| we'll have the Comcast Christmas at Chilhowee Park. So come on down to Chilhowee Park between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| 6 and 9 p.m. Free activities such as marshmallow roasting, face painting, and more. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| want to thank our special events office and Judith Foltz sitting there in the front row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| for making, she and her staff makes all of this possible, along with our sponsors. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| on this coming Sunday, the Knoxville Community Band will have their Christmas concert. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| is sponsored by the Parks and Rec Department, and that will be 3 o'clock this Sunday at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| the Bijou Theater. And of course, a week from this Friday is the Christmas parade. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| look forward to seeing everybody down there at 6, 645 is 7 o'clock is when we're marching. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=525)|

| 0:09:06| I want to just acknowledge the passing of the late Miss Lois Kelly, who was a resident of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| 6th District and lived to be 104. She was a great educator and also active in the local civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=554)|
| 0:09:24| history in this community. And certainly our condolences to her family, and she'll be greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| missed in the community. Thank you, Mayor Brown. She was at our budget luncheon this past spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| as well, and I know was at several of my events last year, and we will miss her. It was a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| nice service in her honor. Whose light is that? Councilman Campin. Thank you, Mayor. I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=581)|

| 0:25:49| going to call on Kristi Branscom our senior director of public works to give a overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Okay great. Again Kristi Branscom senior director of public works. The city of Knoxville public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| works department and the fire department are requesting that Knoxville city council adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| various codes. The city is currently enforcing the 2006 editions of construction and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| maintenance codes published by the international code council and the national fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| association one uniform fire code known as NFPA is being relied upon for fire prevention. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| most of you understand that the ICC is a membership association dedicated to building safety fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| prevention and energy efficiency and over 19,000 jurisdictions across the United States adopt ICC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| codes. In fact our state of Tennessee adopted the ICC codes as well. Building codes are obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| critical to our community. The regulation of construction protects all of us from catastrophic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| consequences of building construction failures and protects property values across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| I'll start with a short explanation of the construction codes. The first set to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| for approval is the ICC construction codes with our local amendments. The public works department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| and specifically the permits and inspections division engaged in an in-depth process to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and compare the currently adopted construction codes to the newly published 2012 codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| The various stakeholders and public were engaged in this process through various small group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| meetings the building board of adjustment and appeals board meetings and public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Internal meetings began back in the spring of 2012. We met with Knox county we also met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| the town of Farragut and embarked on a campaign to begin informing the industry stakeholders and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| public in general of the plan. Some of the groups with whom we met were the associated builders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| contractors the home builders association of Knoxville who I think is here represented here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| tonight and the American Institute of Architects local chapter. At these meetings the codes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| discussed and analyzed and local amendments were added to address their concerns. We included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| notices of the impending code changes in all of our communications through the permits and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| inspections department. We also posted information regarding the code changes in the permits and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| inspections department. As a part of this process the city of Knoxville plumbing and mechanical gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| boards also met to review specifically the proposed codes that they need to be adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| and these boards unanimously voted to recommend adoption. The building board of adjustments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| appeals met on three different occasions and then hosted an open forum for the public that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| advertised in the Knoxville news sentinel on two different occasions and the adoption of the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| were discussed and considered. On November 16, 2012 the BBAA which is the building board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| adjustments and appeals made their recommendation for submission of the 2012 construction codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| to the Knoxville city council for approval. The proposed codes were then published in the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| city recorder's office in November 19, 2012. Should Knoxville city council approve adoption of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| codes then it would be our staff's recommendation and intent to establish the effective date of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| such codes as May 1, 2013. After input from the various stakeholders in the community it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| agreed that such a 120 day grace period would give everyone plenty of time to become educated about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| the new codes and to understand best how to adapt to those. The 2012 construction codes being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| proposed this evening for adoption include the international residential code, the international| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| building code, the international performance code, the international energy conservation code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| the fuel gas code, the international mechanical code, the international plumbing code, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| international existing building code. In addition to the obvious benefit to our citizens to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| safety and protect them the codes also help city of Knoxville's insurance services office rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| that is known as an ISO rating. ISO is a leading source of information about property and casualty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| insurance risk. The information that is gathered by ISO is relied upon for measuring a city or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| municipality's effectiveness in regards to its community services. The concept is that municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| with well-enforced up-to-date codes should demonstrate better loss experience and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| insurance rates should reflect that. With the adoption of these codes the city of Knoxville is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| also going to begin doing residential plans review. This is new for the city and we're anxious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| to see how this implementation of this new process may also affect the ISO's residential rating and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| obviously the intent is that we hope it does a positive effect for that. So that includes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| first set of codes for the regards to construction. We are also proposing that the property maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| code be a new one for 2012 be adopted. As I mentioned earlier we are operating under the 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| property maintenance code. Adoption of the 2012 international property maintenance code will allow our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| enforcement division to be working within the most current standards within which to perform their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| This new code provides better definitions and explanations for many of the standards relied upon by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| codes enforcement officers. And of course greater clarification provides a better understanding for our city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| citizens as well. Once adopted by city council the 2012 property maintenance code we recommend would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| become effective January 1st, 2013. The final code is the international fire code. Currently the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1871)|
| 0:31:21| Fire Department observes the NFPA as I mentioned previously. But after careful review and study the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Fire Department has determined to be the best interest of our city to adopt the 2012 international fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| The IFC is published and a part of the ICC family of codes. So such adoption would be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| construction and property maintenance codes being proposed for adoption tonight. It will allow for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| streamlined implementation of the IFC requirements and eliminate the potential for conflict between what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| directed regarding fire protection in the ICC codes and the NFPA. The request for the adoption of IFC by the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| department represents a progressive and prominent decision by the Knoxville Fire Department. As with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| construction codes we do propose the effective date of the international fire code be May 1st, 2013 to allow for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| grace period as well. But I believe that the fire department would probably also like to make a brief explanation of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you, Christy. Chief Sharp. Yes, thank you, Christy. Christy has covered virtually all of the background there. But what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| do want to just reiterate is that we did earlier this year go over a very exhaustive and careful review of the most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1943)|
| 0:32:33| edition of the international fire code, primarily to familiarize ourselves with it and to make sure that we were comfortable with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| from a safety standpoint. And therefore, as a result of that, we do feel good about it as far as protecting the safety of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| citizens and our firefighters. And as a result of that review and also just to make our building codes and our fire codes be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1967)|
| 0:32:57| compatible, we are recommending that we adopt the 2012 international fire code and performance codes. Thank you. I do want to say I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1977)|
| 0:33:07| really am very impressed with all the work that Christy and her team did to bring this to us. All of the meetings they went out, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| just didn't wait for people to come to them. They went out to the affected stakeholders and also really recognize the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| for carefully reviewing this. I think this is a big step for us to bring these into compatibility with the fire code and the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| code. So this is a good night, I think, for us as we take a look at all of these, the adoption of these codes. Councilman Dellivopy. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| Mayor. I'd like to ask a question or two and then make a comment. One question is, if a member of the public wants to look at some portion of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2019)|
| 0:33:49| building code or a maintenance code or something, can they go online and do that or do they have to go downtown and buy the code in a book form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| and take it home and study it? In other words, how do they have access to this information which is incorporated into our ordinances? It is recorded in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2037)|
| 0:34:06| the city recorder's office. Right, but is it online anywhere or do they have to come and sit in Cindy's office and take a peek? It's not online at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| point. We do have the code books in the Permits and Inspections office, however, for purchase. Usually they're like $50 or $75 a pop, I know. Do you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2055)|
| 0:34:25| price sheet with you, Tom? No, I don't, but he's correct in about the price. Matter of fact, it's a little bit more than that. Everything always goes up, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| down, so yeah, sure. But there are places where you can access the code online. Okay, and the reason I ask that is because if some citizen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| interested in looking at these between now and the next reading, they would have a chance to look at some portion of the code. So thank you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2081)|
| 0:34:50| My comment, I guess, is in some 37 years of practicing litigation and commercial litigation involving construction, these codes obviously stand out as a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2090)|
| 0:35:04| for the industry to learn from past mistakes, from past problems and failures. And so instead of like a brute animal just keeping repeating the same dumb mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2104)|
| 0:35:17| hopefully we learn from those mistakes and these codes embody that good practice information. And so it really is an important step for our city and I know we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2117)|
| 0:35:27| had different forms of codes for decades, but it's a way to not repeat the house blowing off the foundation or the frost cracking the footing or all the things that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2127)|
| 0:35:40| disturb you if you bought a house or have a building. And it's obviously the industry learning from collective knowledge and looking at new materials that enter the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2140)|
| 0:35:50| workplace and the marketplace and it's a good thing that we're doing this. Thanks. Thank you. And then Councilman Saunders. Thank you, Mayor. I'm delighted that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2150)|
| 0:36:03| will have done the work you've done obviously and the thoroughness that apparently has been devoted to this. As I spoke to you this afternoon, one of my concerns is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2163)|
| 0:36:16| customer friendly. And I don't know if you can address that or you mentioned it briefly in the residential just a second ago, but I'm hoping that we can translate that to all of our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2176)|
| 0:36:30| Right. One of the things that we have been doing is Patricia Robledo, the business liaison person in the city, she has been helping us with customer surveys and getting good feedback for us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2190)|
| 0:36:40| government's inspection division and helping engineering and other departments, which I manage, helping them understand good customer service and understand the feedback we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2200)|
| 0:36:50| Perhaps where we're not doing all the things we need to do, but learning from the feedback and trying to determine what we can do to improve our service. I think the other thing you're probably alluding to is I mentioned that it would be my intent to eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2210)|
| 0:37:05| probably going to be sometime in the first quarter of 2013, to have a monthly meeting where we could have all of the players around the table, where we could have permits and inspections, a representative from engineering, perhaps someone from MPC, haven't mentioned that to Mark yet, but some others to come around the table to talk about projects and plans and things that they would like to do within the city so that we can try to get them started in the right direction so that they don't get bounced from departments or that they get all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2225)|
| 0:37:35| questions answered on the front end so they don't get too far down the road with a particular item before they realize that maybe they're headed down the wrong road. So we are working on that. That is something we continue to strive to improve upon and give a lot of credit to Tom Reynolds and Jim Hagerman as well in engineering to try to help answer all of our customers' questions and to provide them the best guidance that we can, but we know that we can do better and I think we've got some plans to try to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2255)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you. Thanks, Christy. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you. I do also want to say I think you've done a great job reaching out. The builders that I reached out to today were informed about it and had come to meetings and participated in discussion and were particularly appreciative of the amendments that you all agreed to and I appreciate that kind of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2288)|
| 0:38:31| Ashley Burnett is here representing the Knoxville Home Builders and I think he signed up to speak and I'd like for him to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| Let's go ahead and hear from him next. I think, Ashley, your comments are on all of these codes basically. Isn't that right? We're kind of a little bit out of order. We don't have a motion and a second, but since we're going to deal with all of these comments deal with basically all of them, I'm going to go ahead and ask you to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2319)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you, Mayor. Ashley Burnett, Home Builders Association of Greater Knoxville, 221 Clark Street, Northwest. I appreciate the time to be here. I believe we're speaking mainly on the residential codes, but my main purpose of being here tonight is to compliment you and commend your administration for putting together your team, specifically Christy Branscombe with the job that she's done in public works and bringing us all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2337)|
| 0:39:24| She's been very open and the process has been very successful. We've had several meetings. It's been a very good conversation. As Mr. Wallace pointed out, we are pleased with the amendments that are there for the residential side of the codes and we appreciate all of her hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2364)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you very much. Appreciate you all participating. Councilman Grieve. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to say also again, Christy, thanks to you and Tom and everyone that's worked on these. As an architect, you know, it's important that we have codes that are consistent, both from the state, the county and the city, and this is certainly going to help with the architects in terms of practicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2386)|
| 0:40:07| And so again, I want to thank Christy and her staff for all that they've done and encourage all my colleagues to go ahead and pass on all these this evening on first reading. So thank you. Great. And just everybody knows that since this is an ordinance, this does take two readings. So we'll be should these pass tonight, then we'll be back next in two weeks for the second reading of each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2407)|
| 0:40:28| And so we're about to get started. And these are. Oh, I'm sorry. Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. I also want to concur with my colleagues that this has cleared up for me some confusion about where to go, who to speak with and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2428)|
| 0:40:44| And as constituents call and have questions who are not necessarily home builders, but some of this impacts people who may add a garage or second story or whatever, I think that it really cleans up some language and makes things a lot more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2444)|
| 0:40:59| So as I have questions, at least now I know where to direct them a little bit better. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Councilwoman. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| Yes, on that line, I wanted to ask when you went out and contacted and talked with community organizations, did you get much feedback from these community organizations, positive feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2466)|
| 0:41:20| I assume that you did. And certainly thank you for a very good presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| We met with a lot of professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| We also notified them via email and fax of all of our meetings and our open forum as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| So they were invited to everything. Some of them provided some written comments. And of course, some of them were present at those meetings and participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| But we got really good feedback. I noticed Margaret Backhurst as well is here as this evening as well from the art to represent architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| Of course, Mr. Green can represent them. But Margaret is here if you want to ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| But she would be another professional organization that she represents an organization that we met with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| So we got really good feedback. Everyone was very positive and I believe very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| I just also wanted to thank Angela Hauber because she helped me tremendously through this process from the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| There's Angela. Angela, stand up. She did a lot of work from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| She does. But she really helped. And she was with me all the way through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I want to make sure she's acknowledged for her hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you, Angela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Councilman Grieve, is your light on again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Yes, Mayor. Thank you. I know that we're getting ready to vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| And I thought maybe it might be good if our attorney could explain why we have to vote on each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| Because several people had asked me. And so I thought, Charles, if you could go ahead and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Well, in the interest of time, it would be nice if we could just lump them all together and vote on them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| As an attorney, though, you always worry about worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Worst case scenario here is that somebody somewhere dissatisfied with being required to comply with these codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| should bring suit against the city and say that they were improperly passed and that they're all lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| And they are very different subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Each of these codes is a very different code dealing with very different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| And so rather than have to deal with that as a potential issue in a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| it would be much preferable on the front end to just go ahead and take that little extra time and vote on each of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| Do it right the first time. Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| And in addition, I was informed by the law department that Ms. Mitchell does not have to read the entire caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| So she is prepared to read the most relevant parts of the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| So is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Okay. So now, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| An ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville amending Chapter 6, Article 2A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Subsections 6, 41, and 42 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| adopting the 2012 edition of the International Residential Code for one- and two-family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| including appendices A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K, N, and P,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| with amendments as provided in this ordinance as the Residential Building Code of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| And that is the short version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Okay. Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I just wanted to call attention to one section and maybe ask Ms. Branscom, since it's her department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| if we can use this as part of our codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I realize we have the maintenance one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| But R104.9 on Page 8 or Page 361 of the agenda deals with unsafe buildings or structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2662)|
| 0:44:34| And if they're unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress or constitute a fire hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| or otherwise dangerous to human life, the buildings or structures are declared illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| And it says, shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| I guess the question is, do you foresee us using that as a code-type enforcement tool to get after the sort of the bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| buildings in the barrel that are affecting the good ones next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Well, we can certainly look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| But I'm going to defer to Tom Reynolds to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Councilman Dela Vokey, in the past we've used this section to literally bring buildings before the building board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| the Better Building Board, for condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| These are the ones that when you have a bad actor, you finally bring them before the Better Building Board to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Do I understand, I guess the second question is, do I understand that if somehow one of these codes doesn't fit really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| with a particular property, that's why we have that appeal board you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| that you can go before them after a denial and present the information about why you should do it slightly differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| Why you should get a variance from that particular regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| That's a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| It's the Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Do we have a safety valve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2758)|

| 0:49:04| and we were talking about some legislative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| that we wanted to look into to make sure that rental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and other properties were properly maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| And we had officials from Oak Ridge that came and spoke to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and talked about this International Property Maintenance Code as one of the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| they could use to deal with poorly maintained structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2962)|

| 0:49:39| to get after poorly maintained problem buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| That is the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| and it would be enforced by our code's enforcement department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121127?start=2985)|
