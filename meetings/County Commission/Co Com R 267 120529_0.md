| 0:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=897)|

| 0:16:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| If you'd please tell him I'm now going to talk to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=974)|

| 0:16:23| Ninth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| I may get chastised for this, but I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I have a real serious problem with somebody upholding laws that they can't speak and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=991)|
| 0:16:45| So I'll defer to the rest of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| I cannot do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1013)|

| 0:17:02| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We have one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| And that is pending, I guess, the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| So the motion is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| If you speak to these gentlemen, they'll tell you, and this lady, they'll tell you what you need to make sure you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| everything to get your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| So the motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Any other items to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| If not, we are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1044)|
| 0:17:39| It is 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| That means it is time for the public forum section of our Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| What we're going to do is we had some folks who had signed up earlier in the week to address us during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| So we're going to hear from about four or five people on public forum, and then we're going to go into the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1073)|
| 0:18:02| The regular agenda should not take very long because 95 percent of the items are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| And as soon as we read the consent items and vote on a couple of matters, we're going to come back to public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| and allow anyone who wants to speak and address us, you will have the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| So don't think that if we stop and go into our regular meeting that you're not going to be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| We want to hear from anyone who wants to address this body today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| First of all, I would like to recognize Ms. Mashburn and Bea DeSelm, a former Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| And, Ms. DeSelm, it is good to see you, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I know that you served this body admirably for a number of years, and it is good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| So if you would like to come to the podium, and if you would give us the name and address for the record, you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1123)|
| 0:18:52| Jenna Mashburn, 1533 Duncan Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| When a group of us began the Support Our Schools, We Have the Yellow T-Shirts Movement, back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| we began with some fundamental principles that have served us very, very well over the months that have come after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| We determined to be positive, and you all made that very easy for us by having the joint meeting with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1152)|
| 0:19:20| And I thought that we all thought that was a wonderful move for you to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| We had no interest in micromanaging the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| All of us have been to school, but we don't know what the professionals know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| We did have high expectations for their success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| I think the main thing we did was to determine to check our facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| So that meant that we set about to learn as much as we could about the school system and about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| And we determined that we would lead, we would follow wherever the facts led us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| When we were asked questions, if we did not know the answers, we would go to good sources and try to get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| And I think that's been an important function, perhaps, that we've served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| We've done this together with a number of other groups, and I think that was one of the surprises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| that there was so much interest out there from such a diverse group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| that knew that it was time for Knoxville to do something for its public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| and came together in support, and we're very grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| So what have we learned from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I had never been to a school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I've lived in Knox County for nearly 48 years, and I'm ashamed to say that, but I hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| I'd been to a few county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| But I have now been before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I've been to school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I've paid attention as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And mainly I know a lot more about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And I don't think any of our group has any intention of going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| We're going to be here for the long, long haul, continuing to advocate for what is best for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| It's been a learning opportunity for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I know that you all were taught, as young people as was I, to respect the wisdom of your elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1269)|
| 0:21:18| And I hope to do what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And Bita Selm is among those people whom I count as one of the wisest people I've ever known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| And as you said, Chairman Hammond, she has served this body, I believe, for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| So without further ado, Bita Selm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1293)|
| 0:21:45| Mr. Chairman and commissioners, thank you very much for letting me testify today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| We have known for many years that public schools lack the financial resources to give all of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| the education they need to reach their full potential and be able to fill a job vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1320)|
| 0:22:10| or continue a career path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| The stars are aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| You have a once-in-a-lifetime power to make a decision to follow the well-thought-out plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| and change the direction of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| You have the support of Knox County, parents, Chamber of Commerce members, League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| and thousands of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Do you want to be remembered as a courageous commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Do not worry about the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| The community will support you if you do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Help make Knox County a leader in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I wish we could have had this opportunity 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| Don't miss your chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Next, we have Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Is Chuck Williams here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| We'll give Mr. Williams an opportunity to address us after we go through our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Donna Fieldin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Is Donna Fieldin here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| No problem, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| My name is Donna Fieldin, and my address is 6112 Edmondson Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| First of all, thank you, sir, for hearing me today, and thank you to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| I would like to speak briefly in favor of the proposed budget for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| The one issue I would like to talk about and give a little more detail on is a consistently excellent magnet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| You may not realize it, but West High School is the only international baccalaureate school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| We are one of only 12 diploma programs in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| In our international baccalaureate program, we give 11th and 12th graders a chance to get an international baccalaureate diploma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| or students have a chance to kind of go to the buffet and take various courses of international baccalaureate rigor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1460)|
| 0:24:30| but not have to go through the whole program for the diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| This allows our students in Knox County really a leg up to get into post-secondary institutions that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| shall we say, rather restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| This gives our kids a chance to go to the Stanfords, the Harvards, wherever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| That's the important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| It also gives them a greater chance for scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| And in today's financial climate, every penny helps every family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| One of the things about this program is it's going to require money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| Right now, the money is not there to the degree that we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| We have to train each international baccalaureate teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| It costs a minimum of $2,500 to train each teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| We ask these people to be trained to teach a course with more academic rigor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| to use more of their time for preparation, more of their time for grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| and we just say, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| And that's all we can do for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| We need to have more money for this program for personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Because what we're seeing now, at least at West High, we are training these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| and then they are prime targets for other school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| And even a couple of other schools within our system who can look at them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| now you've got what we need, we'll give you more money to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And we lose those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| We're not only losing top-notch people, we're losing their investment and their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| So with that being said, and also the international baccalaureate program goes for 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| and 12th grade, there is a mid-year program, a middle-year program, which would start with 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and 10th graders we would like to look at down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| So that we have the full high school experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Eventually, hopefully, even to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| So bottom line is, you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| And if we want the best educators to teach our kids, to give them the best chance to the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| we're going to have to put some money into it to keep those people here and to train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| I hope that you will take that into consideration because I work with these kids every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| and they deserve the best we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| And any less would really be a shame because these are great kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Next we have Andrew Messing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| And, sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| 2054 Smoky River Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| My name is Andrew Messing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| I am a 2012 graduate of Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and have attended five Knox County schools during my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Recently, I represented Knox County and the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Through these competitions, I've met students from throughout Tennessee, the United States, and the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| When you compare Knox County schools to schools across the country and the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| you're asking us as students to compete globally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| We're not providing the resources for us to compete regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| The school board seeks to address this through a major investment in technology and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| which is why I support the school board's proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| With technology increasing at an exponential rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| students need to know how to use this technology in the real world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Those who are against students being provided with iPads, tablets, or laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| often scoff that it would be used as toys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| How many of you use a smartphone, an iPad, a tablet, or a laptop for your job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| So if they are valuable business tools when you're at work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| why are they deemed toys when used in classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Many private schools and colleges require laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| and most vocational jobs require technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| So why shouldn't we make sure students are prepared to succeed in their chosen fields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| One of the greatest benefits of my generation is our instant access to information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| These tablets or laptops combined with Wi-Fi in all schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| would allow students to access the latest news, research, literature, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| When the ink dries on textbooks, many are already out of date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| because of this constantly evolving information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| These classroom tools could let us use online textbooks with access to the latest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| With virtual textbooks, you'd be able to highlight passages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| take notes, and work problems out online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| As for homework, you wouldn't have to worry about forgetting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| as it's on your tablet or laptop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| and giving it to your teacher is as simple as sending an email or uploading a file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| You can create a calendar, look up a word's definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| and create presentations all on one device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I could go on all day about the advantages of having this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| as I brought and used my laptop every day at school to complete my classwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| In addition to technology, the budget proposes enrichment opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| one of which I have a lot of experience with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| For those of you who do not know, FIRST Robotics is an amazing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| where students spend six weeks building robots for a sports-like competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| Students learn not only about engineering, math, and technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| but about business, leadership, public speaking, and teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Through FIRST Robotics, I also obtained a student internship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where I worked on research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| for which I won international awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| And that's just one of the activities that the budget proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| It also includes many fine arts programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| and other enhanced learning opportunities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=1801)|

| 0:35:54| the first thing they look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| When parents come to our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| and they walk in the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2160)|

| 0:36:16| In order to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| we need to pass this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2178)|

| 0:37:09| I'd like to lead us in our devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| if it's all right with members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| As I read my history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I am always reminded of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| that when the colonists got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| after the Revolutionary War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| they were going to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| a constitution and as they were trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| to put together that constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| one of the issues being representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| The large states wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| one thing done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| and the small states wanted another thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| It became so contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| that some felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| that the very future of the Republic was at stake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| because there was bitter debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| There were divisiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| among those who had been friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| who had fought together during the Revolutionary War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| and it was at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| that Ben Franklin stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| and addressed the colonists and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| perhaps we need prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Perhaps we need to call upon the Almighty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| before we begin our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| just as we did as we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| going through the Revolutionary War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| The colonists debated that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| and there were some who agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| some who disagreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| but they agreed that they would begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| their meetings with prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| In some ways I think we in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| are facing some of what they faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| during that time in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| we have some divisive issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| that we are now debating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I would ask that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| in our community of all faiths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| please pray for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| and pray for your elected officials here in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| because we definitely need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| and so with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I would like to lead us in prayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| and then we will be conducting our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2319)|

| 0:38:53| that they have sent us here to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| not for selfish reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| but it is for the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=2337)|

| 0:58:43| with our lowest performing students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| are also the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| for our highest achieving students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| and all those in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Namely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| a high quality teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3533)|

| 0:59:01| classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| and today I want to touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| on two specific issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| or aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| that pertain to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| One is what enables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| a high quality teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| and two the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| of retaining those high quality teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| classroom teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| are facing increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| accountability for student outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| If we're to have the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| support required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| to meet ever increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| higher expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| We do this in private business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| and don't give it a second thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Teachers like many of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| yearn to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| all that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| to hone their craft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| This budget will allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| to provide that ever critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| on topics ranging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| to data analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| for improved achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| and everything in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| At West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| we're fortunate to have many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| highly successful teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Therein lies our greatest dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| and the reason expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| of performance based compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| is critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Let me give you a real world example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| one of the best English teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Shannon Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| was selected after 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| to become the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Language Arts Supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Prior to even applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| for that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Ms. Jackson came to see me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| in tears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| She discussed how she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| considering applying for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| and how torn she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| about having to even consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Ms. Jackson is a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| who has taught all levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| advanced placement classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| and international baccalaureate classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Her decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| to apply for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| was driven solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| by the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| for more income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Straight and simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Ms. Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| did the work of at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| two teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| without any additional compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Because she loves her students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| her profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| and she walked in our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| every day knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| the difference education will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| and most importantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And while West High School's loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| is Knox County Schools gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Ms. Jackson may have been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| to stay in the job she loves most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| if we had had performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| based compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| that she has year in and year out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| with her kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| At West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| and I venture to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| in many other Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| we have Shannon Jacksons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| These are the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| who as principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| we fight to save from being poached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| by other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| and even other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| who are able to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| a tipping point in compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| It's no secret for instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| that Mr. Bennett West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| and in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| for his AP scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| that topped the charts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| year in and year out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| is recruited every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| by other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| In fact this year Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| tried yet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| and was almost successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Ms. Bennett your time is about up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3760)|

| 1:04:04| in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| My forefathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| used a lot of courage and foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| to settle into this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| settle these mountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| and help build this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| My grandfather is George R. Dempster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| He was a mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| and two generations ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| he was addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| the commission on the same issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| What to do with Henley Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| There was a big debate at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Two lane or four lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Oh no we can't spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| What are we going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| There's a lot said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| I mean you guys are faced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| with a tough decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Now in hindsight it's real easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| to look back and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| of course we needed four lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| of course we needed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| a broad open access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| We needed to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| We did not need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| shortsighted about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| going to happen next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Now I'm a product of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I didn't attend the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| I went to Sequoia Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| and I graduated from Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| From there I went on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| ended up at the London School of Economics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| where I achieved my degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| I was a lecturer at Cambridge University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| So this old hillbilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| from this school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| was lecturing the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| You know I went to Oxford and Cambridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Well I taught there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| So it's a nice thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| implore you use some courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| use some foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Let's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Let's not be so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| shortsighted as only put a two lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| for the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Let's invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| in the future of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I am now a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I'm involved in moving millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| of executives all over the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| not just in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| And the first thing they ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| What are the skills and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| in your area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3968)|

| 1:06:18| to do what it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| to be able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| an infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and build a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| with the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Also if I want to move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| and put my children in these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| they're asking that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| The IB program is a great example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| So please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| look deep in your hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=3997)|

| 1:06:41| and use some foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| So two generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4003)|

| 1:07:23| for all of us here in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| As a community member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| as a pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4047)|

| 1:07:31| in our public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| I've had the privilege to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| with my church at South Knoxville Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| We had over 32 mentors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| working in this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| and have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| for the past 5 or 6 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| through an incredible program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| But perhaps my greatest thrill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| and joy is to be a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| I'm the president of the PTO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4073)|

| 1:08:01| for the school this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| And one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| that we deal with as parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4085)|

| 1:08:13| in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| is you deal with the same kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| at a micro level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| that you as a commission deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| complaints as well as good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| you hear good and bad and indifferent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| but one of the ongoing conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| that we deal with week by week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| and moment by moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| is the question of whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| to leave your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| in the Knox County Public Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| That can be whether you face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| at the middle school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| the decision that we have this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| of moving our 5th grader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| right into 6th grade at Bearden Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| which we will be doing proudly this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| at Rocky Hill, no matter where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| throughout the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| you have the same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| and sometimes it's just easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| to just sort of give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| and to not think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| and to say I'm going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| with the private route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| or the homeschooling route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| or some other route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| maybe move to a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| where things are safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| or things are neater or cleaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| or what we might call simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| you are going to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| the right decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| and the reason is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| you as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| have an incredibly important role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| here for our community right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| there are a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| to run a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| you've got to have calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| you've got to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| who handle the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| you've got to have all the educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| but someone has to be the compass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| someone has to point us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| to the right educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| and the right parent participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| and now we just need you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| we want you as has already been requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| by teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| by one of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| by the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| by the administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| and now by parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| to give us a chance to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| the way we already are investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| many of us are making up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| the difference every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| voluntarily between the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| that other schools would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| and that gap between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| and other schools in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| give us all a chance to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| not only in our local schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| but also in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| that don't have parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| who can make up the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| but so desperately want to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| the value of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| and make an impact in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| you know Shakespeare said it best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| there is a tide that rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| in the affairs of men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4239)|

| 1:10:45| let's make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| that I know you will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| with wisdom and good judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4249)|

| 1:11:23| to have your listening ear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| desire of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| to help accelerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| our students academically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| this is what Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| is striving for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| it's what Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| themselves are striving for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| I am here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| to share that I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| this proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| reasons are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| for student support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| I'll hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| in shame but it shouldn't be in shame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| our school didn't make AYP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| for several years in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| and because of this we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| what's called SES support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| and this was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| to us through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| to help us bring our scores up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| to give them extra support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| then once we made AYP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| now Celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| that was taken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| from underneath us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| and so then we're left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| on our own to do it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| when we found that this support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| is what helped our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| and our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| academically come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| with their gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| we had to make the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| it wasn't a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| it's just that it enhances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| teacher support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| which leads to student support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| we're a TAP school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| we have TAP master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| and mentor teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| I can't imagine what it would be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| without this support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| as Ms. Hill was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| they have lead teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| in these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| and I know this extra support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| is very much needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| as coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| as a TAP school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| as a coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| and this is support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| for our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| in PLCs where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| professional learning communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| they meet once monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| that will be gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| and taken away from us this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| you've been hearing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| about technology support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| we also had teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| helping in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| and it was a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| of the leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| that it really shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| focusing on the student academic needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| and so we put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4423)|

| 1:20:10| Here's a little of my story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| I became a passenger on CAT Lyft in November of 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4815)|
| 1:20:25| At the time, I was working for what was then HFS and became Senate Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| And I also had a position with CAC working out of the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4834)|
| 1:20:44| And I also have a volunteer position at Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| The CAT Lyft transportation empowered me to go from commuting to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4850)|
| 1:21:02| when I first worked at HFS slash Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| going to commuting from Blount County and living with my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| to living independently in an apartment and much closer to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4876)|
| 1:21:26| And I was able to provide for a daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| I'm a single mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| And I provided her such things as an upgraded flute for her high school band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4896)|
| 1:21:45| among many other such items that you provide your child for in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| And my child is now a psychiatric technician for the United States Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| And this is just to say that this is how much the public transportation services mean to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4919)|
| 1:22:15| Thank you. We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| Next we have, is it Liam Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| And if you would give us your address, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| All right. Liam Brown, 4614 Oak Meadow Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| And thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| All right. Every day, people play some funny pranks on each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| that just come from having these fake parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| It's not very honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| But I tend to laugh because I know that it's going to be hard to play one of those pranks on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| I'm very blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| When I went into junior high, I was diagnosed with epilepsy, a.k.a. seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| There are millions of people who have seizures every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| They will suddenly lose full control of their mind and body and be unaware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| So for some strange reason, the law felt that the millions of people like me shouldn't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| But I made it through high school in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| And because I was blessed with many people who care about me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| and were willing to give me a ride to practice and to parties, I made it through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| The next step, though, was to somehow get on the team and to get invited to the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| So what does all this have to do with public transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| Well, let's continue to show how blessed I am with people who care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| as we move into my college years at Pellissippi when I moved up to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| I'm going to speak from the perspective of a college student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| but I ask that you change words like schools to work office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| and you'll see how this really applies to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| I lived about 20 minutes from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and could tell that my family was getting tired of giving me a ride every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| So the disability center wanted to introduce me to ETHRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Now as a single college student, the first words that popped into my mind were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| is she pretty and what do I do about the dad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| But after a few minutes, I found out that ETHRA stands for East Tennessee Human Resource Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| and they do a lot of things, including public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Now I was in college and only had about six bucks in my wallet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| but that was enough, $3 to get anywhere in my county and $3 to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Plus I'm also saving a lot on insurance and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| So for a few days, I want you to look at your gas tank and do some of the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| and you'll see how much when you go on a round trip for your work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| you will be saving a lot also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| Now remember that we also have buses and trolleys and CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| and many other public transportations, not just ETHRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Find out what's the best price for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Now college students are always late for work slash class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| I had to get up extra early to make the catch for ETHRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| ETHRA has so many people to pick up, including a lot of people with a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| that may take a little extra time to get in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| But thanks to ETHRA, that early morning schedule was allowing me to discipline myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| to get up really early, giving me time to have a good breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and just get in the classroom on time for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5135)|
| 1:25:44| So the ride home, however, took a little bit longer than the morning pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| ETHRA got me home, but also trained me to be a college student with patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| Whether I was still waiting at school or I was like all of y'all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| stuck in traffic for what seemed like forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I was blessed to do a lot more than just change the channel of the radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| Public transportation means things like reading a book and legally sending a text message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| or just socializing with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| I met so many other wonderful people, including the joyful drivers who really do care about me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| and some other blind people who became close church members and friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| So here's my final point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| If it can reduce your worries of accidents, gas, insurance, maintenance, tickets, parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| if you can read a book and just relax while someone else drives for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| then why do we care so much about cars more than just taking the bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| People find cars more convenient, and it makes us feel a lot less dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| We obviously don't have some underground metro system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| ETHRA doesn't even work on the weekends, and there wasn't a bus stop near me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| So we definitely need cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| But one of the greatest blessings of not being able to drive is that I can cherish the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| that Knoxville will need less cars and become a city of people who care even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| when public transportation begins to grow by just one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Now I could go on and on and talk all about everything it would do to save our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| but I know a lot of us have to get back to our cars because someone in here parked illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| Next we have Dick Wirtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| Dick Wirtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| And, sir, if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| I'm Dick Wirtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| I live at 801 Van Osdale Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| I'm retired from the university, and now I drive for the volunteer-assisted transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5277)|
| 1:28:06| I'm wearing my nice green volunteer-assisted transportation program shirt this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| with my little volunteer transportation logo, and this is a program run out of the Office on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| which is part of the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| We get trained, and then people call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| And we drive them where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| It costs them $6 if they have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Otherwise, it doesn't cost them anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Most of them are people who used to drive, and now they can't because they're too old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| or they're too sick or they can't navigate or they can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| We take them to doctor's appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| We take them shopping for essentials, even the occasional nonessential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| And as you can imagine, they are incredibly grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| It's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| There's a problem, and it will not surprise you to hear what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| The problem is the demand for this service greatly exceeds the available supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| The program is about three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| It has expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| We have more little Priuses now, a few more vans, more volunteer drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| But at the same time, more and more people are discovering the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| They see us in our green shirts helping people at Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| They see the little Priuses going around with volunteer-assisted transportation on the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5373)|
| 1:29:42| And now we come to the matter before you, Commissioner Boyle's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| If you adopt it, some of the money will come to the Community Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| Some of it may even come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| But that's really totally beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| The need is very great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| And so far as senior citizens are concerned, as you know, it's not going to diminish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| It's going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| For reasons I'm sure will be apparent, I support the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5416)|

| 1:30:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Can I ask for a point of privilege briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| I don't know how many people were able to sign up to speak or how many intended to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| but I want to recognize the tremendous effort that a lot of people made to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| And I'd like to ask everyone who is here today to support senior transportation to please stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| and let us recognize you for making an effort to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| The next speaker we have is Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Is it Bowman or Bowman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5457)|

| 1:30:59| Come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5460)|
| 1:31:12| We appreciate your being here, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| My name is Joshua Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| My address is 447 North Broadway, Apartment 204, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| As you are aware, I am a consumer of the Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| I have a learning disability in math and handwriting, and I also can't comprehend things quite well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| which also hinders me from not getting my driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| It hinders me of learning different things slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| I'm working to get my driver's license right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| If it wasn't for public transportation, I would be stuck at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| I would have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| I would have nowhere to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| I would be stuck at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| And it's really hard because I'm a very person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| I love going out and doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| And if it wasn't for the fact of Commissioner Burrell's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| many people would be stuck at home, would have nowhere to do, would have no empowerment for their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| And as a person through public transportation, I've been riding the bus system ever since I was 18 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5541)|
| 1:32:30| and I get there from church to work as well as many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| I hang out with my friends and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| And if it wasn't for a proposal for Commissioner Burrell's, where would we be at today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| Where would I be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Where would everybody else be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Cars, they're fast and economical and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| but people that can't drive or have hindering effects of their day-to-day lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| they have a hard time of just comprehending to learn how to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| Where would they be at today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| Like I said, K-Trans and CATS have been there for me for 18 years of my life, ever since I was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5592)|
| 1:33:21| I fully support Commissioner Burrell's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Carrie Llewellyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| And if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| Yes, 7408 Rising Road, Knoxville, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| And I'm also here in support of Commissioner Burrell's transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| I am the Disability Resource Coordinator for the Tennessee Career Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| and I am here because my job basically is to put individuals with disabilities to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| And when a person comes to me with a disability and their biggest obstacle is transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| if they have a disability that, for whatever reason, they cannot drive, I can't find them a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| If they cannot drive to get to work, it's very hard to find that person a job without public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| And I work under the Disability Employment Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| which is Tennessee was one of 16 states that got the three-year grant in order to do the Ticket to Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| We're trying to find people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| We're trying to get individuals off SSI and SSDI and put them to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| for those of you who are familiar with the Ticket to Work grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| So every day I've had people in my office who have a ticket to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| There's over 20,000 people in Knoxville and Knox County who have this ticket to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Several of them do want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| They do not want to live on Social Security on SSI and SSDI for the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| They want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| I cannot put them to work if they cannot get to their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| We need public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| I have to have the public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I don't have a problem at all finding individuals with disabilities jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| I have numerous employers out there calling me saying, we will hire this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| We will, you know, give them the accommodations that they need in order for them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| But I have to get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| And I applaud you, Commissioner Brules, for bringing this up and for a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| I mean, I'm a homeowner, and I will gladly give a penny in order to allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| I have a six-year-old with autism at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| and I would love to know that, you know, years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| that there's a possibility that he could get to his job when he needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| I have multiple sclerosis myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| I found out nine years ago that I was diagnosed with MS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| I'm a lucky diagnosee because I'm still walking, and I'm doing well on my treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| I'm doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| But the day may come when I can't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| The day may come when I need that public transportation to come before you, and for another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| So on behalf of myself, on behalf of the beneficiaries that I work with every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| and my son, and everyone else that's here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| please ask that you do pass Commissioner Brules' penny for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5792)|
| 1:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Next we have Ken Muller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| Sir, we appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| If you could give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| 67 Gilbert Lane, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| I commend Amy Broyles for bringing this before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| which is actually for me a re-statement of what you already agreed to, to some degree, before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| So the why you should do this really shouldn't be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| But I also speak at 67 as a senior citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I'm also a care provider for my 92-year-old father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| I am a disabled Vietnam veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| But more than that, I am chairman of the CAT Citizens Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| and thereby a commissioner of the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| And we have an outreach commitment to listen to the needs of the community, and people come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| Most of them are aged or disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| They speak about, why can't I get to where I want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| Why, just because I'm old, do I not enjoy the same freedoms and choices that I once had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| So we can talk about my needs, my dad's needs, but think about your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| A few things in life are certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| One of them is old age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| And are you going to enjoy the same freedoms and benefits when you are 85 or 90 or 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| that you like to enjoy today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| It's about decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Making decisions today for the quality of life in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| We've listened to many in support of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| What is the point of becoming well-educated to spend a lifetime of support, of productivity, of nurturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5914)|
| 1:38:45| of supporting the freedoms we enjoy only in old age to discover they are denied to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| And the freedom to go where you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Your choice of where to shop, what doctor, which Bass Pro Shop, which church, which shonies, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| Those freedoms should be absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| As surely as yesterday we celebrated those who gave us those freedoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| you all have to sit here and say, we now have the chance to help ensure those freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| I hate to see that this bill resolves down to a question of a penny, or a Big Mac a year, or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| The real commitment is to a continual affirmation of the quality of life we all want to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5965)|
| 1:39:34| And you are in the position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| This is just the tip of what some call the silver tsunami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| The wave of the impact of the changes in our culture because of old age, disabilities, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| And I assure you if you're not prepared, you're going to drown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| We all will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| So this is a small way of voting today for leadership toward what Knox County should be in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=5995)|
| 1:40:06| I issue a challenge to each one of the commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| To ride on our public transportation system at least once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| Ride a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Use the Lyft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Call CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Call the volunteer transportation, whatever, and ride it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| And while you're doing that, ask, why doesn't this go to where I live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| Why doesn't this go to my favorite doctor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Slipped in here is also the issue of seniors riding free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| And you might question, why should we support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| Right now CAT goes out to schools in the county and talks to students who can't ride the bus yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| To educate them on the vitality of public transportation that they may someday need because they do live within its boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6048)|
| 1:40:59| How do seniors get trained in using our transportation system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| People come before us every day in our Citizens Advisory Committee about the fears they have of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| The fear of sitting by strangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| The fear of being stranded someplace with people they don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| Allowing our seniors to ride free is a way that they can, at 65, learn how to participate in a system that they may need when they're 70, 80, 90, or 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6079)|
| 1:41:32| But that is just one of the facets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| The real key is, what is your life going to be like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| I was also a care provider for my mother until a year ago, who passed at 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| And one of her last words was, I didn't expect old age to be like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| She also admitted she didn't expect to live that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| Well folks, you do expect to live that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| And there's no excuse not to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And that preparation starts right now by voting for this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| Or if not, if there's any reason one penny is too much for you, or supporting persons with disabilities or old age doesn't sit with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6127)|
| 1:42:17| then I'd like to see in the news tomorrow your proposal of how you are going to address those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| Because absolutely, old age will come, and you will find yourself sitting behind closed doors, denying the very freedoms you take for granted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6142)|
| 1:42:35| Sir, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| I've said enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Commissioner Briggs, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| You know, I appreciate everyone coming down here and speaking for Commissioner Broyle's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| You know, my question, Mr. Chairman, is, and I was looking at my BlackBerry right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| and I'm over 500 e-mails in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| Do we have this in front of us already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| You know, I didn't know if I missed something in all these e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Is there even a proposal out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Make sure you want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| What I have recommended is a one-cent property tax increase to raise funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| It will all be given directly to the CAC Office on Aging for them to distribute among all their transportation programs for seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| including the CAT system, rather than us divvying up money for the different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| The Office on Aging would receive all of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| It would raise about $1 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| That would be what's necessary to provide transportation for, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| there's still going to be people that, it's still not going to be enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| but it will go a long way towards providing transportation for every senior citizen in Knox County that needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| It is the equivalent for someone who owns a $100,000 home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| The cost is $2.50 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| You know, I've heard that, and I really appreciate that, and these are some very compelling stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| and I don't mean to interrupt the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| but I was wondering if there's any other proposals that are going to be out there when we discuss the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| if we could get those to us before the budget discussion comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| Because I've heard that there's some others out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| There's some other proposals for tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| And rather than, you know, hitting us, you know, with literally minutes to reflect on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| to ask questions, to find out how the money is going to be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| I'm not speaking just about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| I think the school has presented volumes of information on what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| and there's others that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| If we could get those to us before we have our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| it would give us the opportunity to look at some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| because I think there's some others are going to be proposing property tax increases to add on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| and it just would help us a lot if we had those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| I don't think you were at the meeting when we had this, because Brad had brought up something, and Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| and we had all mentioned things that we would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| What I'll do is try to get the exact wording, and I'll put it on the forum before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| I'll try to do that tomorrow if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| But it's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| It's a one-cent property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| Every dime of that goes to the CAC Office on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| and they are responsible for distributing among all the transportation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| I have four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| I was just going to respond to Dr. Briggs's question or suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| I was contacted over the weekend by the Arts and Heritage Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| I don't know if other people were going to request a penny for the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| It was late in the weekend, and I didn't suggest they come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| I'm just relaying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| I'm not necessarily saying I support that or don't support that, but I wanted to put that on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| and I will ask these people to send their request in to commission in the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| Well, I will do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Yes, because I've heard there also may be an eight-cent increase also coming from another source that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6375)|
| 1:46:23| I think if it's going to be there, we just need to hear about it before Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| That's just my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| I have four people remaining who have signed up to speak, but if you didn't sign up, we still want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| So this is an opportunity for you to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| William Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| And if you would give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| I'm William Shaw, a resident and property owner at 1613 Clemente Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6410)|
| 1:47:02| You should know that I'm a volunteer at the Council on Aging and a member of its executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| I rise to support additional funding to transportation for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| As an 82-year-old Knox citizen, I fall into that group called seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| Some call us old folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| Old constitutes everyone from retiring boomers to centenarians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| We can in no way be lumped into a homogeneous whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| To the contrary, we have very significant variation within our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| There are three generations of seniors, some old enough to be my parents, others young enough to be my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| In Knox County, the last federal census showed nearly 20 percent of the populace is age 60 or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6471)|
| 1:47:59| Of these 80,000 elders, three-fifths of them, or 50,000, live outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| My age group of 80-plus years has increased by more than one-third since the beginning of the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| That will accelerate more over the next two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| Whatever difference that seniors have in age, neighborhoods, education, wealth, religion, politics, and ethnicity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6501)|
| 1:48:30| they overwhelmingly prefer to grow older in their own homes and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| However, in Knox County, like many other areas, the automobile is the main mode of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| Consider this, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| One in five seniors age 65-plus does not drive a car at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| and the average senior will outlive his or her ability to drive by seven to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| The dilemma is how to let seniors remain active, productive, and mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| when their driving capability is diminished or ended, and public transportation does not serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| The availability of accessible, affordable transportation is essential for seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| to maintain their independence and postpone or avoid institutional care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6558)|
| 1:49:25| Remember the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| The front end of the boomer generation has reached retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| and there is a two-decade trail of others behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| Improvement in life expectancy has also boosted the ranks of seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| And finally, the country has been through a severe slump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| that has increased the need for food and health and transportation assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| In Knox County, the economic factors have slowed funding just when the need was growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| We had a needs assessment meeting at O'Connor with seniors and people who worked with them about two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6596)|
| 1:50:08| and divided out into small discussion groups to find out what the problems were that they saw for the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6608)|
| 1:50:19| Not one single group left transportation untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| Transportation was on every list, so we're still involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6626)|
| 1:50:34| In short, the supply of rides falls short of demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| For example, CAC transit shuttle buses provide an average 820 trips per day for Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6639)|
| 1:50:48| who can't be served by KAT because origin, destination, or time of trip is not in its schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6648)|
| 1:50:57| In the 10 months ended April 30th, CAC carried 5,175 unduplicated individuals, 61 percent of them residents of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6657)|
| 1:51:11| With limited flexible funds, CAC transit provided only 39 round trips a day for persons who don't qualify for TennCare or other contract services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6671)|
| 1:51:24| Not quite half are scheduled for dialysis patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6684)|
| 1:51:33| That leaves only 21 round trips for everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| Requests for multiple trips per week for cardiac, post-stroke, pulmonary, rehab, and wound treatment cannot be met with the available funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6697)|
| 1:51:50| There is a limit to individuals who otherwise qualify for adult daycare at O'Connor Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6710)|
| 1:51:59| CAC transit provided 13,727 trips with job access and revenue commute and reverse commute funds for employment and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6719)|
| 1:52:12| There is a wait list of 18 persons for this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| We have a volunteer-assisted transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| Screens and trains volunteers to get fragile seniors and disabled persons to medical and dental care and to shop for groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6740)|
| 1:52:28| Sir, your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| In March, 40 foreign trips were provided to 69 individuals, but more rides are needed for the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6750)|
| 1:52:40| We chose Knoxville for several reasons to move here, but an important one was that the education seemed to be highly regarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| and we wanted to live in a community where this was so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| We have absolutely no objection to a tax rise for the public school system because the case seems to be strong for the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6771)|
| 1:53:00| Seniors with no children or grandchildren still can believe in improving what is good for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| because that good becomes the foundation for every other aspect of the community life and future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| At the same time, our seniors need to avoid social isolation, find ways to carry out their necessary tasks, even work in their late years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6792)|
| 1:53:23| Transportation is key to so many of these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| I hope you will support a boost to funds by providing a very small portion of a property tax rise to these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6807)|
| 1:53:36| For many of Knox County's seniors, the community is the only family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| Bill Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6826)|
| 1:54:03| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| And if you give us your address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| I'm Bill Dockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| I live at 4615 Holston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| I was accorded a singular honor a few minutes ago when Mr. McKenzie recognized me and came up to me and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6857)|
| 1:54:26| I know you're Marshall's dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| What's your first name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| And I've been known for a number of years in East Knoxville as Haley's dad because I have a daughter who goes to Carter High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6871)|
| 1:54:40| and now I have a son who goes to Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| And now I am left in the position where I'm a person known whose identity is bound up with his children as opposed to what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6883)|
| 1:54:54| I work at UT as a research communicator, and I rise here on, I guess at this point, on two different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| I came to speak on behalf of the penny for transportation, but since I'm here and have two kids at Carter High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6903)|
| 1:55:13| I also want to support the school budget as it's proposed because there's a desperate need for improvement in schools overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6913)|
| 1:55:23| I'm not criticizing the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I'm just saying in the current climate, we need the money to make Knox County schools the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| But the other part, if we're to be a civil society, we have to provide for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6933)|
| 1:55:41| I am a member of the Knoxville Mayor's Council on Disability Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| Now, let me make clear that I am not speaking on behalf of that group, but as an individual today and as an advocate for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6947)|
| 1:55:57| I don't have, I'm not empowered to speak for those folk, but I am a member of that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| I've heard two significant things here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| We've recognized veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| Some veterans have come up here and spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| That's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| One of the things that's significant about it is the fact that over the weekend, when we saw a lot of display of flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| and patriotic material, which I appreciate and affirm, I'm a child of a World War II veteran, we had a lot of good patriotic feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6980)|
| 1:56:32| The other thing was an AP, Associated Press, special report that didn't get a lot of play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| which gave me this remarkable statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| For every 100 veterans of the current conflicts, I guess that's conflicts plural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7004)|
| 1:56:52| 43 of those 100 veterans will be disabled in some form or another, will have a disability, will apply for disability status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7012)|
| 1:57:05| And they may apply for disabilities for as many as eight to ten disabling conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7025)|
| 1:57:14| Now, that means that some of those folk are going to be needing the kinds of transportation that CAT offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7034)|
| 1:57:24| and that these other agencies we've been talking about offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| We're coming to the end of a major conflict, a ten-year war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| and we're going to see people whose employment, whose very mobility will depend on the kind of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7053)|
| 1:57:41| that you can give to the transportation in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| I recommend highly that you look at that one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| I know compared to the school's needs, a penny isn't much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| But compared to the school's needs, a penny isn't much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| You need to look at ways that we can make this a more civil place so that there are not people in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7084)|
| 1:58:14| You have a difficult job on your hands already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| You're being asked to fund major money that some people don't want to see spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| But on the other hand, the expenditure of a penny can mean the ability of someone with some kind of disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7103)|
| 1:58:32| to get to a job or to get to something recreational that makes them a better person, that lets them enjoy life more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| I urge you to seriously consider that one cent as you consider all the many other calls on your abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7121)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| Gwen Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Gwen Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| And if you would give us your address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| My name is Gwen Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| My address is 4909 Johnpool Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| And it's spelled J-O-N-Q-U-I-L because everybody always asks me how it's spelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7159)|
| 1:59:27| And my zip code is 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| I am here actually on behalf of the one cent for seniors being I will be 86 in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7175)|
| 1:59:48| And I am perfectly willing to give up driving any time that they can tell me that I can get anywhere in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7188)|
| 1:59:59| that I need to go without driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| I don't like to drive anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| There's too many people on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| I'd like to see us get a lot more of them off of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| But we can't do it if we don't have the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7212)|
| 2:00:18| Now, I want to kind of go to a sidebar here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| I have been a resident of Knoxville for most of my, well, all of my adult life practically and most of my childhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7224)|
| 2:00:37| I happen to have been one in the first graduating class of Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7237)|
| 2:00:46| And that's when we were in the elementary school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| And each year they added another class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| And we were seniors all through all four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| It was delightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| I had my two older boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| I have five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| graduated from Bearden High School just before it moved into the new high school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7269)|
| 2:01:16| So we both kind of have these memories of being the last class for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7276)|
| 2:01:25| But I certainly support what the schools are asking for and certainly pray that they will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7285)|
| 2:01:37| I really have a problem, though, with our transportation because I live on John Cole Drive, which is just off of Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7297)|
| 2:01:50| And I cannot get to a bus place without having to walk like two miles because there's just no buses that run this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7310)|
| 2:02:05| They run that way or they run this way on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| Well, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| I mean, I'm pretty spry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I still can get around, but I'm not capable of walking two miles or even a mile and a half or even a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7334)|
| 2:02:24| I take exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| I do what I can to keep myself going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| But, you know, it's just very discouraging as you get older that you find that you don't have the privileges that you've always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7349)|
| 2:02:39| You can't get here from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| You can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I certainly hope that you will support the one cent for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7365)|
| 2:02:55| And I appreciate very much this opportunity to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| The last person that I have signed up is Susan Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| And if you would give us your address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| I'm Susan Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| I live at 5516 Brown Atkin Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Several of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| I've worked in the field of aging for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Never have I seen the demand for transportation be any stronger than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| I'll be very brief because you've had some excellent folks talk about their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| I basically want to say what I hear from other folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| It's, well, is there not something else they can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| Well, hospitals cannot provide transportation because of Medicare rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| Doctors' offices can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Families try, but they're strapped trying to make sure they don't lose their own jobs taking off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| to take their family members to doctor's appointments or to buy necessary things for them to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| We call them churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| They try to do what they can as long as they have the volunteers to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| But bottom line is it's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| And as a county property owner, I will tell you one cent is something I would like to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| to provide for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| And the quote that comes to my mind, and I wanted to give it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| and I found out that it actually is attributed to lots of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| But a society and a government is often judged by the way that they treat their older adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| and their disabled folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| I want us to be the community and the society that treats their older folks the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| Please consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| That's all I have on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Is there anyone else, though, that wants to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| We want to give you the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| If you would come to the podium and if you would give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| I'm Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| I live at 701 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| I did not come prepared to speak, but I felt moved to for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| I first came as an interested party in Commissioner Boyle's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| and I think it's critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| I'll come back to that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| I did notice that you have not heard from one particular constituency that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| with regard to the education proposal, and so I wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| My children both started in our public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| They got an incredible education at Sequoia Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| and one of the very best principals ever is sitting right over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| and her predecessor was also an excellent principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| and my children benefited from both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| For reasons that were idiosyncratic to my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| we made the choice to go to private school after elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| And so I represent many in that particular constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| in saying that my decision to send my children to a private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| in no way minimized or affected my responsibility to support our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7575)|
| 2:06:23| I think, as an employer in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| that the public school systems are absolutely essential for the success of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7585)|
| 2:06:33| and as one who made a different choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I still want you to know that I, and many others like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| consider it to be essential that we support the education proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| I did come here, however, to speak on, to listen to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| about transportation for seniors and those who are disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| and I really encourage you to think really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| about setting the highest possible priority on transportation for our seniors and our disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| I work in health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| I can tell you the tsunami that has been referred to earlier is going to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| and it's going to affect health care perhaps more than any other area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| One of the biggest drivers of the increase in cost of health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| is that people cannot get to their doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| when they are only mildly in need of a physician's services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| They wait until they're very ill, and they end up in the emergency department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| which is the most expensive form of health care that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| If we want to hold down the cost of health care moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| one of the very best things we can do is to ensure access to health care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| You've heard all the other arguments, and so I won't speak long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| I will say that for me it's not just a matter of practicality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| that we support Commissioner Boyle's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| It's a matter of just core dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| We have parents and grandparents who have done more for us than we'll ever be able to repay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| One way we can absolutely start to give them the dignity that they deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| is by allowing them the means and the access to transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| so that they can get not only where they want to go but, more importantly, where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| The dirty little secret for those of us who raised our kids in Sunday school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| is that we put a lot of emphasis on the Ten Commandments, particularly that one that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| Honor thy father and thy mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| I used to quote that one to my kids all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| But the dirty little secret is that that commandment didn't really have a whole bunch to do with kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7712)|
| 2:08:38| obeying their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| It had a lot more to do with us taking care of our parents in the senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| So I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| I've been to a lot of these meetings, and I've been responsible for big budgets in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| and I know about budget priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| But I just can't think of anything that's more important than our children and our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| And you've got before you today proposals in both of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Is there anyone else who wants to address commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| I want to give you the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| And if you could give us your name and address of the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Lawrence Tullock, 1907 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| I also did not come prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| And the last thing you ever want to do is try to follow Jerry Askew as a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| But I thought of a couple of things back there that I felt like I needed to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| And because I'm going on vacation later on this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| and the vote has been postponed for a few days, I really felt compelled to say them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| First of all, I'd like to thank you very much for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| This commission and the county school board did something unprecedented in this region's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7791)|
| 2:09:59| and that was have a retreat off-site, talking to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| and establishing a goal that is visionary and important to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| And that was to become the best school system in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| In essence, what you did was establish the bar high, which is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| I told this to Commissioner Shouse the other day, and you may have heard it already here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| Jim Clifton, who is the chairman and CEO of the Gallup polling organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| has written a book called The Coming Jobs War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| And he's been doing very sophisticated international polling since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| And he says that now in a flat world there are 3 billion people in this world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| who would do anything for a good job, just a job that has a chance to feed their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| And there's only 1.2 billion good jobs in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| Now, that's a huge gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| So what is the future of America if we're not prepared to win that coming jobs war?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| And what Clifton says is it's too big for the country as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| It's even too big at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| The only thing you can do is totally align around a common vision at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| And that's what you have tried to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| You got off-site with the school board and tried to align around a common vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| But the rubber meets the road in the implementation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| And I believe you've been presented with, again, first in this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| a five-year financial plan and a visionary strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| And so the other place I want to commend leadership is at the school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7899)|
| 2:11:45| school board, and the Great Schools Partnership level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| I can tell you that the last 15 years as president of Cornerstone Foundation of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| I've had the distinct honor to be involved in education reform organizations at the national level as the chair of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7913)|
| 2:12:02| and at the state level with Majority Leader Frist on the state collaborative on reforming education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| And I will tell you that there are communities in this state and communities around this nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7929)|
| 2:12:17| that would give anything to have the public and private leadership in education that we have in this community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| And the final thing I want to do, and this may surprise you a bit, is I want to commend Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| Even though I disagree with him on how far you've got to go right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| you have to acknowledge that Major Burchett realized you've got to go someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| And he started off not only with a continuation budget, but an investment in early literacy in his own proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| thereby acknowledging that we need to take on this challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| And so I thank you for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| And I hope you will go forward and support the entire five-year budget plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| because that's what's necessary in this coming jobs war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| I want to see if there's anyone else that wants to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| If not, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| This is before we adjourn, and this is nothing serious, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| A few minutes ago, I checked on AP, and at the honoring of Pat Head Summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8004)|
| 2:13:34| I do not find any undue reports toward Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| So I thought, well, maybe I need to look at Fox News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| I don't see anything wrong there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| It's a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| But it's who's covering this that we need to think about for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| I even looked at the Megabus to make sure that there were not any disruptions in the Megabus running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| All of this just to speak about Photo Flash or the person that normally follows us from one of the local newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| Dan Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| He is covering that today in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| so I want everyone to make sure you really corner him about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| and give him a tough time over it when he gets back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| But then the most important thing you need to tell Dan when he is back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| that the cub reporter that's covering for that local newspaper was about three hours late getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8060)|
| 2:14:31| Once again, tomorrow morning at 1030, we're going to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| a forum on community schools, and that's going to be at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| That has been properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| Our next meeting will be at 4 p.m. next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| That's when we'll have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Please call the commission office at 215-2534 and sign up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| We're scheduled to go into session to begin deliberating the budget at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| but we want to give people an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| You will have three minutes at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| If there's no other issues to come before us, we are adjourned until 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| We will meet at 5 p.m. when we will discuss zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8103)|
| 2:15:23| It's 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| It is time now for the zoning portion of the Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8124)|

| 2:16:59| No, that's actually the property next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120529?start=8219)|
