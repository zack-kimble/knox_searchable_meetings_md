| 0:01:17| to look to good solutions that will mean a great deal to all of the citizens and taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=77)|

| 0:01:35| are not good at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| Those who live in the Midwest and experience the horrible devastation and the horrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| realization of what it means to lose their whole town, to lose their homes, to lose their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| landmarks, to lose anything that looked familiar to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=109)|

| 0:02:25| a very troubled part of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=145)|

| 0:02:44| the love that we need to carry in our hearts for all of our fellow men and all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=164)|

| 0:04:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=273)|

| 0:04:42| The budget was in that consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| You all knew that, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Changed a few numbers around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I hope you all don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| So was our raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| 6A is an application for a retailer certificate for Janet E. Roberts Morgan and John L. Roberts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| DBA Little John's Package Store, Inc., 1920 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Two quick things on Mayor's report, but they're both very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| I want to actually present a proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| I won't read it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| But next week, May 14th to May 18th, is Bike to Work Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| And our local transportation planning organization has set up some great activities around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| You can find that on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| If you work for the city and other things, there's even some in county, there's some prizes you can win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| But, obviously, this is an effort to do several things, to cut down on traffic congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| to cut down on the use of fuels, to improve our air quality, to actually encourage physical fitness as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| So I will be doing that a couple days next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| And I hope as many as can will join me, like I said, next week, May 14th to May 18th, is Bike to Work Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| Second item is I want to take time now to recognize those members of the South Waterfront Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| If everyone on that would just come to the front here, please don't be shy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| And maybe you can form a city's council members, too, who are on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| Just come on up and let me brag on you for just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| I won't read through everyone's name here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| We presented everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Maybe go ahead and face the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| We presented everyone plaques and certificates earlier tonight because I didn't want to take too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| But these folks represent the best in a process that I think produced an extraordinary result for the city of Knoxville today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| and for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| They met really over, we've been saying 18 months, but it's a lot closer to two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| with incredible diligence and work and brought some very disparate ideas and concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| and people together to produce a great result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| And as I told them earlier, not only did they produce a great result for the city and for the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| but I think they did in terms of a process and a model for how I hope government can happen going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| So, on behalf of the city, I won't read out everyone's name here, but we really do appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| And the small plaque and certificate we gave you is only a token of what we owe you for your great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| So, if everyone would join me in giving them a big round of applause, we very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you all very much for coming tonight, but mostly for setting a standard for what great community work looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| We really appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| Okay, reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| First, I'd like to announce that we have legislative budget hearings on the budget proposed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| Our first one is Monday, May the 14th, starting at 9 a.m. here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| And our second day of hearings will be Wednesday, May the 16th, starting at 9.30 a.m. here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| Those are open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| At that time, the mayor and his staff will come before council and present their budget discussing those particular issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| Also, I wanted to announce that on Saturday, May 19th, from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| the town hall east is sponsoring a community picnic at the Eastminster Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| We invite all those who are within listening shot of what I'm saying today to please come out and spend a good Saturday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| May 19th, with us at Eastminster Presbyterian Church, 4904 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| 37914 in the Super 6 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Actually, this is a follow-up and I guess a question for the vice mayor about the legislative budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| Yes, Mr. Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| For members of the public who are interested in having input, we actually have a public hearing set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| but are folks also ‑‑ I don't remember how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Do we take comments at all during the hearings, or is it all public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| It is my preference not to during the discussion so that we can, as a council, get well versed on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| and get our questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Then we'll allow the public to make comments afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| And the public hearing is, I think, officially set for 5 o'clock on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| So members of the public, 5 o'clock on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| But I encourage them to come to listen to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| And also, if you have any questions from the public, anyone here in our listening audience, anyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| please send those questions to Bob Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| He'll be glad to present them during the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Bob at bobbecker.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Bob, bobbecker.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Barbara, save us from this insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Well, I don't know that this has much more merit, Mayor Haslam, but in my mind it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Knoxville has had some very good publicity nationwide recently, and Knoxville's had some very good news recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| And I couldn't help but be excited over the weekend that the Lady Vols softball team came through and won the SEC tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=623)|
| 0:10:32| And not only that, but a young lady named Monica Abbott has established a new record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| And I think that's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| We've had some very good relationship with UT over the recent years and partnered with them in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| and just kind of want to thank them for keeping Knoxville on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| It was great to see ESPN and see them continually say, we're in Knoxville, Tennessee, and beating Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| There may be those out there who don't agree with that sentiment, but I was pretty excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| So I just want to congratulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=666)|

| 0:11:10| This Thursday at 4.30 at the Jacobs Building is the second meeting of the public process in the Magnolia Avenue corridor process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| That's right, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| And so that's a joint process put on, sponsored by the MPC, the local East Tennessee chapter of the AIA, their 150th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=684)|
| 0:11:34| So the first meeting was held a few weeks ago, and it was very well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| And so I just want to invite everybody who has an interest in Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| and the improvements in that area to come attend this Thursday at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=703)|

| 0:12:07| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I just want to point you know that the people that are here that are serving want to stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Member of that Downtown Design Review Board, if you would stand up, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| I know there are several folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=738)|

| 0:12:25| We appreciate you all being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Mayor Haslam, I think the composition of that board is just excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| I want to thank you and congratulate you for the composition of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| and for these folks for being willing to spend their time working with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=757)|

| 0:15:20| With everyone, I would ask that you would give us your name, address, and you have five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| and we will try to hold you to no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Mayor, could you repeat that about who is signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=930)|

| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Mayor, members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight and speak about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| I am Bill Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I'm the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| I live at 1848 Stonebrook Drive in Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| The topic tonight is our vegetation management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I would tell you that that program has three objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| To ensure that we provide safe electric service to our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| to ensure that we maintain as high a reliability as possible to our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| and at the same time to maintain the health of the tree along our power lines as we trim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| and as we operate our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| In order to do that, we utilize a trimming method known as the lateral trim method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| It is a method recommended by the National Arbor Day Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| or then National Arbor Day Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| That is the organization that names the City of Knoxville as a Tree City USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| It is the organization that has named us as a Treeline USA utility every year since 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| because of our conformance with those trimming standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| and compliance with their requirements and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| That trimming method does a number of things in addition to simply ensuring that the tree is trimmed in a proper manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| The trimming method allows us to ensure that the separation between the wires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| and the tree limbs themselves are sufficient to provide safe service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| As you know, tree limbs that come in contact with electric wires can conduct electricity to the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| and in doing so, there is a chance of electrical shock or electrocution to any individual, child, pet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| or whatever that might be in contact with that tree at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| In addition to that, any contact by a tree limb, even momentarily, can create power outages on our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| and provide a great deal of inconvenience to customers and to the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Obviously, major storms can bring trees down and limbs across those wires, resulting in long-term outages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| and efforts on our part to restore power that can be rather long in duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and very inconvenient for our customers, both short-term and long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| The method that we use, as I said, is approved by National Arbor Day Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Again, their main focus is the focus on the health of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| That requires that the trimming be done at a lateral cut in order to ensure that the short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1089)|
| 0:18:18| and long-term health of the tree is in its best possible environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| We do know and recognize that that does create problems sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| in that it doesn't always result in a visually attractive tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| But there is no way, oftentimes, given the close proximity of a tree to an electric line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| given the size of that tree, that it can be trimmed even to these standards recommended by arborists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| and still create an attractive appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| In those cases, we've worked with our customers on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| We've offered to remove those trees rather than to prune them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And where the customer agrees, we've done so and provided replacement trees to their satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Those trees then being replanted or planted away from the power line so that they don't continue to be a problem for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| or to continue to create a hazard or a situation where we have to continue to trim on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| We appreciate your all's input tonight and throughout the course of our operations of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| We've met and talked with a number of you all in the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| We've had a lot of input from our customers, Mr. Silverstein, not the least of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| We've made a number of improvements in the last 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| and we think those improvements are in the best interest of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Many of those have come about as a direct result of Mr. Silverstein's suggestions and, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| criticisms at times, and, again, we think that's been helpful to us and to our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Some of the changes we've made have actually come about as a result of conversations with some of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| including Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Some of those improvements, and I won't go into all of them tonight, but they run the whole gamut of the tree trim program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| We have changed the way we manage the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| A year ago, that program was one of many functions under a department known as overhead construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Today, that program is managed out of a department whose sole responsibility is the vegetation management activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| There is nothing else that that manager and those personnel have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| or be distracted from other than dealing with the tree trim program itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| About 20 more seconds, Mr. Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| We've also improved the way we communicate with our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| We have a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| We now use letters, clearly identifying with them in more detail when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| and where we're going to be trimming and what we expect to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| You can go to our website at any time, look at where our tree trim crews are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| and where they expect to be within the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| We've made a number of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| We expect to continue to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Input such as we've received from Mr. Silverstein has been valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Input that we've received from City Council continues to be valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| and our commitment is to continue to work with our customers as best we can on this and all other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1273)|
| 0:21:22| Mayor Haslam, members of City Council, my name is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| My address is 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| I'm speaking tonight in support of Resolution 11E on behalf of the Committee to Save Knoxville's Trees from KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| a group of over 65 property owners residing in over 20 Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Members include the presidents of some of Knoxville's largest neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| including West Hills, Dean Hill, Sequoia Hills, Kingston Pike, Westmoreland, Timbercrest, and Lowness Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| I'm a native Knoxvillian and have lived in West Hills for almost 46 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| I have three degrees from UT, including a law degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| This is my first appearance at a City Council meeting, but I'm here tonight because Knoxville has a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| and I believe that City Council can help solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| Before addressing a few of the issues regarding KUB's tree trimming policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| I want to thank City Council for responding to the urgent pleas by the public who have asked you to please use your influence with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| and to persuade them to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| This committee is a perfect example of a grassroots organization that has petitioned their public officials for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| You have responded, and we are grateful for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| We believe that with this resolution, you are sending KUB a message that is loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| KUB can do better and must make some adjustments in how they treat some of Knoxville's greatest natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| our trees, and in how they respect the legitimate rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| The issue before you tonight is excessive tree trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| We recognize that KUB must maintain its power lines and that some trees must be trimmed and even removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| However, we believe that KUB, through its contractors, are going too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| KUB has greatly exaggerated the connection between trees in the trim zone and power outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| KUB's own statistics prove that squirrels cause more power outages than trees in the trim zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| No one likes power outages, but there will always be power outages caused by many things besides trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| No amount of tree trimming will prevent some trees from falling down entirely during catastrophic and rare weather events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| If anything, some trees are more likely to fall down after they have been mutilated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Also, many of the trees that do fall down are far enough away from the power lines, outside the trim zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| that they were not subject to tree trimming in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| It is not reasonable or necessary to cut every tree near a power line just because there is a slim chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| that any particular tree may cause a power outage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| There is also the issue of KUB's supervision of its contractors, who often are from out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| and whose employees often do not speak or understand English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Too frequently, these crews are not following proper tree trimming policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| They often cannot identify dogwood or redbud trees, which are not supposed to ever be cut, according to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| It is not right that KUB has delegated to these crews the total authority and discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| as to how someone's private property is to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Another serious problem is that no actual notice is provided to the property owners before cutting or removing the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| Frequently, people come home to find their trees have been badly mutilated or removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| and they don't even know who did it or why it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| In Chattanooga, an environmental company, not the tree cutters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| has the responsibility of identifying trees that need to be trimmed or removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| and they contact each property owner in advance and discuss the situation before the trees are cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| KUB needs to change its attitude and philosophy towards trees and tree cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| KUB should seek to cut as few trees as possible, and only when truly necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| and to cut as little as possible when trees must be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| KUB's current objective appears to be to cut as much as possible or to remove trees entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| Right now, KUB views trees only as problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| despite their public claims to follow national best practices that help preserve the health of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| However, having the proper policies mean nothing if they are not actually practiced in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| From recent public comments by KUB's top management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| it is clear that they still do not believe there is a problem, and therefore there is nothing to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| KUB has no problem with cutting trees in half from top to bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| and freely admits its program results in ugly trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| This distressing result is neither reasonable nor necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| We have all seen far too many ugly, damaged trees in all parts of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| With all of the recent KUB rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| we must wonder if the $5 million per year spent by KUB on tree trimming is being spent wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| We hope that this resolution will deliver a message to KUB that it can no longer ignore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| since it is now coming from City Council as well as from many of its other customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| We thank you again for your support of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| and we urge you to continue to tell KUB's management, both publicly and privately, to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| This problem can be solved, and we all hope that this resolution will go a long way towards solving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| But if it doesn't do the job, we will be coming back to you soon to see what else might be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| I thank you very much for your consideration of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Jim Cortese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| Mayor Haslam, members of City Council, it's good to see all of y'all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| It's nice not to be in the direct political foray on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| I am a certified arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I'm a board-certified master arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I'm one of two in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Rumor has it that I'm a hired gun for KUB, and depending on who hires me is which side of the fence I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| It so happens that in this particular dogfight, I am a volunteer at the present moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| and I was a volunteer when I first got involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| I was asked to go out to the West Hills Neighborhood Association to talk to the West Hills Homeowners Association about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| The problem was that I don't think they necessarily liked what I had to say because I told them what I think is the reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| that we have trees planted in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| That's the ultimate problem that Mr. Silverstein is alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| If we didn't have wrong trees in the wrong place, we wouldn't have the problem we've got today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| Forty years ago, West Hills did not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| It was farm fields and grasslands, and it was an entirely different type of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| And with the coming of the late 60s and the 70s, development started taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| Power lines went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Infrastructure went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| They planted little one-inch diameter seedlings to beautify the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Today, 40 years later, those same trees are growing into the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Trees are a renewable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| They're not something that's going to be here forever, as much as I wish it were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| It is my opinion that what we're faced with today is sort of like Rhett Butler when he was leading the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| in buckboard and gone with the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| If you remember when Atlanta was burning and the scarlet was on the buckboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and Melanie, who's pregnant, was on the buckboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| and they were trying to take that thing through downtown Atlanta burning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and the horse was rearing its little legs and wouldn't go through downtown Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| So Rhett ripped off a piece of scarlet skirt, wrapped it over the horse's head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| and dragged it through, and the horse went right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Today, KUB has made a radical change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| I got involved with this because I had made some recommendations after talking to West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| I sat down and played a game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| If I was KUB, what would I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And I made a list of possible things that might make a difference because homeowners call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| and say, can't you go do something about these trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Well, I can't because I don't do power line clearance pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| I leave that to people who do that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| But I did make a list, and then they took those back and talked to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and now they have hired me to come in as a consultant to try and set up some experimental plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| The covering of the head of the horse to go through Atlanta is the fact that when you have a bureaucracy as big as KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1797)|
| 0:30:07| and trying to make them make a change like that is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| They can't stop in a dime and turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| But they can start laying the foundations for making the changes that we all want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| because we all live in Knoxville and want it to be a prettier place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Ultimately, they have made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| As Mr. Elmore said, they pulled the line clearance out of the overhead construction department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| and made it vegetation management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So that you've got one person who's dealing with all this particular issue of dealing with power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| They've also put one person on every crew that speaks English, and they wear a vest that says, talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| Lastly, they've spent an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to change the way they communicate with homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| It is my opinion that the tip of the iceberg is where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| I can live with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| It's not going to bother me one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| But it is my opinion that it's simply going to give Mr. Silverstein a bully pulpit to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| and beat city council and beat KUB on the head the next time that KUB doesn't exactly follow Mr. Silverstein's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| interpretation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I recommend that you all consider having a general tree discussion, a separate meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| to discuss not just KUB trees, but to deal with the issue of developers planting trees near power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1889)|
| 0:31:38| I'll give you the example of Millington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| And it's not to make Millington Park look bad, but they've only been there about five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| And they have 21 eastern white pines and eight pin oak trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| And every one of them is about five years from being in a large overhead power line on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| The problem was it's not KUB and how they prune it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| The problem is that we planted trees where they shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Even our own city has planted sycamore trees within the growth range of those overhead lines on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| I think that there's a bigger issue here than just KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| So, with that, I'll leave it to the wisdom of your collective group to decide whether you want to pass a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1935)|
| 0:32:24| That, in all sincerity, I don't think it's going to change anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| because I think KUB has already committed themselves to making some very wholesale changes as we go into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Okay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I don't pretend to speak for all members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| but I'm certain that all members of council have received phone calls from Mr. Silverstein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| and have taken what he said to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| And, you know, I've and probably other members of council have had productive conversations with Bill Elmore from KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| and I also highly regard Jim Cortese's opinion on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| The way I see it is, and as I've explained to folks, the resolution does not carry the weight of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| I don't know what, if anything, council can do after this matter is done tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| but there are always ways to look to improving your situation, improving your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| And, you know, KUB didn't win awards for not doing something well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| They've, you know, opinions may differ on what they do, but they've won awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| But, you know, it's a continual process that everybody up here goes through looking for ways to improve yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| And hopefully this resolution will pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| and KUB will continue to look at its policies and its ways to better itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I just want to tell Mr. Elmore and KUB that I appreciate your willingness to listen to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| as we try to convey our constituents' concerns, which are your rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| And, you know, I've looked at some of the situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and I've tried to figure out what the solutions might be and I don't have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| but I know there's some people that have given you some pretty good suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| and I think some improvements have been made and I think, you know, in the future some more can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| Some of the things you've changed have been pointed out by some of the folks that have been critical of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| and I guess it does take a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| As I just wanted to point this out, Mr. Al Acker, who a lot of us know and respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| pointed out that he's lived in a lot of parts of the United States and that KUB does a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| and I as well have lived elsewhere and know that you do do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Having said that, you know, we can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I had a suggestion from Dr. Fuhrer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| I'm under the impression that next year there's going to be a power line arborist convention here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2112)|
| 0:35:21| And, Mr. Elmore, I was wondering if you would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| or interested in conducting some kind of a symposium for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| You know, you guys put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| And while these outside experts are here, we could come to some sort of conclusions on what we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| and if we can do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| But I think education and an educated public and, you know, involvement would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Would you be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Dr. Fuhrer and I have had a couple of brief conversations about that very thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| and I think it is an opportunity for us to sit down with some experts in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| in different parts of the country and allow our customers to come in and be a part of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I think it would be a very good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| and we'd certainly be willing to work in that regard and try to make that come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| And to Mr. Silverstein, I really appreciate anybody that takes the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and is highly motivated about an issue like this and gets out and does what he does, has my respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| So I just appreciate, you know, all the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and hopefully we can all work together to do it as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| And I wanted to ask if Mr. Wetzel had any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| You might not or you might, but, you know, sort of our expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| That's all, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Well, I just want to comment that I appreciate everyone who's been engaged in these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| I think it's been almost a year now since initially there was a little situation which arose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| and actually it arose in West Hills and Mr. Silverstein happened to be on the spot at the time that it occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2221)|
| 0:37:11| and it distressed a number of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| And I have to thank him for drawing the attention about that particular incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| which I think has helped us all to engage in some very productive discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| And because I realized that this was such a sensitive issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| and so many people were very alarmed about some occurrences that they had personally experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| it seemed a wise thing at the time to actually talk with, I believe, at that time, Mr. Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| it was you were there, Ms. Roach was there, Samantha was there, Susan Edwards, if I recall correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| and you all were kind enough to arrange a meeting where I could sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| and talk with you about the things that I was hearing and that neighbors were experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| So out of that have come a number of very good, positive moves on the part of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2284)|
| 0:38:16| I think we kind of identified the communication issue as being, could be better, as everyone is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2296)|
| 0:38:26| And I think that communication issue has gotten much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| I think there have been a number of opportunities for KUB to speak with community groups, people to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| There is an individual there who is now the contact person if anyone needs to speak with someone at KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| and it's their sole responsibility to take care of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Particularly, I think it's been very helpful to have someone who can speak English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| It's not the fault of those folks who are out there working who are subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| but unfortunately they are not in a position to communicate well with the community and the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| And this has been a tremendous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| And I think it's probably helped people to understand what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| I think the letters have been of enormous value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| And I remember looking at that letter and kind of giving it a once over, and the envelope is a plain white envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| And this is kind of my observation that I get a lot of this stuff in the mail and it kind of goes into file 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| So actually we made a decision to have something across the front of the envelope that indicates this is in regard to tree cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| and it will be your trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| So I very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| I very much appreciate Mr. Silverstein's involvement because had he not brought it to the attention of a number of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| I don't think we would have become involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| and I don't think we would have had that opportunity to sit down and work with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| I understand the need for trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I think we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| But I think the KUB administration, as well as the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| I hope understands that, you know, we're in a position of answering the phone and getting an e-mail, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| that involves, you know, people who have some property values they're very concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| And, you know, a lot of our neighborhoods are old neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Mr. Cortese has touched on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| And we love to live in those old neighborhoods because they have a special beauty and a special value to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| But, unfortunately, they are the neighborhoods that seem to be most challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| So my observation has been it's easy, if we're working with a new development, a new neighborhood, to make good recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| But probably a little bit of different sensitivity can be exercised where we're working in old neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| where there can be some selectivity and some really property owner involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| So I think that this resolution is just an opportunity to bring this discussion to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| I like the idea of the symposium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| I would like to encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| It's not part of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| But I really personally encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| I think it would be good for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| And I think it would be good for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| So I hope that that will be taken to heart and that opportunity will be available to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| You know, when resolutions like this come up, the one thing I tend to look for and I look at is what are we trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2499)|
| 0:41:50| and what is our result and where is our goal, where are we trying to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| And I think Councilman Frost stated it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| People need to understand that a resolution is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| It doesn't have any force of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| You can't turn around tomorrow and take it down to KUB and stand in front of your yard and say you can't cut that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| City Council has passed a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| So I hope people understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Sometimes when we pass these things or we entertain them, people go away with the feeling that the problem has been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| You know, City Council has done something substantial that's going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| While we may have voiced an opinion, to me, where are we going with regards to our result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| I remember last year sometime being at a Keeping Off the Beautiful Board of Directors meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| and getting a presentation from someone in your vegetation department about the tree cutting program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| when people were talking about it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I think it was a very good presentation with regards to your rationale, why you were doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| what you were trying to do and how you were trying to change the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| So I would hope that maybe something like that could occur very near in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| maybe through a council workshop or something of that nature so that council can see that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| and people from the public can come and engage in discussions about next steps here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| I'm looking for trying to see what do we do to come together to see how we make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| You know, and right now the resolution is a nice statement, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| if we're looking at a symposium next year, you know, we're still going to have tree cutting going on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| You know, so, Bill, I'd like to at least ask you if you could get your people to maybe make a copy of that presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| distribute it to council, and maybe we entertain, have someone from your office contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| so we can entertain the possibility of having a discussion or a workshop about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| so we can kind of talk about next steps and where we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I think that's something you guys would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| That's something I'd like to see done that's very concrete with regards to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| And I get concerned when resolutions like this pop up because we're not very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| It almost looks like we're saying whoever is the subject of the resolution is bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| or is doing something bad or something intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| I do think KUB is trying to do what it thinks is best for the safety of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| and what it thinks is best for property owners and trying to deal with industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| And we have to make sure that the educational piece that goes along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| as we continue to tweak the process, I think you would admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| and we all admit there's no perfect process, but how do we tweak it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| We've got to tweak it through some interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| So hopefully you can get that presentation to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| and would you consider maybe sometime in the future coming to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| maybe in one of our workshops and having a more in-depth discussion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| If you saw that presentation about a year ago, we probably made some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| and the presentations that we've been making more recently to some of the community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| and interested neighborhoods would be reflective of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| I will get you a copy and provide to all council members the most recent presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| that we've been using in these kind of vegetation management programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And then once you've had a chance to look at that and review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| I'd be happy to work with you any way we can to meet your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| And it may be even more effective as opposed to after we get there to having a council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Maybe if you guys could, maybe I don't know how many neighborhood groups you've met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| You heard Mr. Silverstein list several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| I don't know if you guys have been to each and every one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| but you may want to send your troops out to go to these neighborhood organizations that he has listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| you know, who have expressed some concerns and interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| and that's to be a part of their monthly or bi-monthly meeting to give a presentation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| The one thing I can tell you is we have never turned down a neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| or a community group for this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| We'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| And what I would like to see, as opposed to waiting on them to contact you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| why don't you all have somebody get the list from Mr. Silverstein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| and maybe contact those groups and just ask, are you interested or would you like us to come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Could you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I think we have basically provided that kind of an opportunity and offer in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| and we'll be happy to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| You know, one of the reasons my name is not on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| because I really struggled with just whether or not I would support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| because I just thought, hey, you know, it's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| It sends the impression that we're doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| but it's really just a resolution that's going to be another piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| You know, and that's why I'm not on it as a supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| And after hearing this discussion, I don't have a problem, you know, voting for it to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| but I want to make sure that we do some positive things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| because it doesn't do you guys any good to keep seeing stuff like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| but nobody may be willing to get in there with you guys to figure out how do we make it better and help you out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| because you guys are doing a good job, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Mr. Elmo, I just want to ask you something else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| This question has come up a number of times, particularly from older neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| where you have 100-year-old big trees, and they're way, way from the power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| and if one falls over, it could potentially hit a wire and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| I understand in the past that there was some sort of fee sharing process where streets or circuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2806)|
| 0:46:56| or neighborhoods or parts of neighborhoods could work with you on doing underground utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| And furthermore, I've heard both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Is it even feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Is there any cost savings in the long run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Is there anything available for, say, a street or a circuit or a part of a neighborhood to work with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| We have worked with neighborhoods generally on a street-by-street basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| to look at the feasibility of going underground with the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| That obviously eliminates the need for ongoing tree trimming and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| To be quite honest with you, while we're willing to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and while we have had some limited interest by community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| generally, once the price is determined, it is not attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| It is a very expensive cost to go underground when a system is already existing and overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| If you're putting in a new system, it's not that much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| Its incrementally cost is not that much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| But if you've got a system in place today and you're having to abandon it and go underground, it is very, very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| And most of our feasibility studies and most of the proposals that we have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| the customers have turned it down on the basis of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| But, yes, it is an option that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Just real quickly, I appreciate what Mr. Silverstein has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| I appreciate the comments by Mr. Elmore and Mr. Cortese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| It's been a really good discussion, fascinating, good insight, and it seems as though we've moved ourselves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| I really resonate with what Vice Mayor Brown has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| I guess I hesitated to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| I will definitely support this, but I hesitated to be a sponsor of this because I guess, Mr. Elmore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| you very easily could have experienced this as a kind of reprimand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| But I guess you understand that this is the rough and tumble of democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| and so you have entered into this conversation with a good spirit, and we have a good outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| Perhaps there's another way to introduce conversations of this kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Some people would be very cynical and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| you would not really come to the table unless something like this were to be introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| But I doubt that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| But I appreciate just how you've conducted yourself and willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| And this was a good conversation, so thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Seeing no further lights, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Hargraves Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| in an amount not to exceed $1,425,000 for professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| and the preparation of all necessary documentation related to field work, schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and permitting for certain south waterfront public improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Mr. Hill, I want to make sure that I understand fully what we're approving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| This contract is for a five-year time span with Hargraves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Well, it's using the phase one public priorities that came out of the implementation strategy of the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3027)|
| 0:50:36| So, yes, it's the zero to five-year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| So they will be in our contract employment for five years to oversee that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Well, for this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| they're saying they're going to be done within nine months of the written notice to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| So this will get us to the point of having all of the permit applications readied and sent in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| So it pretty much dresses us up and gets us ready to go with the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| And once we obtain those permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| we would then be in a position to schedule through our whatever capital resources we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| the actual construction documentation and the bid letting after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| So this is really a nine-month contract to get us through the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| the field work and the schematic design and the permitting for those zero to five-year projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| So we're not committing to any construction money at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| nor are we going so far as to have final design and construction documentation prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| So the million four contract is for nine months of work to basically set out all of the permitting for five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3106)|
| 0:51:59| Whether we can afford that or not, I think yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| What it's getting us is a minimum of $30 million worth of construction projects to that level of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| Ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I have not read all the legal language in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| If the city would come to a project, say, that was in year four on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| and conditions had changed, which things sometimes do over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| would we anticipate that we would need to hire them and pay them again to redo that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| Or is there any provision for them to come back and do further work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| or at nine months they check out and we're finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| It gives us the option of whether we want to hire them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Quite frankly, we want to be as cost-efficient as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| If we get to the point where we have the permits obtained and the schematic design completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| we may well decide to hire, on a firm-by-firm basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| the best qualified firm to do the construction documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| and just move forward with the letting of the bid for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| So as much as we like our grades, we only want to use them when it's to our advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and makes the best economic sense to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| And their commitment is to complete the schematic design, permitting, et cetera, for all of phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| whether that takes nine months or 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Well, it will take nine months to do the work in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| It certainly is going to take at least five years to build all of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Yes, so you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| If for some reason the permitting doesn't happen as quickly as they expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| or the schematic drawings, I mean, there's always delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| their commitment under this contract is completion of the specified work for everything in phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| not a nine-month timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| And we're not paying them for nine months, but if it's not done, we have to pay them some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| So you're committed to do everything that's specified here to get us to that point with phase one projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| That's a good question, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| I appreciate your diligence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I just wanted to point out to council that we didn't just sort of say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| our grades did a good job on the first phase, the first batch of work that they did in the first contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| therefore we're going to hire them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| We went through a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| We put out a request for qualifications, and the city's purchasing director worked with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| And, of course, Dave headed that up, and there was a group of review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| or selection committee that worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| And we had four good applicants or respondents, I should say, to the RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| And it was a tough decision, but our grades really stood out, not because of what they'd done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| although that was certainly in their favor that we'd had a good successful relationship with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| but because of what they'd done in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| and the way they really made the case for how they were going to perform this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| So it was, again, a very competitive situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| and we had four quality firms or teams of firms that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| We just felt like this group would do the best job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| With regards to page 17, I want to make sure I understand something on the potential sub-consultants list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| That list, if I understand the categories correctly, and I guess, Dave, you're the one that can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| the bottom line with regards to this is these are a list of potential sub-consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| but any consulting work or work that's going to be done will have to come through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| We're going to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Why does it say potential candidates subject to RFP process then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| Well, when we talked with Hargraves, they were selected as a lead firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| and we're contracting only with a lead firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| And the lead firm is then expected to hire all of the subcontractors needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| with a clear understanding that an overwhelming majority of that subcontracting would go to local firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| and they would also work toward a goal of at least 10% disadvantaged business enterprise participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| and we're working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| The other thing I did not want to do was to bring this before council without any of you having any idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| of who they're looking at in terms of hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| So this is not a complete list, and these are not confirmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| but I wanted to at least give you a flavor of what kind of expertise is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| and to demonstrate to you that there have been serious discussions with local firms that will do most of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| So I guess I'm back to my initial question, and let me rephrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Why do we say potential candidates subject to an RFP process if there's not going to be an RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| What I heard you just say, I think, is Hargraves is going to, I guess, pick the subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| We're only picking the lead firm, and we did that through an RFQ process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| From here on out, Hargraves is responsible for the hiring and firing of all subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| and will not be subject to city procurement requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Okay, so we're dancing around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Let me hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Why does it say subject to RFP process on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| I think maybe it's simply referring to the original RFQ process that led to the selection of Hargraves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| I apologize if that's unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| So Hargraves is not going to go through an RFP process either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| You say this is not a complete list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| When will the list be expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Well, I think they want to know that council is going to authorize the contract before they spend a lot more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| But within, I would say, a week or two, we should know exactly what firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| and to what extent they'll be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| So if in a week or two we're going to know what firms are going to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| in that period of time when are they going to expand the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| and then will it down to what firms are going to be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| You said this is not an exhaustive list of potential candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| And I understand Hargraves is responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| But if they're going to expand this list of potential candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| and then cull it down within a week, that's not much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And I guess I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Well, I think this can be an evolving process throughout the nine-month period of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| They could find out that they need some kind of expertise six months from now and hire that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| and that's their prerogative under this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| They don't have to ask the city for permission to hire a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| And at the same time, if there are problems with performance with one of the firms they do hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| they can fire them without our permission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| I don't mean difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| I hear you loud and clear that we're basically giving Hargraves, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| the go-ahead to do whatever you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| I guess what I'm trying to get to, and you were very clear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| they're not going to be subject to the city's procurement policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| which is interesting because Mr. McCall came, I guess, a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| a couple of council meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| and said this is a prime example of how the new DBE policy could be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| But, yeah, I just hear you say we're not going to have them deal with it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| So that was used as a prime example of what could happen with regards to disadvantaged businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| women-owned business, minority-owned business possibly being part and parcel of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| But we've just allowed them not to have to be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| nor do we have any input from what you just tell me with them with regards to at least consideration of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| Are we at least going to have them consult with Mr. Strickland's office or end purchasing with regards to their list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| Let me jump in here, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| We've actually, just to kind of jump ahead of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Boyce has already come up with a list of potential DBEs who can be potential contractors on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| So that, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| so that while Hargraves will have, ultimately, they're the people who have the right to hire and fire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| we have let them know that they're certain that we want to fulfill at least that 10% goal, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| And we're working hard toward providing them a list of DBEs who can play in each one of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| And we already have the preliminary list done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| See, that's what I was getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| When will that list be expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| If they're going to decide within a week, sounds like what you just told me, Mary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| that's a little more on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| We're compiling a list to get them to say, here are some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Boyce is already working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Boyce already kind of has a preliminary list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Boyce is working with, and I'm probably going to get a call from Tank Strickland tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| but I mentioned his name and haven't talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| But is someone going to work with him and Jocelyn on the list that they've come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| We have given Hargraves the list of both the city's DBE list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| and they also are working off of state Tennessee Department of Transportation DBE list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| So we've been talking ever since the time that Hargraves was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Boyce Evans was on the selection committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| and we have been working back and forth talking about how to best utilize those DBEs that have been listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| If I can, as it goes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| maybe I guess council will be giving a list of who else is going to be chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| I just thought it was really some great articles recently about the World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| and it showed how truly that was just a great process that involved a lot of folk and local talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| And we've got an opportunity now with a very, very big mammoth process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| and project that we can involve a lot of folk, I think, who can be involved here to show not only what good work we do here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| Knoxville, but what good work we do here in Knoxville, notwithstanding our gender or our race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I just have a question in regard to this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Have these firms been contacted, or have they contacted the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| How is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| It's been a little bit of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| During the RFQ process, we asked firms to indicate that if they weren't selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| would they be interested in being a subcontractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| So those names were made available to Hargraves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Hargraves is also familiar with the community, and they've been making some calls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| And I know they've talked to more than just the folks that you see listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Well, I chanced to be in a conversation this week where a particular firm, I don't see them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| but I know that they had had a contact from, I didn't know if it was Hargraves or the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| but I was just curious to know how this list had been created, developed, and had come to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| But you're saying that everyone who's been contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| or has been in contact with the city is not necessarily showing up here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Oh, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| I mean, there are a lot of firms that are not listed here that have talked with Hargraves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3801)|

| 1:03:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3825)|

| 1:03:57| Questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| I guess they're both more comments than questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| One is sort of a general about all three plans, and actually a lot that we're doing now with our plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| which is sort of putting an emphasis on alleys, on saying, you know, we want entrance on the alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| You know, we're trying to reorient some of our inner city neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| where alleys exist towards alleys that have been underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| And I'm pleased that that's showing up in the budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Sometimes we do these and these become sort of just out there things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I want to just sort of say to my colleagues that I'm not convinced that that's necessarily the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| that I haven't heard enough of the cost benefits talked about to be good about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and just, you know, toss it out if people have thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Second question on, again, I'll ask this about all three plans, is sort of the implementation part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| Again, I think there's some great potential in the Broadway Central Emory Place small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| But, again, my question, my sense is having leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| having somebody who's thinking about how do we make this happen is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| So I'm going to sort of ask, who's the person whose job it is to think about this on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| I think it would be a couple of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I think some of that would fall under Bill Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Some of it will ultimately fall under Madeline's as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| I mean, we've had this discussion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| I know you'd like to say, here's the point person for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| But I don't know that we can, like I said, like what we've done with South Waterfront with Dave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| we can afford to have one person that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| It's a fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| If somebody's not responsible, then if everybody's responsible, nobody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| And I trust the people you're mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I guess it would feel a little better to me to know one of those is sort of the point person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| And we don't have something where either of them, and I know they'll be talking, would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| well, I thought the other one had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| So, you know, like to cover that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| Fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Mayor, you said some of it may be Madeline's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Which Madeline were you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| In that case, Madeline O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| And the only reason I asked that is because I know that Madeline Weil works with Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| and that she might very well be involved in this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| So I thought it might be, just for my own sake, helpful to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| Both is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| But the other Madeline, as opposed to Bill Lyons, was Madeline O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| I just also want to express my appreciation for the work that's gone into this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| and the plan that's coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Of course, those two work together, the redevelopment plan and the small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| And while they're not identical areas, there's a lot of overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| And we know as we move forward that a lot of implementation work will sort of integrate both plans together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| And, again, we recognize the work of Councilman Woodhull and Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| and the Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Emory Place Central Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| all the work that's led us in this direction and certainly with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| because they started this small area plan even before the work of that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| So I think all together it's pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| And we're moving an important part of our central city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| I just wanted to sort of support Councilman Becker's comments on the alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| And he told me he lives in an alley, but he's not so sure about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| On and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Alley cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| But I do appreciate that because once you go down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| you better know what you're getting into in the cost, the paving and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| It's quite an undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| So I, in the future, would like to hear and have a little more discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I was just going to, without getting much further into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I think it's a good discussion to have because I think that it's one of the things we talked about very early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| with the new infill guidelines that if we don't address it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| we're going to have a problem down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| So I kind of see the benefit of doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| I'm so glad to hear that Councilman Becker lives near an alley and not in an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4099)|
| 1:08:28| I have one other question, and I'm just, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| I guess maybe it's for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| It's the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| All those in favor of 11H, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4124)|

| 1:08:56| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Didn't we approve this before or something similar to this where I asked the question about the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| and the utilization of empowerment zone money and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| Or is this something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| The second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| The second step of doing it, is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Help me understand what you mean by second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| Dr. Lyons may want to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| This is actually, thank you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| This is actually the MPC part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| I think this is not the actual plan was, in fact, and we had that dialogue last council meeting, was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| And maybe I can turn it over to Mr. Donaldson if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| This is sort of engaging MPC who's working in concert with us and KCDC on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| Because the previously approved Broadway Central Emory Place Small Area Plan is embedded in the I-275 Central Corridor Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4186)|
| 1:10:00| and that went through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| We also wanted to bring the Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| And in doing that, we got a concurrent zoning application which identified a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| but fairly significant textual problem with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| We had used some old language about low-density residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| and we have a zoning case on this evening's agenda which does not meet low-density criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| So we have changed the Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan very slightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| re-identifying a small two- or three-block area from low-density to moderate-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| and that enables the zoning application to meet and conform with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| So two things are going on, including the MPC and the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| and concurrently making a very small modification to allow for this rezoning request that is consistent with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4264)|
| 1:11:15| but it was with the intent of the plan, but it was inconsistent with the language that had previously been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4275)|
| 1:11:25| To answer your question, or do you have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| It sounds like one hand didn't know what the other was doing, but I guess we got there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| I'm done. My light's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| This was one we talked about two or four weeks ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| So I asked that question about implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Who's doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Nothing's changed on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Speaking of alleys, on page 19 of the plan, the alley on the left is out my back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| It's all nice and neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| The one on the right, I don't think it's in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| It wouldn't be that ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| It's probably out of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| And would somebody please give Vice Mayor Brown a sedative to temper the effects of that caffeine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Yes, I feel it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| 11J is a resolution adopting the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Plan, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Two questions on this, if I can find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| One is, again, just who's the person who's going to be thinking about implementing this on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| Well, I think we're, and we do have one person sign up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| I think we're still at what I'd call the planning stage of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| I don't think there really is an implementation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Right now, again, Dr. Lyons is in charge of taking us to this next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| which I would call everything from how are we going to get some additional funds to work on the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| to how are we going to coordinate with UT, to how are we going to coordinate with the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| and other interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| So Bill is definitely the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| And, like I said, I'd call us still much more in the planning than the implementation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| We will go to the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| We have one person sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Rob, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Rob Dancerow, 1302 White Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| I just wanted to say thank you, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Thank you to all the council people for pushing this project forward for us over the last three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| Finally getting some wheels and getting some traction the way I see it with this plan coming into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| I think that there are a few people that deserve a lot of credit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I think that Mark Donaldson and Jeff Welch and Renee Davis have done a fantastic job with moving this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| and getting all the stakeholders involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I think this task force had more than 30 people on it that were the advisory committee for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| So there's been a great deal of participation all the way across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| And I just wanted to talk about next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| You know, we're at a point now where this is the vision, and we're talking about how do we get to design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| and who are going to be the people that are going to lead this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| And the relationships that have been formed from this working group have been just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| People are at the table that never would have talked to each other in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| And so now we're at a point where we're talking about doing design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| and hopefully over the course of this year we'll actually be able to do a physical design for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And, you know, we need to keep the eye on the prize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| which is July 2009 when TDOT's done with Smart Fix 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| and we can start looking at arterials leading into downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| and figure out how to get this Cumberland Avenue project on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| so we can start immediately after that finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I just want to echo what Mr. Dansgrove said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| The advisory committee, I think, did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| We recognized earlier the work of the South Waterfront Oversight Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| and this was another group that performed a similar function and I think did a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| The mayor mentioned working on additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Just so council will know, there's no guarantees when you apply for funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| but the TPO technical committee at their meeting this morning had on their agenda an application for funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4508)|
| 1:15:17| TCSP federal funding pot of money, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| that may fund some of the design work that Mr. Dansgrove was talking about, the mayor, the planning work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| The mayor was referring to a tune of maybe $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| So we're hopeful that's competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| We don't know if we'll get that one, but we're hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| So, as the mayor said, we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Now, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| It's a really long and detailed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| One, just again, this is more common than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| On page 1-1, sort of in the middle, it says the urban design plan, and I'm just going to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| It says, while a market analysis has not been conducted for this study to determine its development potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| the design plan calculated the potential for so much housing, so much commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| Actually, I was struck by that because I've seen that in some other plans where we've had people look at, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| we could do a lot here, and we look at what I'll call the planning side and not the economic side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| And at some level, I'd like to recommend that we be more willing to do some of those market studies to say, is this going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| I don't think it's of value to say to people, we can build a great thing here when the market won't sustain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| So to toss that out, maybe we haven't gotten to that stage, but I'd support doing that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| I think that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| And all the plans in the world aren't great unless there's demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| I think you will see that next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Again, hopefully as we try to get some more money from other sources, that's one of the things that will be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| And as you know, it's one of the things we relied on the most in the South Waterfront Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| So well said, and I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Okay, anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4617)|

| 1:20:55| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| This is the typical first reading ordinance that we get at budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| and this is not that overhaul that was discussed when we had our budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| It looks like what we've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| but when we get to that point of the overhaul that I think Ms. Hatfield spoke of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| I think hopefully we will engage in workshops and a good discussion about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| That's a great point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| You are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| But, Vicki, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| You are right, but it's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| This is just our typical ordinance to do the class comp changes we do every July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| We are putting together a proposal that we'll be bringing to the administration to take a look at very soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| if civil service were asked to do the overhaul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| and that's something we'd do and engage in those conversations at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| As I said then, I really think that that's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Someone mentioned earlier about our local natural resources and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| This is going to deal with our main resource, and that is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| As we deal with that process, I think we need to go about it and not take it lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| And I think due to the size of what we're taking on, I think it will be a pretty big endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| You're talking about 1,600 to 1,700 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Any other questions on that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4935)|

| 1:22:26| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4946)|

| 1:22:28| Commissioner Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I just want to ask Mr. Kaiser to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| If anybody is paying attention, they get a sense we're just repealing our parental leave policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| and if you want to explain why we're doing that and we're not actually affecting anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| When Section 2-480, which is proposed to be repealed, was first enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| it afforded this leave right only to female employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| Then in 2005, the Tennessee Legislature amended the Tennessee Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| which is also applicable to governmental entities, so it applied to the city of Knoxville as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| but it afforded this leave right to male employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| So Section 2-480, which we're proposing to repeal, is outdated and doesn't match current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| Moreover, there's a state statute that controls cities and other governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| So in that sense, it's really redundant in view of the fact that the state law does control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| So the proposal is to repeal, for those reasons, Section 2-480| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| and address it in the administrative rules for purposes of employee reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5012)|

| 1:24:29| 12M is an ordinance to amend Chapter 2, Article 7, Division 3 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| entitled Relocation Policy, by repealing Sections 2-741 through 2-745| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5073)|

| 1:24:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Let me ask you with regards to this, and I may have overlooked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| It doesn't seem to say anywhere ultimately that when this is developed by the Department of Finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| and Accountability, this policy that it's going to come back to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| It seems to me that maybe that should, because this is more of a kind of legislative function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Do we anticipate this coming back to Council or this policy being implemented by the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| of Finance and Accountability and not coming back to us at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| No, Vice Mayor Brown, it will come back to Council for approval once we develop the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| It just didn't say that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Good clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5131)|

| 1:25:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| 12N is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923 of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| an act to incorporate the City of Knoxville in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| and define the rights, powers, and liabilities of the same to fix the boundaries of said municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| and to repeal all acts or parts of acts in conflict with this act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| and all acts are mandatory thereto by amending Section 703 of said Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| in order to provide that non-resident property owners shall cast ballots in any city election only by mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| in a manner to be prescribed by the State Coordinator of Elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| and further providing for the submission of this ordinance to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| for approval as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| requested by Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Mr. Mayor, we also have our Administrator of Elections here, and if you'd like to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| I'd like to give him that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Greg, if you want to kind of clarify what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| My name is Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| I'm the Administrator of Elections in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| I live at 504 Bosworth Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I want to thank Vice Mayor Brown and the Mayor and Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Swanson for all their help in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| What we're trying to do, I'm sure you're familiar with the idea of property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| It's people, residents of the State of Tennessee who own property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| By state law and our charter, they're allowed to vote in city elections just for city questions and city offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5221)|
| 1:27:09| What they do in Cleveland and what I'd like to see us do here is they conduct those elections just by paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5229)|
| 1:27:18| In other words, they mail it to the city property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| We mail a ballot to the property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| The reason we want to do this now is now it's kind of a problem for the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Number one, take, for example, an August election when there's a city question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| They vote, say, in Powell where they live for governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Then they've got to drive down to the 21st Ward or wherever they own the property in the city and vote there just on the city questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5255)|
| 1:27:44| So it's an inconvenience for the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| And it's a little difficult to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| What we end up doing is training 450 election workers what to do when 200 people show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| And we've got the best election workers in the world, but I'd like to just take one more thing away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| As it is now, they have to worry about fail-safe voters, change of address procedures, change of name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| what to do if a voter shows up at the wrong precinct, how to open up the new machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| And I would like to just, you know, when I'm in a training class and, oh, by the way, don't forget about the property qualified voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| because it's a completely different procedure when they walk in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| So what we'd like to do is take that out of the hands of the election workers and let us do like they do in Cleveland, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| and just mail these people their property qualified ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| It would be so much easier for them as a voter and it would be easier for us as administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Greg, for those property qualified voters, how will they know that this is how they vote going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Well, we could send them a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| It can or will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| We'll send them a letter notifying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| They'll receive a ballot in the mail, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| They will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| But that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| We'll send them a letter if this passes in August informing them that henceforth they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| We're not talking about a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| There's currently 270.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| And we do, before every city election, we go back through these and look these up to make sure they still own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| It's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| I think it would be better for the voter and it would be better for us, too, as an election office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| So I'd like to get you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| And ultimately it's the voters that decide anyway because it is a change to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| So I'd ask for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Well, my question is along the lines of your question and to voice a major concern because you're saying, oh, it's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| It's only 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| I think that's a shame that it's only 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| There are many people who should be taking advantage of this opportunity because they are the taxpayers of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| and some of them pay substantial amounts in tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| And what concerns me is I do not believe that all of those property owners are aware that they have the privilege of voting in city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5385)|
| 1:29:55| So that really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I don't know how we handle that, but I think that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| I'm constantly having people make comments to me that they wish they could vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| And I'll say, well, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| You are a city property owner and you can vote in the city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| Well, they've never been told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| They have no idea they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| And I just think the relationships with those individuals would be much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| It would be certainly their privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| It's their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| But it concerns me that evidently we don't have any process for educating them in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| I don't know if that information can go out with their tax bills or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5434)|
| 1:30:42| but I think there needs to be a concerted effort to find a way to inform them of how they register, that they can vote, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5442)|
| 1:30:52| So it's kind of like that resolution we had with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| You know, this is just a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| but I really hope it will be taken to heart by the Election Commission and by your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| because I constantly am having those conversations with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| and encouraging them to come down to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Well, you know, making it easier like this may get more participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Councilman Hallquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Mr. McKay, you said something about this passing in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| August of which year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| It would be August election in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| That implied August of this year, and it has to be in the state election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| There's no election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| In terms of the availability of the lists of the people, the addresses, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| of property qualified voters to say candidates who are running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| are you going to make that available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| So it's distinct, it's clear that these are property qualified voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| as opposed to just being blended in with other voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| I guess it would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| You know, when you supply voter databases to candidates that buy those databases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| for instance, I think they would want to be able to address these people differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| because, you know, you're not knocking on their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| They want to be able to say, oh, yeah, those are property qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| and they'd want to be able to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| So I would think that that would be a consideration, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Just like anything we have at our office, it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| It's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| I'm not sure if anybody's ever asked specifically for just those, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| But now that they're voting differently, more may vote, like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| It may become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5561)|

| 1:33:01| and make it easier for folks to vote, we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5581)|

| 1:33:08| and the new voting machines are working out well and commend him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5588)|

| 1:33:46| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Before I get into this, I think I need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| and let council know per instructions from my attorney that this actually affects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5633)|
| 1:34:03| Well, you'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| And so I must disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Is that right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I don't think this is the one that affects you yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| I think this is the one that creates the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| but then there's going to be a particular piece of property later on that might affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5659)|

| 1:34:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| I just didn't want to miss my opportunity again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| It's sort of the part of our neighborhood initiative that MPC has been pushing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| sort of getting a better base zone for some of our larger lot neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| I got a chance to attend one of Mr. Donaldson's presentations about this a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| And I understand and I should have thought of asking you this beforehand, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| so I apologize on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| But I know you're doing a few more presentation at neighborhood meetings where you're going to be going over this with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| And I wonder if you could just announce that so that folks that are interested in what's going on know there's a place to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| to get a good education on it, which you do well if you're able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| Yeah, we'll be taking this show on the road in the next couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Next Monday, the 14th, we'll be at Fountain City Town Hall at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| One of the neighborhoods in their area has requested more information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| And the following Monday, the 21st, we'll be at the West Hills neighborhood meeting making a presentation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5726)|
| 1:35:36| So we'll have those two lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| And if other neighborhoods are interested, they call you to set something up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| 215-2500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| I just want to comment that I really appreciate Town Hall East really digging their feet in and making this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| This is something that many neighborhoods have talked about for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And we've had issues here repeatedly that I believe would have been best served to have been worked through in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| So I just congratulate you all for hanging in there with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| You've been working on this a long time, and I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| And you've had wonderful leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| And Mr. Donaldson has certainly been very, very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| And I just appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| And I appreciate you going out to other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Because other neighborhoods contacted me and said, oh, gee, why just these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| Why not us too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| I think you'll have a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And I appreciate you all being the guiding light, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5800)|

| 1:37:01| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| This is Old Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| We've all been through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I think personally we're making mistakes with what we're doing with Old Callahan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| putting too much development on it when Callahan is there as a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| So I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=5833)|

| 1:40:05| How is your operation going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Because it's currently a four-by-four off-road center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| My name is Richard Allen Merritt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I reside at 4404 Dogwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| What that is, I'm the current owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| We have closed that business and leased the building out to a person that's going to do wholesale lubrication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6024)|
| 1:40:33| Are you talking, you know, quarts of oil and not 50-gallon drums of gasoline, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| To my knowledge, sir, there will be no gasoline kept on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| but there may be larger quantities of petroleum products like oil, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6044)|
| 1:40:52| Talking with the person that's leasing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| he proposed maybe that there would be up to 200 or 300 gallons of petroleum product at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6056)|
| 1:41:06| But that's not within any, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| the housing that's located in that area is probably 50 to 100 yards east of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6070)|
| 1:41:20| Chief Kee, is some operation like that okay with the fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6080)|
| 1:41:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6089)|

| 1:44:25| Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor Brown, councilmen, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| I'm Sharon Davis, 401-4 Holston Hills Road in the Super 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| I'm president of the Neighborhood Association, Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| And Town Hall East was formed in the 60s as a platform for the neighborhood to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| to unite, to promote and protect our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| And 47 years later, our neighborhood is still going strong under Town Hall East Community Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6298)|
| 1:45:06| I'd like to ask this board, how many of you live in a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| Your subdivision probably has regulations and restrictions, building codes that protects your property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6312)|
| 1:45:20| Holston Hills is an older, beautiful neighborhood that doesn't have the benefit of these restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| We have large lots, many trees, and we have a low-density neighborhood that we would like to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6327)|
| 1:45:38| The R1EN zoning helps with that protection of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| We have actually tried several different methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| We looked at city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| We looked at historic overlay, NC1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| And we actually considered putting restrictions in each deed, deed by deed, one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| But that really didn't satisfy the desire of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| This R1EN zoning does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| And we would appreciate your support of this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Shirley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Shirley Nash-Pitts, 5205 East Sunset Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| I concur with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| I have a terrible cold, so forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| Everything that Sharon said, as most of you know, I've lived in Holston Hills practically all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| And I have a little lot, you know, behind my house that I could probably put two little houses back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| I don't think my neighbors would be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| So I think this is what will protect us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| And not only just our neighborhood but a lot of the other neighborhoods in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| because we've heard from West Hills and several other neighborhoods that want this same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| And I really want to commend Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| I mean, he's done a wonderful job on working with this, coming up with this idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| and then going out into the community and explaining it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| So, Mark, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| We really appreciate you, who, by the way, happens to live in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| So we would appreciate you supporting us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| I'm going to go with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| I think I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| I just wanted to point out one big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Part of Holston Hills lies in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| And it only references the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| The police chief is a resident of the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Send it back to MPC because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| Mr. Donaldson, would you explain process-wise how this works when we pass the new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6461)|
| 1:47:52| the R1EN zoning on first reading and by ordinance, which means it's not in effect yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6472)|
| 1:48:01| and this comes before us on first reading as a rezoning under that ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Would you explain the nature of that process and how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| Well, this is the first of two required readings at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| The second reading will be two weeks from this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| And then the effective date of the ordinance will be 17 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| So there will be a period of two, four-plus weeks before the actual requirements of the new district will become effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6505)|
| 1:48:36| This is just sort of a fast-track approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| In other words, assuming that the new zoning ordinance passes and becomes effective, then this would become effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6519)|
| 1:48:47| But the idea here is to get one of these established as quickly as possible, in this case Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| Holston Hills is merely first in line, probably due to my residence there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| and being a card-carrying member of Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| But the idea is just to sort of fast-track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| That's the reason it's before us tonight rather than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Concurrent with the creation of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Yeah, rather than waiting, making it consecutive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| We have had one replat of a lot already as a result of the information going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6556)|
| 1:49:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| I think some council members may have already seen a letter from an attorney saying that there's an RP-1 parcel that they want excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6566)|
| 1:49:38| So I'm sure we'll be hearing more from them in the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| I just want to clarify what Mr. Donaldson said about partly this is moving quickly because you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| And just to emphasize, the neighborhood has been talking about this when you were still living in a different state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| So you might feel good about it, but some of the work that's been going on there really is the reason why this is up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| And while I'm sure the neighborhood and all of us appreciate you, work goes on long before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| Just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| What I wanted to point out also was that this has been worked on for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| I've been in some of those Town Hall East meetings where we talked about going out and surveying all the individual properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| and the overlay, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| It's been a labor of love to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Also, it not only covers Holston Hills, but Chehowee Hills, the Holston Heights area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| So it covers a good broad area there of folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| And Town Hall East is comprised of folk who live in all those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| not just Holston Hills but all those connected areas that are affected here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| So this is something that all the community out in that area that's affected by this have had input here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| And I'm very excited about this happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| And we did get the one letter about the one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| But I think this is for the betterment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| Another thing what I wanted to say is now is the time where I need to say for the record that this affects the home I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| And now that I've said that on the record, I can vote for it and want to make sure that it's properly disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6672)|

| 1:51:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| 12 BB is an ordinance approving the request of DART Livingston for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6676)|

| 1:51:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Counselor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| There was, Mr. Alquist, I know there were some questions around this and the TDOT and realigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| why we postponed it way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| Have those all been worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Well, I'm not certain they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| And I intend to take a closer look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| I'm still concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| I don't know that it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| But I think it's probably not appropriate to hold it up on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| If you remember, this is the one we just postponed to sort of a date uncertain out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Because we weren't certain about some of the TDOT stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| So, as I remember, we almost just picked that May 8th date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| So that's how that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| And where we go from here, I think, is still a little unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070508?start=6733)|
