| 0:08:46| and clarifying some issues that come up from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And the third thing is that we, from time to time, have land-use applicants who wish to postpone their item that's on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=530)|
| 0:09:00| and I would really like to have either the applicant or a representative for them come to council in case we have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=540)|
| 0:09:10| when we're getting ready to postpone this because sometimes there's a little confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| and I personally would be much more comfortable if someone was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I just wanted to announce that this month is November's Epilepsy Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| and there's two gentlemen here, Bill Brown, who's the president of the board, and the former president, Roy Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| And this is an organization located at 1715 Magnolia doing great work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| and they just wanted to speak briefly about what's going on this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Madam Mayor, council members, thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| November is Epilepsy Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| The Center for Disease Control estimates there are about 43,000 people in East Tennessee that suffer from epilepsy or seizure disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| We estimate there's about 15,000 epileptics or people who suffer from seizure disorders in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| Epilepsy is the fourth leading neurological disorder in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Migraine, stroke, Alzheimer's, and then epilepsy, it's a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| The people suffer from disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| They can't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| They have seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Maybe many of you have seen people who have relatives who have seizures, so I'm sure you're aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| The Epilepsy Foundation of East Tennessee is on East Magnolia Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| It services the community, provides support services for the epileptics in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| It provides helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| One of its big operations is to provide bicycle helmets for children to prevent head injuries, which is a leading cause of epilepsy seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=647)|
| 0:10:58| The staff goes around to the events, the schools, and hands out free helmets to the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| That's a big activity, prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| It's a United Way agency, and it has served the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| How long, Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| I think we've been 36 years in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| We think we've served a lot of great citizens, and we think we play a very vital role in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| And so we thank the council, the mayor and the council, for this moment to address the issue of epilepsy in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| and thank Councilman Stair for giving us a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| Any questions about epilepsy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| If anyone has someone who is interested in education about what to do, first aid for seizures, that's one of the major activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| to go around the city, different organizations, businesses, community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and educate people and schools, teachers, nurses, on what to do in the event of a seizure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| So if anyone would like anything, service, educational activity from the foundation, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you very much, both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=727)|

| 0:12:35| Thank you very much for being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| 8B is a resolution confirming the reappointment of Sam Adams, Brian Campbell, and Beth McDonald to the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Are any of them here tonight and recognize their service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| All right, I know we've got some people signed up here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| Well, I'd like to start out with Bob or Don Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| I don't know who is going to talk about perhaps what the plan is and what's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| so we can kind of enlighten some folks in our TV audience and those here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| What's before you tonight is a request to amend the South Waterfront budget for $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| This would be to do public improvements adjacent to the Rivers Edge property development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| The funding to support these expenses will come from the new tax increment that's generated from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| This project is estimated to generate $150,000 to $200,000 a year in new increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| so it will go to support this over the life of the TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| This process has been going on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Just to give a little background, the first meeting was back, golly, spring of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| We started working with the developer at that time to bring him into compliance with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| Form-based code is the regulating plan that superseded or came after the vision plan was first developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| There have been a lot of iterations to get to the document that you see in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| which is a site plan which is fully compliant with the form-based codes it was driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| And our concept is if we have developers that move alongside us to make development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| then we move alongside them to do the public improvements that enhance the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| And that's how we've gotten here tonight, if that helps answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah, it does, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| We probably, if we could just have the folks that wanted to speak to it, we could go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| According to this list here, we have five people assigned to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| The three who are assigned to speak for the ordinance, the amendment, are Pat Harmon, Patty Barrier, and Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=899)|
| 0:15:09| And we'll go in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| And then Mike Roddicker and Chris Field are here to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So, Pat, if you would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| And by council rules, I'm going to set my timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| And we ask that you first give your name and your address, and we appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| My name is Pat Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| I live at 3501 June Street within the South Haven Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| I am an officer in the association, the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Our board has already given our approval and sent e-mails to the city council that we do approve this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=938)|
| 0:15:48| It's at the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| It's within our boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Now, the subject at hand now is whether or not we get street improvements and the Riverwalk to go with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| In our opinion, it is self-defeating for South Knoxville to oppose the infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| That's what will benefit the surrounding area the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| The whole premise of South Waterfront development is that when a private developer has a project that meets the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| the city will step in and make the necessary infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| If the city reneges on that for the very first development, why in the heck would any other development want to come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| Please know that South Haven Neighborhood Association wants the infrastructure improvements funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Ms. Barrier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Patty Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| I am in support of the infrastructure to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| I sent an e-mail to all council pertaining to the SW2 and the Gumpert Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| I think we need to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| He has worked with the neighborhoods over quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| and he has been very open to what the neighborhoods have suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| Hopefully, with the road work and other things to come in the future with this plan, we're all looking forward to it anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1051)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Mr. Stanley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| John Gumpert has worked with South Haven, Old Severe, and Allen Home and met with us more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| More importantly, he's listened to our concerns and tried to incorporate them in his new plans, final plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| When his final rendition is not perfect, it meets form-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| For those of us who participated in the original vision for the South Waterfront, this development fits in perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1098)|
| 0:18:28| We understand from the beginning that density was necessary for service areas and restaurants to move into the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| and the process of having new residents in South Knoxville will greatly immense these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| In fact, Old Severe will be more affected than any of the other neighborhoods by the additional traffic that will be increased on Severe Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1125)|
| 0:18:56| However, those of us that live in the Old Severe community are excited to see the beginning of waterfront activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| and welcoming new arrivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| The city has agreed from the beginning that they would provide funding for needed infrastructure related to the waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| This, in part, provides incentive for the developers to buy into the whole waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| I don't think it would be wise to use this promise as a leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| The infrastructure plan is needed in South Knoxville, and it's definitely a positive move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| We want to send a message to future developers that South Knoxville is willing to work with them in a positive manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1173)|
| 0:19:42| and to bring good development onto the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| And now Mr. Roddicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Name and address, please, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| My name is Mike Roddicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| I live at 2140 Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| I've got a handout that I'd like to pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| I don't know that there's enough for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| There's certainly enough for the council members and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| So if you need to report, this is really the front sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1216)|
| 0:20:34| You better use your time wisely while it's being passed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I'm here to express my concerns about the proposed development outside the gates of Island Home Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| I and many of my neighbors feel this proposal does not adhere to the basic concepts of the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| and therefore we are asking you to vote no on this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| One of the basic concepts of the vision plan is that this tract of land will bridge the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| between the existing single-family neighborhood of Island Home Park and the waterfront denser's core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| If you take a look at the vision plan's main illustration that you have before you, or you will shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| you will see that it offers one way to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| By taking the eastern portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| and building smaller-scale structures that mimic the existing single-family homes across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| at least in terms of size, this development can blend into the existing neighborhood more gently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| This was not a small detail in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| In fact, it is listed as a key improvement to the first draft of the vision plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| It was a concern at the time, and in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| it was obviously an issue of great importance to our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| will be viewed by us as a breach of trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| and more importantly, will set a precedent for the rest of the waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| The developer and the administration are urging approval of this budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| based on a portion of one sentence of the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| which says that multifamily development would be an appropriate use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| We are not arguing against multifamily use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| but the vision plan says more than just that one sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| and there is nothing in direct conflict between smaller-scale development and multifamily use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| Furthermore, the redevelopment plan makes it clear that use is to be flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| but that form and architecture called for in the vision plan would hold more weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| The fact that form-based codes were chosen to help realize the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| also points to the fact that form was paramount and use was secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| The concern about scale and density has been one of the fundamental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| since Mr. Gunford brought forward this latest proposal early this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Now, some of you may be under the impression that the density of this project has been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| This is simply not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| What was being touted as a reduction in density was, in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| a simple delay in development of the southern portion of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| The northern portion has seen no reduction in scale or density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| and the city has stated that the southern portion of this land can be developed at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Mr. Gunford has indicated that he has thought about what he might develop there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and the fact is that no matter what Mr. Gunford's intentions are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| he or a new owner has the right to develop this land to a density similar to what was proposed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| So that is the fundamental problem with this development in comparison with the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| It's the same one we had a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| and from what I can tell nothing significant has changed in terms of scale or density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| We have been hearing that the administration is under pressure to jumpstart the waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| While we're all eager to get started on the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| our neighborhood is not willing to bear the burden of initial poor development to provide that jumpstart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| especially now that it has become clear that there are other large-scale projects coming online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| that seem to adhere to the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Over the last couple of days I have emailed back and forth with Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| about the legal requirements in the redevelopment plan to adhere to the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| when considering public funding for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Sorry, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| My understanding of his interpretation is that you as council members are required to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| basic concepts of the vision plan and required to feel that in your mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| they are being met before approving public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| I have included these emails in my handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I believe this puts you in an unenviable position since none of you are in office for the visioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| So while I'm asking you to vote no on approving this budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I would also suggest that if you don't feel you have an adequate grasp of the vision plan at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| you delay this vote and ask for the city to provide a workshop to review the vision plan in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| so that you might make up your own mind as to what the basic concepts of the plan are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Let me reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| A yes vote on this budget amendment, according to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| is a vote stating that you believe this development adheres to the basic concepts of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| The only other thing I would like to mention is that there's supposed to be an appeals process for us to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1494)|
| 0:25:03| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Can you wrap it up in like ten seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| We just want to make sure that we still have the ability to appeal that this conforms to the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| because we were not given anything to actually look at the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and the elevations in terms of the facade materials until very, very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| So I'd like to be assured tonight that we still have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| And now Chris Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I'm first going to read a statement from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Chris Field, 2-1-2-1, Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| I want to first read a statement from our Board of Governors at Island Home Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| The Island Home Park Board of Governors would like to ask that City Council vote no on the budget amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| relating to infrastructure improvements surrounding the proposed Rivers Edge development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| We do not feel that this development is in keeping with the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| and scale of the single-family neighborhood as it is called for in the vision plan for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1566)|
| 0:26:16| We look forward to continuing to work with the City of Knoxville, the property developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and surrounding neighborhoods to assure the best possible outcome for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And to take a moment to make a couple comments on behalf of myself as a resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| I'd say that I share Mr. Rodocker's concerns that this development does not comply with the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| and in turn it makes it public funding improper under the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| I also challenge the notion that this development complies with the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| namely that it complies with the requirement for single-site development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| and that it complies with the maximum block size requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So I'd like you to take those in consideration tonight as you consider this vote for public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| That concludes those who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Yeah, I'll speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I mean, obviously this is a tough one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| I mean, I've got groups here, three separate groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Two have one idea, another group has an opposing idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| But I'm going to summarize, you know, a lot of the things that have already been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and, you know, why I support, you know, us moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| But there was --let me go back to the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| And I wasn't on council then, but I did attend maybe a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| And I know it was like a two- or three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| And there was a lot of folks from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| There were professional people, people from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| And it was vetted thoroughly, open, transparent, and it was a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| Tonight, I mean, I just want people to realize we're not talking about zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| We're talking about, you know, public investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and what we said that we would do once private dollars came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| And, you know, this is what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| It's a $2.5 million improvement in my district that was unanimously approved on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1690)|
| 0:28:19| The description of what the public investment is has been given to us a couple of different times through the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| and then here tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I think it's important to know, you know, he could have started this a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| He could have started it two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I mean, he's in complete compliance with the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| So, you know, he has the legal right to begin at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Mr. Gunford has done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| I think most members of council were at that meeting at the elementary school, and it wasn't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| I mean, you could tell that folks were not happy with what was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And, you know, I do disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I think he's come back with a much different plan than what was shown that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| He's worked well with all of the not only myself and the administration, Mr. Wetzel and Don Michelle, but council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| I mean, he's done what this council has not mandated but certainly requested that developers do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| and he's been open and transparent, and I think that he's met the needs of the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| And he, you know, totally revamped, I think, to what he originally has shown us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| So, I mean, this project will generate, you know, $160,000 to $200,000 incremental tax dollars, as Mr. Wetzel referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| And, you know, I think it's important for everybody to know that 100% of all the incremental tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| that are generated on the South Waterfront development now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and moving forward will go to repay the public portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| So this is a great investment in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Like Mr. Stanley said, we need to jump start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| We need to get started on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| We've waited a long time, and I think that this is a plan that will be good for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| and for South Knoxville particularly because, as Mr. Wetzel liked to say, retail follows rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| and this is going to help stimulate an area that is in need of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| So I'm going to make a motion that we, you know, to approve on final reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1823)|
| 0:30:32| Councilman Dalibofi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Well, I'm sure, like everyone else, I've gotten a number of e-mails and contacts about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| The part that troubles me the most, actually, and we have a drawing that was handed out by Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| I don't know if the people in the audience have it or have seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| but it looks like the building designated as Building E is the one closest in this sketch to the existing single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| Is that on John Severe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| I mean, that's on Severe Boulevard or Severe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| That's on Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Island Home, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Well, it strikes me that that particular building is the one that creates, in my mind, the visual concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| I mean, we've got a neighborhood out there that's one of the great neighborhoods in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| and it's got a gorgeous boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| It's got unique homes that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And any time you go there, I think that neighborhood puts a smile on your face with both the diversity of the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| the nice green setting, the riverfront park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| And I'm just curious, is there any way to flip that Building E so it faces that horseshoe road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| or some way to change that configuration so that the transition is more gradual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Because it strikes me that that's sort of the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| I mean, maybe folks out there wouldn't want to see any of this happen, but that's not in their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| But it seems to me that that 27-unit, three-story building, or is that two-story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| I can't hardly read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Three-story building right there just slams you into the transition from single-family to multiple-family in a large height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1927)|
| 0:32:19| And it would be nice if that could be flipped closer to that horseshoe road or some series of smaller buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| Now, I realize you don't have control of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| You have control, and what's in front of us are the public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| I think everyone here wants to see, you know, the Riverwalk go forward and the road work improvements happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| But it sure would be nice, and I don't know if there's anyone here from the developer that can talk about some form of transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1956)|
| 0:32:46| housing-style building, whatever, that kind of lets you ramp slowly up into the bigger buildings, because I think that's the sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. Devlin, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| We all believe Island Home is a great neighborhood, and we've worked long and hard on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| Let me do a couple of things here, and then I'm going to flip to Don and Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| We are bound as city staff by the regulating plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| And we've had an administrative review committee look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| And the reason these buildings are at the street, and I may be stealing some of Don and Michelle's thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| You've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| I have, but we'll let her talk about how it got here and what the regulating plan says at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| Don and Michelle Foster, Deputy Director of Redevelopment and Acting South Waterfront Farm-Based Code Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| The reason we have an administrative review committee that consists of city staff and also KUB, the farm marshal, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| So we went through many iterations of reviewing this development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| The building E was one of those buildings that we had to have several reviews on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| because it has to meet several percentage of frontage, and that's why it's facing that way as you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| Also, based on the farm-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| You can't flip the parking lots closer to that and have trees and some transition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| I think it's been approved by the administrative review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| and I think that satisfies the farm-based code compliance as far as the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| and the percentage of the surface parking required as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Also, the regulating plan identifies certain public improvements for that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| If there was a development there, you would have a realignment of Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| I think you all have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| It also incorporates street improvements that includes the sidewalk, bike lanes, on-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| all that in order to provide that movement of Island Home Avenue to the south to allow for a public river walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| So it doesn't matter if this development or any other development occurred in that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| you would have to realign Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| But I wasn't talking about the roadway so much as the mass of the structure that seems to inflict somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| with the kind of single-family neighborhood that's slightly to its east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Even though you have a certain type of development that's encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| there are townhouses, duplexes, multi-residential is what this developer sought after to develop in that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| So that's why you had that particular type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| If I had sent you some information late this afternoon on kind of a summary of the different e-mails that we've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| could you address some of those points for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Well, in particular, I think one to address in particular was the role of the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and the redevelopment plan and use of public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I think I might call on my law director to answer that question in his specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| We have reviewed the vision plan, the regulating plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| and the redevelopment plan in making decisions as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Let me remind everybody this is the first project that's come forward under the South Waterfront form-based code process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| And so I think we're all learning things on that process as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| We certainly feel like that all the proper steps have been taken here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| I'd like to hear Charles make a couple of comments on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I would just say that as you look at these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| and I've read these plans over the past week or so with a pretty close eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| and what stands out to you in terms of reviewing the vision plan and the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| it is very clear that after reading those, the vision plan is contemplated as a basic framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| a set of general guidelines to use to inform the later specific redevelopment that is to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| And there's just so much language in the vision plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| Governor Haslam's introduction, and then Mayor Bill Haslam's introduction to the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| refers to it as a 20-year strategy for revitalization and says very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| not everything will be built exactly as shown in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| That tells you that it's not to be you don't adhere specifically to each little item of that plan the way it's set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| It's just a basic framework, and it refers to itself as a basic framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| In the executive summary, it says this plan is not intended to be rigid and inflexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| And in the redevelopment plan itself, the vision plan is referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| and it's referred to as a guiding document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| It's not referred to as something you have to strictly adhere to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and that is not mandated either in the vision plan or in the redevelopment plan that whatever ends up being reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:52| and economically feasible is what really dictates what's going to go into this actual redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| But the general guidelines for that are set out in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| So it's my view that you can read the vision plan, you can look at the vision plan yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2283)|
| 0:38:12| and you can decide whether what is being proposed is consistent with that vision plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| It's an issue upon which I would assume that reasonable minds could differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| But certainly I don't view what I have seen in the vision plan and what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| I don't see any legal impediment at all to you concluding that what is proposed is consistent with the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2308)|
| 0:38:37| particularly in light of the fact that the vision plan, on its face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| does not expect strict adherence to each little item that's in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| It's just a general framework for how this construction or this redevelopment is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| Does that answer your question, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I think one other thing on the vision plan that just occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| in the last couple of weeks we've adopted the form-based code for Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and I was a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| I wasn't here while the south waterfront plan was being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| But if you'll look at the vision plan from Cumberland for 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| and what got adopted in the code in 2012, there's some significant differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| and that's happened because we've talked with people and worked with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| and you've got the same sort of thing happen as you move from the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| to the regulating plan for the south waterfront as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Vision plans guide you, and they set you in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| This vision plan says it would be an appropriate site for multifamily or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| but it said multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| The regulating plan allowed multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| and this developer who owns the land came forward with a multi-plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| that Dawn and her administrative review committee have taken fully through the compliance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| and have made it compliant with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| So what the administration is then saying is that it is consistent with the south waterfront vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| And is it consistent with the form-based code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| That would be our interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Let me tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| It's always that, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| I think Councilman Della Vopi brought up a good point about it seems like that part of the problem has to do with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| from what I understand in hearing on some of the e-mails today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| that the transition between island home and this project seems inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| with what was at least shown on the vision plan in terms of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| In other words, it seems like one of the things that I've heard is the concern of the three-story building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| right next to island home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| There's no transition between the R1 neighborhood and this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| I think that's one of the concerns, and I don't know to what extent any design can still be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| The other question comes up is that what is going to happen to the property south of the railroad track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| It's also a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| I think we can let the developer answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I'll give you a couple of quick answers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| There will be problems developing that back track for three reasons, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Access to the site, one, through Hillwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| There's not a good access at that site from Hillwood as it now lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| There's not an access over the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| As we talked on the Cumberland thing we'll talk about later tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| those things can be expensive and dangerous to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And there's a hillside slope ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| So you have to overcome all those three things to really develop the backside of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| And the access and the slope and hillside ordinance is what really took it off the plate this time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| It couldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Well, I think the other thing that concerns me is the fact that, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| I appreciate what Councilman Pavlis has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| is that we've got three major neighborhoods that are going to be affected by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| And we have one neighborhood that still has some questions about, you know, what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| And the neighborhood that has the most questions is the neighborhood that is adjacent to the complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| And so I don't know how that's going to work out in terms of the concern that they really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| in terms of the transition between the R1 and that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I understand that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And some of it's a timing issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I would remind you that, you know, several months ago, months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| we said, first thing you need to do, if we're going to support public funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| you need to get yourself in compliance with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Second thing you need to do is you need to get out and talk to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| And if you do both of those things and things go well, then we can be supportive of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And he came back, he got in compliance with form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| and he immediately went and talked to all three neighborhoods several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| And at those meetings was not given any indication that there was any real problem with what he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| And that's why some of this has caught us by surprise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| I understand where you're coming from, but that's caught us by surprise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| But he's been out talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Well, it is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| It's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And I wasn't on council when this was started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| So I printed off 100 pages of the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| and that seemed to be the overriding factor of the e-mails and the complaints I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| And so I took this vision plan, I read through it, and I've looked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| and I've asked the people that have called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| what is so offensive about why you're so offended and what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| And we come back to, well, it doesn't meet the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| I was like, there is so much ambiguity in this vision plan, it could go all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| I could take points out of here and argue for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| But we're not asking to be disowning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| A lot has changed since 2006 in the real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| It's not the same market that this was written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| And it didn't anticipate the dip in the real estate recession that we've run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| And so, I mean, do you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| If you don't think this is a good development, do you sit and wait on the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And when is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Is it going to be a year from now, six months from now, or is it ever going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Is it the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Is it the best we can do for the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| And does it generally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I think it generally makes a vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| This one piece that they show, this drawing, is just a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| That's one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| But there's a lot of language in there that's all over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| They want to embrace the people of South Knoxville, yet we want to increase the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| Well, we want to increase it in certain places and not others, but it's not that specific, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Or I didn't read it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| And I think that today's development is not about single family and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| It's about multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| And this is where the lenders want to lend, and it's what people want right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| With the number of foreclosures that we've had, historic highs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| and the number of bankruptcies we've had, we've affected people's borrowing power to buy houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And so we've taken away a lot of the buying public and the buying market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| And so we're in a rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| And that's why we're seeing it all over, from North Shore Town Center all the way to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| that people are looking for rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| The rental market is strong, and this is where the developer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| And so I guess I'm in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| I think the details we've gotten over the last couple of weeks have impressed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| that he's putting enough detail in it and enough architectural detail that makes it appealing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| And based on what I've seen, I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Some of the earlier renderings were not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, from the time we left South Elementary School, South Knox Elementary School a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| and the volatility that was in that meeting to today, people calling and writing in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| I feel like we've come a long way based on that, based on the people that I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| So I think it's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| I think it's the right move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Let's jumpstart this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I think you've got a big future ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| We've got to get started, and this seems to be the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Councilman Wallace, you stole most of my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| But I've been very aware for a while, and it's difficult, I think, for the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| to accept that multifamily dwellings are where the lending power, borrowing power is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| It is also where the greatest need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| And that doesn't always fit with the vision that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| This developer came a year ago and did not get a warm Tennessee welcome by a long shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| And he's come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| He's made changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I admire the fact that he stuck with it because most developers, we've seen them come through town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| would have walked away after that meeting a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| But he's made the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| He's met with the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| He has met the form-based requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Visions are visions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| And at the time they're written, they're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| And six months later, usually there are some clouds and sunshine that change that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| So, first of all, I want to second your motion, Vice Mayor Pavlis, and I will be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I have to say, I mean, this, you know, it affects equally in my mind three neighborhoods here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| Allen Holm, Oseveer, and South Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| It actually sits in the South Haven footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| And that weighs pretty heavy on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I mean, it's their turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| But regardless of that, I don't want to get it as an us versus them thing because it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| Both groups are looking out for what they feel like from their boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| And let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| I've had people within Allen Holm, friends there, that are totally in support of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| And I've had people that are against it that are in some of the other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| So, I mean, these folks are up here, for the most part, speaking for their boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| but I don't know of anybody that's taken a vote from the whole community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| So there's good and bad in it, but I think, you know, obviously to me what I've heard here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| and all the answers, it's been thorough, it's been vetted, and I think it's time for us to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Early on, like Vice Mayor Pavlis, I went to several of the meetings, the visioning plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| and thought at the time that this was a very comprehensive approach to looking at the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| South Waterfront Development District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| And to me, this does mirror, not precisely, as I think we will all admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| but the thought of or the vision of development along that waterfront I think is mirrored in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| While there are some particulars I'm a little troubled by, by and large, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| And, of course, what we're being asked is the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| And I want to, I'm like Vice Mayor Pavlis, I want to move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| We've talked about this for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| We had a chance two weeks ago to vet it, and it passed, as you indicated, 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| I'm ready to vote and move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Councilman Della Voti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Let me just clear up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| I am not here to debate whether someone has touched the base on the vision plan exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| or whether the vision plan is set in concrete and not flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| I'm simply saying that first parcel that has Building E strikes me as the location where some alternate array of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=2994)|
| 0:50:04| buildings, maybe smaller chunks, maybe reorienting it on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| would go a long way to modifying the impact on that existing historic community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| And I didn't hear a representative from the developer stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| I'm just curious if there's any other configuration that they could look at or would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| I think the point about the public infrastructure is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| I think we're here to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Is there someone here from the developer who can speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Mr. Gumpert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Because the concern was is that it's so abrupt, that transition, that you kind of hit a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| And is there any way to – and I know economics drives any development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| but is there any way to reconfigure that lot so it's less of a – just a bump to a three-story building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| I'm John Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I live at 3924 Paces Ferry in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| What we can't do is reduce the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| The 27 that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Well, just the total development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| We've taken it from some over 200 down to 134.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| And all of our financing is based on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Your pro forma kind of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| And working with lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| We're quite a ways down the road with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I was interested in your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| We actually, because of the form-based code, have pushed those buildings to the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| and that particular building was somewhat forced against that street to comply with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3095)|
| 0:51:44| And I was on the committee that did the form-based code division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| and what have you back some six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| You were at that Dogwood school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Or the South Knox school, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| So the issue is the buildings interact and really front the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| And you have to do calisthenics to get them to do that in the case of that building on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| because it's not a regular corner, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| So we had to go through some real lengths to get it to comply with the code to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| But the basic part, you know, when you talk about multifamily, today multifamily, at least in an urban setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3139)|
| 0:52:28| which I believe this is, interacts with the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| We are closer to the street than in the island home neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| It's just the new urbanism type design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| You know, an older apartment community might have a fence around it with gates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| and it's its own community, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| What we looked at, at least from my perspective on the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| was to create neighborhoods that interacted, and they interacted from the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| So that's why those buildings are so close to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| It's really to interact with the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| and that's why the public improvements are so important to the design, including the boardwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3187)|
| 0:53:16| So we could do what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| We could move the building and put parking between the building and the street, which is a typical project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| but it would go contrary to the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| You'd be out of compliance with the code at that time if that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| But are you using the code as handcuffs, or, I mean, is there physically a way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Oh, there's physically a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And still get the units you need to make it cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| It's just you'd be out of compliance with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| It really forces you to put it the way we've got it shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| And what about that Horseshoe Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Couldn't you face that, for example, the one that's slightly to the west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| I don't know if that has a name on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| It would be Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| That's a very charming name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Could you interact with that street, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| You know, you might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| You might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Councilman Dell, I'm hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Let me just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| I'm not trying to design it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| The form-based code is a very particular kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| And we've been through a lot of iterations with a lot of city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| We make some, we can break some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| And this is where it landed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| And to move it to the circular drive, it just can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| We've tried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| We've looked at options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| No harm in asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Councilman Dell, the circular drive is not considered a primary frontage road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| so that building cannot access or front that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| You wouldn't want to pour traffic on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| The actual parking lot is accessed from there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| The ordinance says that you cannot have buildings facing roads unless they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Is that the primary road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| In SW2, we go SW1 to SW8 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you, Mr. Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I don't see any more lights on, so we have a motion and a second to approve 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3303)|

| 0:55:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Vice Mayor on behalf of the City Council to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| an H-1 historic overlay designation and any necessary rezoning applications for the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| and improvements at 2110 Chapman Highway, which may further be identified as parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| 109AK14 pursuant to Article 4, Section 5.1 H-1 historic overlay district requested by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I just want to say that this has been a longstanding business in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| It has a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| That building has a lot of value to the folks that not only work there but people throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| this region that enjoyed the bakery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| The building is still of very good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| And this would apply to the façade only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| So they can, you know, be creative inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| I know there's one developer in particular that has contacted me that is interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| developing this and making it, bringing it back to its original beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| And if you go by and notice it, it still has a lot of natural beauty there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| So I think it's important that we, I think it was on the fragile 15 list this year, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| my feeble memory serves me correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| So it certainly helps Knox Heritage in their quest of preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| And I would just ask for the support of the council in preserving this building and letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| it long be a part of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I was teasing them earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I asked Council Frost if I could call Pavlis since he was a petitioner for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| And he said, no, I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| So, you know, so give us some information, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| Is the owner aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Has he consented to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| And, you know, give us some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I have not contacted the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| I don't think it's a local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| I believe it's a real estate REIT or someone out of New York that has ownership of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| And, again, that's why I put it on the facade only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| So there's still a lot of ability to do a lot of different things with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| But my main desire is for that building to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| It's been there 75 years, and it's been an intricate part of the history of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Well, I'm all for preserving historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| But to go in without the consent, without any attempt to contact the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| you have effectively affected the value of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Without his acknowledgement, you know, if you want to take it to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| let the market then define that developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| I mean, is it for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Is the building for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I haven't seen it advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| By placing an H-1 overlay without his consent, you have devalued his property without his acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| You've lessened the pool of people that would be interested in buying that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and, therefore, you have reduced the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| I think this has been done just a few times, and I'm aware of, in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| to put a historic overlay on a property without their acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| I think it has been met with great resentment and a lot of angst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| And I'm just against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| I mean, if you had the owner's approval, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| If you had somebody that wanted to buy it subject to that, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| If you buy a piece of property with historic overlay on it, you understand the requirements that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| But to put it on there and, you know, without anybody's even attempt to contact the seller or the owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| and get their, you know, permission, I think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| And I think it's an abuse of, you know, the ordinance that it was intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| So I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Well, I think that's a little strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| That building has sat there vacant and empty for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| And I'll disagree with you respectfully that it brings tremendous value to that because it will preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| There is a group already that is extremely willing to take it and preserve it and put, you know, if they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3621)|
| 1:00:32| if they purchase it, if this group locally purchases it from them, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| I mean, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| But, you know, it's set there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And the warehouse behind it is deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And I think it's important that we --that I take this move because nothing is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| And what eventually probably would happen is that it would be leveled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| and that there would be a who knows what go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| So based on the history of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| and based on the will of a tremendous amount of people in South Knoxville, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| I respectfully, again, disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| And I think it brings a lot of great value to that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| and will eventually add to the tax rolls of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Well, that's fine if you had the permission of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| or at least tried to reach out to the owner and try to find, you know, get it under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| The zoning can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| I mean, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| But to not contact the owner and put them under that zoning without their permission or into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| I mean, it's just a you've affected their property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| And maybe it will help them sell it, but they could have gotten that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| So that didn't help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| You've got other ordinances that pertain to blighted property that you can address it with and so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| But, I mean, I think there's got to be a real attempt to work with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| I mean, that's what we've done on other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| We've worked with the owner in a redevelopment district or other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| We've got a lot of methods to use to try to bring that into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| And this is a backwards way to do it, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Before we go on, I would like to ask the law director just to clarify what this resolution is as opposed to the actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| Yeah, this is a resolution that would authorize the vice mayor on behalf of this council to apply for the H-1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| Once that happened and once the vice mayor on behalf of council made that request of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| then you would go into the actual rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| And as a part of that rezoning process, one thing that would happen is that the owner would be notified, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| The owner would be directly notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| If not at all possible, then it would be published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| But there would be a notification process within the rezoning itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| And this is just a starter, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Councilman Della Vopi, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Is this just a starter process to take a look at it where there would be further evaluation, including owner participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| Yes, this is just the initiation of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| The process has got to be initiated either by the mayor or by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| It says MPC take a look at this, recommending that you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| They can give us advice that might be entirely different than the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| Certainly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| And, actually, the Historic Zoning Commission agenda is published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| So even if they can't find the property owner, whether or not they can find the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| it still becomes published in the daily paper of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| I will ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| You mentioned the warehouse behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| That's not included in this, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| As all of us, I hope, know, we do have a little bit of a spotty record in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| There was one very high-profile structure that had the overlay placed on it by a former mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| and that was problematic at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| On the other hand, there have been some other structures that city council has initiated the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| and it has gone through and worked well for the owner, for the property, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| So while it's not a perfect process, it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| And the fact that it is going to go to the Historic Zoning Commission as part of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| there will be a pretty thorough review of this before any recommendation is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3883)|

| 1:05:34| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| I didn't know if we have a couple of enthusiasts here that may want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Dr. Cooley or someone may want to speak on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Please set your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| My name is Amy Benner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| I live at 402 East Oak Hill Avenue in Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I know that several of you guys were all on the bike ride with elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| I know that this is a cause that Council fully supports in its unanimity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| And we're up against TDOT again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| They're not following some recommendations that the city has made to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| Actually, TDOT came to the city and asked for them to make recommendations on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| and the city gave them a project proposal that included bike lanes, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| and TDOT ignored that and did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| They claim today that they've spent $34,000 looking into possible pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| and bicycle facilities for this project, but I don't think they broke down how they did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| and I don't think that they asked the city to delve deeper into the recommendations that the city made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| that included a sidewalk and a bike lane on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| So I know that a lot of community members have been e-mailing TDOT directly on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| and I think that you all's support will also help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| And I think Safe Routes to School is a part of this as well, as well as we're with Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| Dr. Cooley and I are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And I know we've got several other organizations in the community that support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Okay, so we have a motion, and is that all that you want to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| and I'm a board member of Bike Walk Tennessee and also a member of Bike Walk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| and several of you have participated in our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| I wanted to just say thank you for your prompt response to our e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| and support for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And this also wanted to remind you that we do have other partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| including the Knox County Safe Routes to School Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| and also Together Healthy Knox, particularly the Policy Action Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| whose the actual policy that we are working towards is having an implementation of Complete Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| And obviously this project would be an anathema to a Complete Streets policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| And so I really appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Anathema?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| He can come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Councilman, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Councilman Campbell still has his slide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Oh, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Amy, you wanted Amy to come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| Oh, Dr. Cooley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I just, this effectively cuts off Fountain City from the rest of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| and we're really promoting bike and pedestrian-friendly travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, this is the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| If they're doing a major overhaul of the intersection, it's either down Broadway or through Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| So we've really got to come to something, and I hope TDOT listens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| Well, that was going to be my question, just to clarify that if this doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| we've really, in essence, put a dam between Fountain City and the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| And so it's my understanding they were serious about it at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| but then for some reason it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| I think Jim Hagerman can probably address it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| but TDOT says they don't have enough right-of-way, or they feel they don't have enough right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| Now, they're working with TDOT to try to figure all that out, but certainly it is a major corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| and there are no other options for several miles east or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| And that's our concern, that it's a very important part of a bicycle-pedestrian network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| that connects the neighborhoods north of 640 with the neighborhoods south of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| It's a barricade almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| It's like a river, except for it's a motor vehicular river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Council, our staff is working very closely with TDOT as well, encouraging them with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| so we welcome your resolution on this to support our efforts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4210)|

| 1:18:49| We have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4730)|

| 1:19:16| This is a marked copy here and I would invite any questions to Ms. Eschlinger and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| would like to come identify yourself and take any questions that might arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| We do recommend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| My name is Kathy Eschlinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| I'm an attorney with the law firm of Kennerly, Montgomery and Findlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We serve as counsel to the City of Knoxville Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| We have worked very closely with Mr. Cherry and now Ms. Walsh-Pekowski, sorry, needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4779)|
| 1:19:51| it right in front of me, I had it, to get the supplemental plan provisions prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4791)|
| 1:20:01| in consultation with the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| They have been approved by the pension board and are here today before City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| This seems to do quite a bit with the new plan, the Division H. Can you summarize exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4818)|
| 1:20:25| what this does with the Division H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I can certainly try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| It does several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| First, it deals with the interest crediting rate and it sets forth specifically the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| for calculating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| And what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| The way Plan H is set up, it is designed to have both employee contribution credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4847)|
| 1:20:56| and employer contribution credits and then on a quarterly basis, then those contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| will be credited with interest based on the earnings of the system fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| So that is the amount of interest that will be credited to those hypothetical account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| And what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| You sort of started off on a list and the first thing it does is it affects the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4880)|
| 1:21:30| rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| And one thing also of note on the interest crediting rate, it sets forth rules for dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| with the interest crediting rate in a participant's last year of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| That was left open in the charter to develop some special rules there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| And what it essentially does, it says in that last year, instead of the interest crediting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| rate that's based upon the actual earnings of the fund, then the hypothetical account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| will be credited instead with a 4% interest for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| Also the Plan H provisions deal with re-employment and reinstatement and it goes through all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4927)|
| 1:22:16| of the various things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| For instance, if a vested member of Division H leaves employment and then comes back as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4939)|
| 1:22:28| an employee of the city later on, they start back just where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| And I can get into the specifics of each of those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Just a list more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| That's what I was looking for unless other members would like some of the details on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| And that is pretty much Division H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| I guess I had one question about the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| It looks like there's a lot of information about how the annuities calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Would you also say that's what this does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| It also does set forth the actuarial factors that will be used in calculating the annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| and calculating the actual benefit that will be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| And those are also included in Appendix A and they've been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| The very last under N of Appendix A sets forth the Division H conversion factors and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| were the factors that were recommended by the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| With most people who hear the word annuity, at least mine, my eyes kind of glaze over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| if you were trying to describe it to an employee about this program, how would you tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| how the annuity would be calculated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| You ask very complicated questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| It takes the value that is in the hypothetical account and it determines, it looks at a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5034)|
| 1:24:03| of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| It looks at how old you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| It looks at life expectancy factors, how long somebody your age would be expected to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5046)|
| 1:24:15| It applies an interest rate to determine the present value, what that money could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5055)|
| 1:24:25| expected to earn over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| It takes all of those things into a calculation to determine what a monthly value of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| benefit would be for the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| So it's essentially converting what you see as a lump sum amount in a hypothetical account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| and then converts that amount to a monthly annuity, a monthly pension benefit for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Yes, I'm just appreciative of some of the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| I actually tried to read all the way through this and got there, but I may have injured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| myself occasionally on falling on my pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| This is very technical water that you tread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| Is it fair to say that this document tries to keep the plan in accordance with the Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| Revenue Code requirements for what a qualified plan is and that it's not trying to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| or change the plans, but simply to make it conform to the IRS rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| That is the main function of the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| That is why they were initially put into place, and that is why we have to amend and restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| them every five years and submit the plan to the Internal Revenue Service for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| of the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| In addition to the qualification requirements, the SPPs is now presented before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| The S who what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Oh, the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| The supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| As presented, in addition to the Internal Revenue Service requirements, have these few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| provisions of Division H that were reserved in the charter to be included into the supplemental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| With regard to the various actuarial factors and information, I assume that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| that's provided to you by Mr. Pennington or some guideline in the Internal Revenue Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| The actuarial factors were provided by Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Did you carefully multiply each of those numbers out in the three million tables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| And would you say that there was anything that you thought was unusual in terms of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| incorporated in here in terms of filling out the blank spots of the plan H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| In other words, you had an attempt to try to deal with that after the plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| but to try to make it conform to the IRC, the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| Is there anything unusual that you noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| I do not think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| It's not cheerful reading for a layman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| So I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| That's why we hire Ms. Eislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| I was going to ask Mr. Swanson, but I know what he'd tell me about reading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Thank you, Ms. Eislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Item 12D is an ordinance to amend Chapter 23, Article 1 of the Knoxville City Code to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| authorize the mayor to establish rules and regulations for the operation of mobile food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| vending establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Mr. Della Voti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| This has been answered for me by Patricia, I think, earlier in a phone conversation or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| email exchange, but I think it's important to note that we are delegating to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| the opportunity or the obligation to promulgate the rules and regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| My only concern then, and it remains somewhat, is what happens when the mobile food vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| start getting too close to, too near to interfering with the brick and mortar guys who think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| they're supporting the city with their taxes, and I know that that's going to be one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| the reasons why you want the flexibility, but if someone could just address that briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| because it is somewhat unusual to delegate out the rulemaking provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| I don't see a problem with it, but I'm curious, because we'll be the ones that hear from upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| restaurants who are probably struggling these days if they have competition at the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| And we will hear from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Patricia Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| I'm sure we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Patricia Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| I am the business liaison in the Office of Business Support for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| And so this would allow us to have a food truck pilot program, and the flexibility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| is that we'll start the program and see how it works, and so we don't have to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| you every two weeks and have you change because we maybe have identified a zone that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| is not working well, or maybe we identify extra zones that might work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| And so this is just a pilot program to get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| Rick Emmett can chime in any time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| We have been interacting with both brick and mortar businesses as well as the food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| owners, and our desire is to come to a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| We've had public meetings, and we're open to talking to people and hearing their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| I know tonight we have people from the Food Truck Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| And you explained that to me earlier, and I just wanted to bring that out, because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| is a little unusual, but I appreciate the notion that you're going to have to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| do a little trial and error work and have changes as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| I appreciate that, because it is new and different in the pilot plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| Will you report back to us periodically, not obviously every two weeks, on what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| and how it's working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| I'll be happy to, and we'll be happy to have regular meetings with both the food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| owners and the public and the brick and mortar owners to evaluate how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| We have studied ordinances all over the country, and we have visited Nashville, deputies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| the mayor, Dr. Lyons, and Ms. Christy Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Rick Emmett and I have been in contact with Nashville, went to visit them, and saw the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| program work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| And this is actually that's worked really well for them, and that they have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| They were very gracious with their time and information, and that was one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| that has worked really well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| And so we are patterning this program like Nashville's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| I appreciate your diligence in doing that, and I just wanted to bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Thank you, Mr. Ablado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| 12L is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of North 6th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| north side of Abilene Place from I-3 to C-2, subject to approval of a use on review development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5477)|

| 1:31:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Now, we have two people signed up, but I believe they are here if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| Otherwise, is that your line on for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Yeah, I just turned it on because I just wanted to ask Mark Donaldson something that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| the papers but may not be obvious to folks at home, and that is that there was some concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| in the neighborhoods about the idea of C-2 having sort of no off-street parking, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| that was addressed at the MPC hearing with regard to the teardown of some peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| buildings and some acre of land that would allow some inboard parking, and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| a request, I think, for a use on review approach as one of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| If you would just address that background, because that was the sticking point, not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| conversion of this building, but what happens to the parking aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| Mark Donaldson of the MPC, I think I can answer by saying yes, just as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| There is a condition that any future development is subject to approval by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| under the use on review process, which will expose it to the adjacent neighborhoods, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| include Park Ridge and Forth and Gale, both of whom had members at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| There was discussion about the parking, which is not a requirement of C-2, but it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| that we can manage through the development plan approval process, depending on whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| particular uses are ultimately proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| So they will get notice as the plans come in for review, and they can participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| at least that oversight that you'll be doing at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5595)|

| 1:33:44| And is this Mr. Britton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| John Britton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Okay, he's signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| So, sir, please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| My name is John Britton, 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| I represent the applicant, FMC East, in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| For those of you who don't know, FMC East is Fresenius Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| They have built a kidney dialysis center on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| The next step in the process of getting that dialysis center open is to ask for this property to be rezoned from O1 to C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5653)|
| 1:34:23| in order for them to be able to put the building signage that they need to put in order to be able to open the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5663)|
| 1:34:31| so everybody will know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| So I've communicated with some of you and shared drawings of the proposed signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5672)|
| 1:34:40| Even if the signage were not something that they wanted to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| I think it makes sense to rezone this property given the fact that the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| the easternmost portion of this property was already zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| The property across Magnolia is zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| And it just makes sense for this particular piece of property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Thank you, John, for sending us the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| And more importantly, thank you for not putting a 40-foot pole sign for a dialysis clinic on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| And I do want to point that out because I think it's important as we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| and be looking at the new sign or suggestions to the new sign ordinance that this looked like a very nice plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| and I think it will fit in very nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| So thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5730)|

| 1:36:21| Do we have someone here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| Eric Mosley, 405 Montenbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Mayor and council members, thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| We initially had requested for a density of up to 5.9 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| which is allowable under low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| and we've worked with some of the adjoining neighbors and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| and ended up acquiring some additional property from the family that was selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| and we would request a density of 4.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5816)|
| 1:37:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| I think that as the rezoning is written, he's fine with what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| This is not the place to change that zoning density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| Am I correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| I guess I would defer to Mark Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| but I think it actually is the place to do it if it's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Mr. Donaldson, help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| The density would be attached to the RP1 zoning as a condition of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| so what you approve tonight is what will dictate the total number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| that will be allowed within the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| But he doesn't have to build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| But that would be up to, would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| He wouldn't have to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| It's only up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Oh, it's up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Yeah, I was just saying that as I read the papers, it asks for four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| and there was discussion at the MPC about a neighboring property having 3.25 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| and so I understand this gentleman trying to, in essence, change the recommendation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| but I don't know of any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Maybe he can give us a reason why we should vary from both the MPC recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| and approved approach of four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Why are you changing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Well, it's like I said, we ended up acquiring the old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| It was on the property that we didn't initially want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| and we reconfigured the access point to accommodate some of the concerns the neighbors had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| and we ended up with 43 housing units, which works out to 4.4 units per acre, which is, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| it's 25% less than we had initially asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| But it is not, the recommendation was for up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| And that's what was approved, right, at MPC was four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Mr. Frost, can you help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| I'm wanting to make sure I understand something here that Mr. Mosley said, because I might have misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| After this is already going through the MPC process, you acquired more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| The total acreage is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| We were not purchasing the house that was on maybe three-quarters of an acre with the total 9.85 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| but in reconfiguring the entrance and accommodating some people that lived on Creekhead Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| we ended up purchasing that house for access onto Hemboldt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Because what it sounded like to me that you had acquired more land after the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| and you were wanting that density to apply to that after-acquired land, but it hadn't been to MPC yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| No, the total acreage that was being rezoned is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| The owners were going to maintain the house on about three-quarters of an acre of the rezoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| We are now purchasing the total tract, which has added, like I said, about three or four units, which goes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6007)|
| 1:40:17| It's 4.37, I think, if you divide the numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| And within a half a mile of there, there's R2, there's RP1, up to six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| There's industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| There's quite a bit of different zonings very close to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| And we've, like I said, we've worked with the neighborhood and people that have contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| We've met with them and tried to accommodate and work any problems out with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| So you're, okay, thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| So can, I don't know that I remember having one like this where we can increase the units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| He's decreasing, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| He's increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| He's got, the motion before us is four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| He wants 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| He wants an additional .4 per unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| And that's, he's asking for an increase over what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| So we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| We can amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| We can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| We can increase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Am I correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| I don't know what, Mr. Donaldson, what was considered at MPC because you can't, we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| the city council can't take into something in consideration that was not done by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| The applicant applied for up to 5.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| The planning commission, after reviewing the development pattern of the surrounding area, recommended four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| I would say that you could consider anything between those two numbers as a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| So that being said, I think we need to amend this MPC recommendation from four units per acre to 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6124)|
| 1:42:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| So you're amending the motion at city council to approve the 4.4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| Mr. Donaldson, just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| They're moving to amend it to be 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| I first need a second on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Okay, we have that second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| And now we have a motion to amend it to 4.4, dwelling use breaker, and we have a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| Okay, so now we're talking about the amendment at 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| So before, how many units were total, and then now how many units total are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| Thirty-nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Thirty-nine originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Well, we had 58 originally with the 5.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| But under the four, I'm talking about under the four per acre, it was 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| And then now it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Yes, I'm a little concerned because there were a number of neighbors that appeared at the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| and were concerned about this development, and it looked like the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| and the full commission were trying to have a reasonable compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| recognizing that there were two other tracts nearby that had 3.25 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| And I feel a little bit like while we may be permitted to do this, it's somewhat of an in run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| It really wasn't debated at MPC in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| And I'm concerned that the neighbors are going to feel like something happened that sort of back bit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6232)|
| 1:44:02| I quite don't understand why other than I guess you're going to make a little more profit by sticking in five more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6242)|
| 1:44:11| I've met with all the people that were at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Ms. Ledbetter and the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| And what did they say about the additional units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| They're fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| You're tearing the house down and putting how many units in that spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| Well, the access is going to come off of Hemboldt instead of Creekhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| The house will be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Is the access on a busier road or a less busy road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| No, it's a much better road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| The engineering department was also in favor of this revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| Because there was concern about the access road being narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| It was like, what, 18 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| And there was some concern about flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| And they said, well, the flooding and the storm water issue will be addressed when you submit your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| You'll have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| So you're saying the neighbors are okay with the increase in density now that you've changed the road access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Mark, do you have any information on that at all, one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| We haven't been involved in any of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| And let me remind council, this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| So there will be another shot at this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| I'm just trying to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| So now we are voting on the amended motion, which would put it at 4.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6333)|

| 1:45:36| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| I think we just voted to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| Now we need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| We just amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| What did I just say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| That was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| So now we are on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| And that's ordered too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| We have nobody signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| And so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131112?start=6364)|
