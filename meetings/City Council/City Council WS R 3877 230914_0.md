| 0:06:09| consistently and relentlessly, I should say, to help prepare people and businesses for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| opportunities that will present themselves throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| We have a co-starters program that's up to my left and probably to y'all's right if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| looking behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=384)|

| 0:06:33| years or less, help them understand what it takes to operate a business, everything from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| their financials, their marketing, their legal structures, and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| We do that from March to May every year, and we do it from September to November every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=409)|

| 0:06:55| We've got nine individuals that are trying to start a business in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Next level is a more advanced seven-month program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| It's not for new starters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| It is for existing businesses, and there are some metrics that they have had to meet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| be eligible to participate in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| We have five companies that are in this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=432)|

| 0:07:17| So over a seven-month period of time, they are creating three-year growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=437)|

| 0:07:28| And we also are working to try to find individuals that are interested in careers in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| So we have a pre-apprenticeship program, and we have a registered apprenticeship program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| designed to teach individuals how to do trade skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| It's very unique in that it's craft trade, so they get to learn all their jobs that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| can do on a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| And then TOPI, that stands for Tennessee Opportunity Pilot Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| It is a statewide initiative that is trying to get people into the workforce, making livable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| wages, and we've been engaged in that process for about almost a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| So those are the three things that we're doing to try to prepare individuals and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=485)|

| 0:08:34| I think typically we do questions at the end of all of the presentations, so I think we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| go ahead and make sure we get everyone else's presentations in, and then we'll come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=524)|

| 0:08:49| Mike Odom from the Knoxville Chamber is here to give us an update on the overall, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| we kind of zoned in a little bit on some specific programs from the Urban League, and now we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| kind of going to start expanding out a little bit and looking out over the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Anyway, welcome, and we're looking forward to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| We appreciate being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Council members, thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| So to Vice Mayor's point, we're going to talk a little bit, I'm going to talk a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| bit about the overall kind of update of where we are, a lot of this information you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| from us before, and then Lauren Longmire, who's our Director of Regional Enhancement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| whose main and only job is focused on talent, will come in and talk about some programmatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| things, and I'm going to wrap it up with one more slide after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| So Will, if you don't mind, first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| So we talk often about the three demographic segments that we look at, 0 to 24, 25 to 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| which is the most critical one when you're talking, speaking of workforce, and then 55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| You can see that we've grown about, since the 2010 census, about 7% in that 25 to 54| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| That actually is double what we were about two years ago, and from a percentage basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| percentage points, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And so that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| The somewhat bad news is you can see that 55 plus continues to grow in kind of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| We often say we're getting older faster, and so that's a little problematic when you talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| about workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Will, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| So you look at that 7%, kind of compare it to how we do against our peer communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| and I should have said, this is county level, because a lot of this demographic information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| you can't get down to the city level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| So, you know, us against Chattanooga, we're looking pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Unfortunately, Memphis and Lexington are actually taking a step back, but you can see when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| compare us to places like Nashville, Asheville, and then the RTP area, we're really falling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| behind in that 25 to 54 year old age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| This is a slide that our board loves to look at and talk about, and most of the time they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| get the data wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| So economists will tell you that if you want to maintain your population, you must have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| 2.1 children for every female within your population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| And as you can see, in the state of Tennessee, we have actually, since beginning of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| we've dropped below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| We're about 1.7 right now, so we're about four-tenths behind where we need to be since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| the recession kind of got going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| We don't know what's going to happen with COVID, how COVID may affect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| We're waiting on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| As you can imagine, it's a lagging indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| But this is also something that's problematic for us as we look towards workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| And one last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| We hear often from business people that says, you know what, since COVID hit, people just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| don't want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And that actually is absolutely not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| If you look, so the county labor force has grown by over 11,000 people since the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| of COVID in February 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Our unemployment rate in between February and July is exactly even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| And today, even with that 11,400 increase, we only have 414 more people unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| Everyone that has moved here to join that labor force, we have absorbed into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| This isn't a working problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| This is that we have more jobs than we have people problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lauren and let you talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| how we're addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Welcome, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Longmire, we're looking forward to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| First, I'll talk about the work that we do with secondary education and preparing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| students for our local workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| The main initiative that we work on with that is the 865 Academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| I hope everyone has heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| But if not, it is Knox County Schools' initiative to transform their high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| It is turning all of our traditional high schools into career-themed subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| So our students will learn about a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| We hope they are excited about that career and possibly move into that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| But also, some of them may decide that's not what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And so that's also a benefit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Our role in that is we are a founding partner along with Knox County Schools and Knox Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I and also my counterpart, Madison, we serve on the implementation team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| So we meet weekly with the team to discuss any of their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Mostly, our discussions and our benefit is to assist with partner connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| We ask our businesses to do things like come to the schools and guest speak, provide opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| for field trips, work-based learning, internships, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| And so we will help our partners at KCS and KEF with those introductions to those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| And we also do just provide general insights into the business community, as Mike kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| of alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| We have a lot of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| And we're happy to share that data with our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And it works very well when we talk about what programs we need to have in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| It works great when we are able to say, here's what our workforce needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| So we do provide that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| We also focus on post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| We really focus on the retention of those graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| One of those initiatives is Home Sweet Career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| That is an initiative that creates opportunities for business and industry partners to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| with UT faculty and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| We also do speak directly to the students and educate them on local career opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| and our region's quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| If you see the Home Sweet Career logo, we created a logo because it has become such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| a popular subject and program with our UT partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| And so we created the logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| And then also, you'll see the picture, is us speaking to what they call the BETS program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| which is through the Haslam College of Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=910)|

| 0:22:34| We see where we are falling short in certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| We've got to have the ability to change with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| And so we recommended that the community go through what we call an economic transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| and focused on four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| One is we really need to drive high growth companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Those companies have the ability to grow and hire a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Two is we need to get high wage talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| We need to create those jobs where those folks have the skills and the ability to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| We need innovation startups and then we need to attract civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| We need that stickiness, that magnet that makes people want to stay in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| once they finish college or high school or whatever the case may be and want to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| So we'll go back and let Jim go and then we'll answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| We'll welcome Jim Biggs, the Executive Director of the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Jim, welcome and we're looking forward to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| And thank you, council members, for including me in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| A confession to start, when Will and I were talking about this, he originally thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| we might be talking about 20 minutes or so as a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| So yeah, there are 46 slides in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| I have no intention of going over every single one of those slides, which means, Will, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| going to have to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So Knoxville Entrepreneur Center, many of you are familiar with the work that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| but I wanted to give you a very, very brief overview of what it is, talk about why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| do it, and then look more specifically at the programs that we're doing and the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| that we're doing in collaboration with other organizations in the community that also support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Let's go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| We are now 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| We celebrated our 10th anniversary in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| We have continued to enjoy, Will, if you go to the next one, the support of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| throughout those 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| We have, in particular, been blessed to be supported by the city of Knoxville by a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| called Launch Tennessee, which is through ECD, and then a variety of sponsorships, corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and otherwise, who have helped us provide all the services we do pretty much for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| We also actually serve all 16 counties around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| So it is heavily concentrated on Knoxville, but in fact, we do a lot of work in rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| communities in partnerships with some of their economic development organizations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| So at KEC, we believe in the power of entrepreneurs to change lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| And that is why we are trying to make Knoxville the most founder-friendly city in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| The emphasis on founders is very critical, and I'll circle back to that in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| In order to do that, we are trying to create an entrepreneurial community that is accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| that is diverse, and that is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And we are doing that through a set of values that we believe should inform how that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| develops and how it conducts itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| So briefly, I want to touch on why we want to do all this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| And the reason is that entrepreneurs add both economic and social capital to any community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| The economic piece, and one more, sorry, is pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| It boils down to economic growth because of the disruptive nature of some of their innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| I won't go into this for the sake of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I'd be happy to talk about it with you if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| There is a site in here that will show some work from a guy named John Deery that looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| at why startups are such a critical factor in the economic growth of communities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| in our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| And one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| But it really boils down to two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| One is capital invested, and then the other is jobs created by these companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| The Coffman Foundation actually did a study about five years ago that showed that almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| all net new job creation is done by companies that are less than five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| Companies that are older than that more or less create and destroy jobs at the same pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| So startups are critical to job growth in a community and they're critical to invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| capital in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| So what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| The problem is over the last 50 years, we've had a pretty steady decline in the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| of businesses that are being created per capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| And you can see that trend is not going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| There was a slight blip over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Some of you may have read about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| There was essentially a COVID surge in business creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| The open question at this point is whether or not that will hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| And the reason why that's an open question is that many of the businesses that were started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| were done because people didn't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| People were not doing it because they saw an opportunity to build a business, they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| And when that is the predicate for business creation, in a lot of cases, that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| And in particular, it doesn't last because when the situation changes and they do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| a choice, they leave their business and they go back to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| So that's the economic side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| The social capital piece is really about the fact that entrepreneurs change lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And they change lives in three fundamental ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Many of you may know Jade Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| She runs an indoor plant shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| She wanted to get out of the corporate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| And so, three years ago, she started her own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| In that time, Jade has found economic independence but more importantly, she now employs something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| like 11 part-time and full-time people and she's looking for another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1709)|
| 0:28:37| Entrepreneurs change their lives and entrepreneurs change the lives of people they employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Just looking at this makes me hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Many of you have enjoyed Yusin's food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| You know that he has become a very successful entrepreneur and obviously has changed his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| life and the lives of people who work for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| But Yusin is also the first guy on the ground serving food to anybody who needs it when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| a tornado blows through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| He's the guy who goes out and creates a GoFundMe campaign for the family of a fallen first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1743)|

| 0:30:45| There is a very substantial and growing ecosystem of entrepreneur support organizations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| are helping create the most founder-friendly city in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| And if you look at this, what you'll see is basically four quadrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| On the right side of it, you're looking at mostly scalable technology companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| On the left side of it, you're talking about primarily small businesses, main street businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| folks that are not looking to scale their business but are looking to grow a successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| And then from the bottom to the top, you're looking at where they are in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| So anywhere from an idea all the way up to a growing and sustainable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1882)|

| 0:31:35| Basically they're trying to provide them with three types of resources, capital, capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Capital is the obvious one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| It's all about investing in those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Our role in that is to ensure that there is adequate capital available for those entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| that it is accessible to those entrepreneurs and ultimately that those entrepreneurs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| prepared to get that capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| So capital readiness is a big part of how they are gonna ultimately be successful in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| getting that capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| And I did wanna mention, next slide, one program that is gonna be rolling out that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Through Launch Tennessee, we will be seeing new funding opportunities for some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| startups here, particularly those that are looking for equity investment through a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| that they are calling Invest Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1945)|

| 0:32:38| The second pillar of this is capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| And that's really about entrepreneurial skills and having the talent in the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| be able to fill those entrepreneurial positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1967)|

| 0:33:10| On the technology side, you're talking about people who are working with next generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Googles and Metas, although they'll be much nicer and much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=1995)|

| 0:40:23| So thank you for sharing your presentation and a report on activity that has been carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2423)|
| 0:40:33| out most recently in an effort to increase the number of DBE contracts awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2433)|
| 0:40:46| One thing, a conversation I had with some of the contractors who seemed a bit frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| with the process was regarding the size of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2453)|
| 0:41:02| So we have minority business owners who may be able to take on a smaller contract and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| be a part of the stadium project but couldn't take on the half a million dollar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| Have there been any discussions or any efforts from your team to try to help with some negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| to find more possibilities for adding DBEs through looking at those contracts, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| subcontracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Well, thank you for the question, Council Member Parker, and the answer to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| is yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| We have been in conversations ongoing looking at trying to find ways of decoupling some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| of the, and debundling some of the larger contracts to make sure that there's room for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| some of the second tier, if you will, opportunities to come into that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| And so those are ongoing conversations that are taking place and hopefully as the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| continues to go forward for those parts and pieces that have not yet started, those will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| be some other areas where we have opportunities for some growth in some of those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| And this is one of the areas of the project that frustrates me because we had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| to require that goals are met to a greater degree than what we are requiring and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2545)|
| 0:42:37| might encourage that the prime contract, I believe it's pretty much NARC making a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2557)|
| 0:42:49| of these decisions about subcontracts, but to have that encouragement that a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| will be delayed if we hadn't met certain goals in meeting our DBE contract or goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| So that's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Do you anticipate that we will meet the 17% goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| Well what I can say is that we're striving to meet that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I don't really know if I can say that we're anticipating meeting that goal, but that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| something that we are pushing towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| What we've seen as the process is ongoing, that if you look, I believe it's the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| from June to July, there was a decrease by one in the Hispanic contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| And part of that was that company moved out of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| And so that would have been higher than what it was, but that company in and of itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| is no longer doing business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| And so again, that is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| That is what we're striving for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And literally every day, Mr. Carter and others that are on that team that was shared are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2633)|

| 0:44:04| And the apprenticeship program, this may be for someone else, might be for you, but could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| you tell us more about the apprenticeship program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2649)|

| 0:44:25| And what we're really hoping to do through all of these efforts combined together is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| mix and mesh that entrepreneurial spirit with the actual skills itself, so that we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2671)|

| 0:45:00| It's a eight-month pre-apprenticeship training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| There's instruction one night a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And then we are pairing those individuals with construction companies, and they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| to work 40 hours and learn and be out there getting on the job training, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| After eight months is up, then they will do the registered apprenticeship part, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| done online as far as the instructional side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| And then they continue to work, and we hope at that point that the construction companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| that are working with them will hire them full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| We have two other partners involved in this particular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| One is focused on instruction one night a week, and the other one is focused on onboarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| the individuals for eight months, so the contractors are not at risk in terms of onboarding them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| doing workers' comp, liability insurance, and all those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Now, they will pay for the labor just like they always would in any other case, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| eight months, they get to test-drive the worker, and the worker gets to test-drive the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| to see if they're a good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| And after an eight-month period of time, then they'll pay them directly, and the third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| that we are using now will not have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And is there a cost to them to participate in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| No, there's no cost to them to participate in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2776)|

| 0:46:39| So I think the recruiting platforms that you all have are really awesome, I mean, in sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2799)|
| 0:46:49| both the microsites that you're doing for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| We've got the labor availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Is there data related to jobs inventory or how to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Is it broken down by industry, I presume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| I'm just curious how that's collected and disseminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| So we have a list, actually, let me start over, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| So we collect the data monthly about the jobs available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| It is done through a system that we subscribe to that looks at open job postings and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| deduce them against one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| And so then we post that monthly through what we call ECHO, the Economic Conditions Outlook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| As a matter of fact, that came distributed on my way over here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| So that's out, but if any time you need that information or any business does, we can give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| it to you, put it right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Are you all scouring like job sites, like Indeed and those types of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| The system that we, excuse me, the platform that we subscribe to does it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| And so Indeed, LinkedIn, Open, Help One sites within companies, it just amalgamates it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| together and then deduces it against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| And is it broken down by sector or trade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| So right now, for instance, retail is, and it's been like that for a while, has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| our number one job opening, followed there behind manufacturing and distribution, usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2909)|

| 0:48:31| Good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| And I have a question for Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| So having been a small business owner back in my day, I just, where were you all then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| is my question, but how do you get the word out to small businesses in order to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| them with your resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| So there are a variety of different ways that we are connecting with hopefully either aspiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| entrepreneurs or actual entrepreneurs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| We have a newsletter that goes out once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| We have a fairly robust social channel, as I will confess, I am not the guy to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| that stuff, but I do know that Holly's doing a great job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| But then a lot of that work is also being talked about by our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| So I mentioned the ecosystem of entrepreneur support organizations that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| And in a lot of cases, that's sort of a mutual referral network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| So we are all collaborating to make sure that entrepreneurs find the resources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| are right for what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| So we are frequently sending people to the small business development centers and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| SCORE and to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| And they are also referring people over to us on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So a lot of it is coming in because we are working collaboratively with an ecosystem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| of organizations that are looking to make sure that those entrepreneurs get connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you very much and really appreciate all three presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3006)|

| 0:50:23| So Terrence and Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| I don't know which one of you will want to answer, so you might as well just stay close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| You mentioned about the percentage of trying to get minority contractors and subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| to work on issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| One of the things I also heard from some folks was that a lot of the larger, more successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| minority contractors were busy with other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| And so while we might, they didn't have the capacity to take on additional ones because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| of labor force, which makes me talk about this apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| So how do you find people to participate in this and how old do you have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| I mean, if it's 40 hours a week, I assume you've got to have finished high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| So to the first point of your statement, yes ma'am, that is one of the things that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| heard as well, that just in the process of needing to keep people employed and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| sure that they had work, that a lot of individuals that were interested in work took on other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| jobs as well and just capacity-wise did not have the opportunity to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| And somewhat to the flip side of that, one thing that we also heard just from individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| coming through our courses and classes that we were doing, particularly next level, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| that they were interested in doing something with the stadium, but just realized that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| even though they had the time, did not have the capacity to take on a task as large as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| As far as the qualifications for the pre-apprenticeship program, I'm going to ask Mr. Carter to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| back for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I would have to tag team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3139)|

| 0:52:33| We reach out to them and we've had some of their participants finish their program and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| then come home with trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| And then we also touch a lot of grassroots organizations that work with individuals 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3159)|

| 0:52:49| But it is a very strategic and targeted effort in terms of trying to find people who actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| want a career in the construction industry and then progress in that career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| I mean, the construction industry is wide open and many an entrepreneur starts by being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| a tradesman and then they open their own business and hire more plumbers or more carpenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| and that's how some of these big electrical firms that we have in town started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| One guy was an electrician and then he hired another and then another and that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| And we have several individuals that are doing just what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| And you said they're paid and they are 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| Is there a maximum capacity of how many people can be in the program at any one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Well, it's not a maximum that's mandated of any kind, but we do try to keep it to about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| 15 or less because that way they can get the attention they need, particularly if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| need more attention and time in one area versus the other area or different individuals need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| more time for certain reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3239)|

| 0:54:02| I'm done and I got a minute and 17 seconds left, so the next question is for the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| So when we talked about that there are plenty of jobs and plenty of people who want to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3247)|
| 0:54:15| it doesn't feel that way as someone who tries to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| So if you've done anything, any research, and this may be a, we have to have lunch kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| of conversation about where the disconnect is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Is it types of jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| A lot of women, this was the COVID was the women's recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| A lot of women went home, did childcare, did education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| Are they coming back in the workforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Are the jobs they left still available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| So I know that's a lot to unpack and I hate when we do that to y'all, but I've got a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| of questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I can do it in 30 seconds, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| So, so it's, it is that we had a, an acceleration leaving the workforce through COVID through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Just said, Hey, I was going to retire five, 10 years from now, I'm going to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| We had, as you said, women were the number one leavers of the workforce, the labor force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| through COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| They have not come back in the same numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| And the third part of this is we have a significant amount of people who during COVID have used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| this to upgrade their position and, or their compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| And that's where we're finding the biggest piece is why am I going to go for this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| when I can do this job over here and get paid a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| So the positions that are mainly open are those that pay less, not uniform, uniformly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| but for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| I have more, but that may be for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Happy to go to lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3337)|

| 0:55:45| So back to the mic, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Councilwoman Fugett referenced one of the reasons why maybe some contractors were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| One being that they had bigger contracts elsewhere, or some of you mentioned one of them moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| I'll ask it a related question, but a little differently, have there been any contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| that you all feel like have been qualified, but didn't get a shot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| To my knowledge, I can't speak specifically to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| I haven't been engaged in any conversation that would suggest to me as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| My second question is, do you all know how many individuals that, how many DBE related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3383)|
| 0:56:33| individuals are participating in any of the programs that you listed on whatever page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| There's four programs on here, but how many individuals are participating in all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| collectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| So currently we have in our co-starters course, nine that just started last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3408)|
| 0:56:56| We're entering into the second week of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| In next level, I believe we currently have eight, five, five in next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| With our TOPI project, that number is constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| That is a collaboration that we have under the umbrella of United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| And along with that, it is us, Central Hispano, YMCA, YWCA, and the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3435)|
| 0:57:25| And so individuals coming in that program are there, but they're not necessarily related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| to the stadium project in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if not now, maybe down the road, it would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| to know how many individuals you all have helped as part of this scope of work, start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| That's the number that we can get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| You don't have to have it today, but just, I think it's important for folks to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| You know, some people don't qualify, some people don't stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Some people do proceed and step, go through stages, but the Urban League enabled, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| know, this many people to have a shot to participate, I think is an important number to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| And then I had a question around individuals who want to work after the multi-use stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I don't know if that's part of the scope of this work now, or if that will even fall under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| or the Urban League will even participate into that, but are you involved in programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| or setting up programs for when the stadium opens and people want to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| That is our hope, that we will be involved in that conversation and in those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| And we would definitely want to be at the table and in those discussions to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| as the stadium is open and up and running, and you have opportunities for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| and restaurants and other entities in and around that area, that that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| we can be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| But currently, the Urban League is not under contract to do that service for the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| team or anything, any other business associated with the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| The contract that we are currently under will be running out next year, and so I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| is something that we'll be able to do ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3556)|

| 0:59:38| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3578)|

| 0:59:53| I think the 100 Knocks program is an example of that, but I'm just really, it's just amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| to see the, all of the options, if you have an idea, you have support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| So thank you for building that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| And Mr. Odom, just real fast, in 30 seconds or less, I know we discussed three buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| of age groups and population growth, but I was digging into census data for the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| few months and it looks like we do a good job with bringing in young professionals after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| that kind of college dip, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| I think the census data that I found was 72% of kids that grow up in Knoxville stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| but the people that move here, we obviously lose a certain amount after college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| I guess I would just say, it seems like post-secondary retention continues to be the top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| Working professionals come back here, like I said, and they end up in the county after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| So that little, the Home Sweet Home Career is a program focused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| Can you talk a little bit more about how that's going and any other efforts at that post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Yeah, Home Sweet Career has been a very surprising success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| I don't mean that like we didn't think it would be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| We've been a little surprised by how successful it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| It's very new, so the number, it hasn't scaled yet for the numbers, so I don't want to temper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| anything with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| This goes back to the old adage, it's a lot cheaper to keep a customer than to go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| a new customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3688)|

| 1:01:32| We have got to do a better job, especially, I mean, this is all across our post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| institutions, but UT is the largest, it's going to have the largest impact, and as their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| enrollment continues to increase, it's even more imperative of us to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| We've got to align the degrees with the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| We've got to bring the jobs that these kids want to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| And then again, that civic furniture, we've got to have that magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| So those are kind of those three big components that we've got to hit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| We're doing better, we're getting 25 to 29 is up, that's going to be more your post-graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3720)|

| 1:02:09| 35 to 39 is up, which is good, but our 40 to 49 is dipping pretty significantly, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| not sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| We think it would be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| And I'm going to move on, I've got other lights on, but we'll come back to you, Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3737)|

| 1:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3744)|

| 1:02:27| Okay, so I had a few other questions about the apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| It would have been better to wrap it up at the time, but that's okay, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3752)|
| 1:02:42| Help me understand, Urban League went through a process for the apprenticeship program to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| be recognized by the state, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Can you help me understand what that does for the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| Well, it gives it the credibility and the validation it needs in terms of it being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| credential program in such a way where the kids can take that credential and say they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| want to go to another state and work in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| That credential will follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| It took about a year to go through the process, and the state local labor board held our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3790)|
| 1:03:20| and walked us through the process, the forms we needed to fill out, at what stage we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| to do different things for them, and then we had to do the same thing at the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| level for the registered apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| And what process did you go through to bring on people who could provide the training for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| the apprenticeship program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| So there's an organization called Building Traditions, and the instructors that are teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| the class, they are a part of that organization, and they've been doing that for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| In fact, they were doing that and continue to do that just as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| We just happened to get lucky, and they wanted to partner and collaborate with us in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| And part of that, I think, for them was, as we understand it and have been told and informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| construction craft training is unique in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| And this will get the people involved or the participants, they'll reach their apprenticeship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| level in two years versus four or six in some other trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| And so my colleagues asked some questions that helped identify who the candidates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3867)|
| 1:04:36| for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| What I'm trying to imagine is they're recruited into the program, and then the program goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| out to look for the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Well, we're actually trying to do that simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| So we have flyers and material that we have prepared for construction companies, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| did the same thing for program participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| So we're doing them both simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| As we speak now, Building Traditions and Urban League are calling some of the primes on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| stadium project in particular to see what their workforce needs are, how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| they need, and what type of skills they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| And then we're trying to work to get that aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| Are you seeing applicants for the apprenticeship program leaving another job to join the apprenticeship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3917)|

| 1:05:25| We have not seen them leaving other jobs to do the apprenticeship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Most of the time, they're looking for a job, and that's why they enroll in an apprenticeship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Our real challenge is making sure we can find contractors quickly enough, because every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| time they walk through our doors, the message for us loud and clear is, we needed a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3939)|

| 1:05:46| So if the contractors are not right there and have that workforce need right then, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| they will continue to try to find another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=3950)|

| 1:06:49| And as they move along the professional ladder, they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| And so there's a lot of instability all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4013)|

| 1:07:00| And so our team is working very closely with them to do it, to kind of be able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| them grow this and really get more young professionals involved so that it does become a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| more sticky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4030)|

| 1:07:24| If you want to ask a question, do you want each of them to answer it before your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4044)|

| 1:08:33| And so what we're hoping and wanting to do is within that space, create a couple of pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| that will help to build foundation and keep them here and active so that they are contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4121)|

| 1:08:51| And one of the ways that we're really honed in on that is working with them to train them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4131)|
| 1:09:01| and to get them equipped for service in community and on boards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4141)|

| 1:15:03| Mr. Biggs, you had mentioned in your presentation that the startup density is dipping, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4503)|

| 1:15:15| Is that a local statistic or is that a national statistic that you were showing us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| The chart that you saw was a national trend, but it is reflected in the local economy as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| So that is an aggregate across the entire U.S., but there is almost no place that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4528)|

| 1:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| I guess in your experience just here locally, are you seeing that as well that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| we had a surge during COVID when maybe people were afraid that their jobs they wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4545)|

| 1:15:56| Just, you know, anecdotally as you're looking at, not necessarily the data, but just what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| you're seeing out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| I don't think we've seen as big a drop off as I might have expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| The chart that I showed on that one was also from the Kauffman Foundation data and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| call it their opportunity index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And essentially what it looks at is the number of people who were, who started a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| that were not looking for work or unemployed at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| And they showed a significant, if it drops, it basically means that more people are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4593)|

| 1:16:43| For us, I have seen fairly resilient businesses and fairly sticky businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| So a lot of the stuff that we saw get started over the last couple of years, I think Jade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| Adams is a good example of that, have actually become sustainable businesses that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| are holding on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| But that trend also tends to play out over the course of three or four years as jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| recover and other things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| So it may be too early to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| I'm going to stop my time at that point and call on Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I'm still on the topic of young professionals and hearing solutions proposed for how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4641)|
| 1:17:33| retain or attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| But I'm a little concerned because it's not necessarily overlapping with what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| And I'm sure that you all are well informed by evidence-based reports that you're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| And I'm listening to what I'm hearing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4674)|
| 1:18:02| But the civic furniture is an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| Can we talk about civic furniture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Now, what type of amenities are you including in that that will appeal to this demographic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4689)|
| 1:18:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Council Member Parker, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And it's one we get often, obviously, because we bring this topic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| And the answer is we don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| So I'm a 50-year-old white heterosexual male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| I'm not exactly the target audience for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| What we want is the community to start to tell us, hey, if I'm going to stay, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| are the types of things that I want to see in my community in order to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Now, and so that's really what we're doing is the outreach to say, what do you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| What will help you stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| And we've just started that work recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| So we don't have any, really, results at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I do think that there could be some greater collaboration when it comes to these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4737)|
| 1:19:07| between the work that you're doing, the work that we're doing, the work being done at planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Because I see shifts being made in Knoxville that are moving it away from the city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| I ran around in as a 20-something-year-old who worked downtown and had multiple places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| to go for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Now, a lot of people think downtown was dead 20 years ago, but we had multiple dance clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4773)|
| 1:19:42| downtown, and that is something we've moved away from as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| That's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| What I'm hearing from folks is that things like baseball tends to attract an older audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| rather than the younger audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| So I would be curious of what data that you are able to gather around this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| Because it seems like we're saying we want to keep young folks here, but we're committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| to a sleepy town kind of vibe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| It's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| To use the two examples you mentioned, the ballpark, it's older in terms of family, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4822)|
| 1:20:31| terms of 30-something is typically the demographic that a ballpark of that will attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4831)|
| 1:20:39| Other communities I've lived in, that's what they drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| The younger things, you mentioned the dance clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| That's really where we want the free market to come in and say, hey, we believe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| enough demand here to open a dance club, and we want to put it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| So that's where, for us, it's not going to be, hey, we're not going to go in and open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| that club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| What we're going to try to do is retain and attract the young people that will make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| economics work for an entrepreneur to go and start that business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| And so there's a different kind of, there's an alignment that has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| Some of this will be driven by government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Like you make the investment in the ballpark, there's other things that are probably, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| some of it will have to be done by the market itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Some will have to be done by the business community that says, hey, we believe this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| even though maybe the economics aren't perfect, we think our community needs to do this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| so we want to invest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Certainly not suggesting the Chamber of Commerce opening a dance club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Could be interesting, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Again, you don't want me owning the dance club, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| But in terms of all of our planning and efforts towards this retention, are we butting heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| on things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| The other thing I have questions about are more around the startups and the young, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4913)|

| 1:22:13| I think this was mentioned a bit, there's a slowdown in that demographic of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4933)|

| 1:22:41| What are you hearing in the community about difficulties that startups and newer businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4961)|

| 1:22:58| So I think we are all familiar with the fact that real estate has gotten more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| in Knoxville and some of the entrepreneurs that we work with who were in spaces actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| can no longer afford the rent that is being charged or the buildings have been sold outright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| and then the new owners are looking to change the use of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| So we have seen in some cases some displacement of entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| They tend to be small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| You mentioned food services in particular, but some of the other services businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| So finding affordable space in the right location has become a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| I will also say access to capital has also become a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| I will also tell you that in no community anywhere in the world do entrepreneurs come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| in and say there's too much capital here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| So we are not alone, but Knoxville has seen less investment in its small business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5036)|
| 1:24:06| than in some of the other places that I think have been successful there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| That is something that both the Entrepreneur Center, the Chamber, and also the Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| are actively working on, both in terms of trying to create new pools of capital that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| are available specifically to address certain types of lending or investing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5061)|
| 1:24:30| So loans from $5,000 to $25,000 that can be a challenge sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| On the equity side, there's some types of investment that are harder to find here than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| But I think we are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| The Chamber recently relaunched a fund in partnership with Pathway Lending called the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| Opportunity 865 Fund, which is creating opportunities for those small businesses looking for lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| loan amounts to be able to work with Pathway to solve their capital access needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| So there is work in progress, but I think there's work to be done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| So when we look at a program like 100 Knoxville, you've reported on how much has been invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| how many businesses you're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Are you tracking our progress towards growing black-owned businesses by 10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5116)|
| 1:25:27| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| And in fact, we do an annual survey with the graduates of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| That survey is outstanding right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| And so I don't have the data for this year, but we should have that probably later this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| But yes, ma'am, we are tracking that very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Can you share what the data was for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Because the program was new, we didn't even do the survey last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| So we have some incoming data for people who have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| And this is the first time that we've gone back out to essentially two years' worth of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| graduates and said, all right, now we need to know how you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| The first year, so if you think about where we were after the first year, some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| folks had only been done with the program probably for five weeks by the time we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| have been surveying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| There wouldn't have been a meaningful increase in anything relative to where they came into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| So we've been giving it a little bit of time to be able to have some progress against those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| What concerns me about our commitment to these programs and ensuring that we have a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5190)|
| 1:26:41| that will ensure they are successful is that we create an expectation in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5201)|
| 1:26:51| when they hear $100 million going towards the African-American community, $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| going towards black-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| And after a few years, they think, well, goodness, we have invested and focused so much on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| minority community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| We need to shift our focus elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| But in reality, we haven't really made the investments at the time that we needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| make in order to realize those goals that we set for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| So are you feeling confident at this moment that the level of investment that's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| put into that 100 program will result in that $10 million in growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5250)|
| 1:27:40| We are certainly optimistic about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| It was an ambitious goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| I think we wanted to shoot high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| But we also do have some entrepreneurs who have come through the program that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| will make a substantial sort of impact in our ability to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5276)|
| 1:28:04| But I think as with any aspirational goal, there are no guarantees that we will get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| But we are going to work our best to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Is there room to reevaluate, especially with the rising cost, with small businesses losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| their spaces, to think about how assistance can be provided perhaps at a higher level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| now to keep some of that displacement from happening so that participants in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| are able to continue forward towards that goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| So I guess I'll answer that in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| First, we are constantly reevaluating the program and looking at whether or not we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| both the way the program is structured and also the way that we are offering funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| to those entrepreneurs is meeting the goals that we hope to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| And in fact, we are in the process of rebuilding some of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| And we'll be able to share more about that probably in early 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| The second part of it is we don't have the resources at KEC to be able to make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| right now, but I would certainly welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| So if there's a conversation about being able to add more fuel to the fire, I'm absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| We are very fortunate that we've had partners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| So to be clear, all of the grant money that has gone out has actually been privately raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| None of that has been the city's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| The city has been able to provide us with some operational support, but the grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| is actually coming from corporate sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| Many of them are very happy to be a part of the program, but I don't know that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| a lot of capacity to increase that giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| So I think we'd have to be looking at other sources of capital for it, but I'm certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| open to that conversation and would welcome opportunity to do even more to support those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| I had a question for each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| Thinking about the changes that are going on in the overall economy now, and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| we're going to see accelerate into the future, you're certainly seeing the emergence of artificial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| intelligence to a much higher degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| We're transitioning from the information age to the imagination age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| I wanted to get a sense from each of you about what you're seeing in the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| in our community, particularly thinking about the jobs of today and certainly into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5448)|
| 1:30:58| kind of skills that you're seeing out there, skills that we need to be shoring up or improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| on, resilience, adaptability of the workforce, creativity, imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5465)|
| 1:31:14| Obviously, when you're talking about entrepreneurs and folks that are getting businesses started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| there's an element of creativity and imagination that's going on in that and skill level in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| order to be able to get to that point, but just if you each could just take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| and talk to us about your experience, what you're seeing on the ground with the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| that you're exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| We'll start with the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| We were sitting here jockeying who was going to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| So one of the things that I think that we've seen, and primarily in our, not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| even workforce components, but in our youth and education efforts, we're seeing a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5516)|

| 1:32:20| hone in on the technology aspects of how we're evolving as a society, as a culture, and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5540)|
| 1:32:30| making sure that we have a youth base and a rising workforce that's going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| While that is the case, I think kind of going back to the conversation that we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| been had, we're seeing that there is a huge need for skills and trades within our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5561)|
| 1:32:49| and that's something that we're seeing in conjunction with the Stadium Project and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| and so that's an area where we're going to continue to focus and make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| ensuring that that's a space where people can operate because, again, that's a need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and it's also a need that's going to produce an opportunity and wages that are comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| to that of a four-year degree, if not better in some instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| And so we're seeing a rise in technology, but we're also seeing the skills and the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5596)|
| 1:33:25| rising as well, especially as we're digging deeper into the work of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Thank you for the question, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| So what we're seeing is we knew that there was going to be a push to automation as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| move towards this imagination age, as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| We're seeing it escalate faster than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| We have companies coming to us saying, hey, you know, we've been trying to hire people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| now for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| We just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| We're going to automate this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| AI has accelerated even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| So even now, the numbers don't even justify what we're seeing in generative AI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| It's becoming fast and furious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| We know that the vast majority of jobs that are going to be available in 2030 have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| even been invented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| And so we have to prepare for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| So Charles mentioned a little bit of it, is we're hearing from employers, and Laura mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| this, our work with 865 Academies, is another part that we have to do is we have to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| these kids, this is what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| These are the jobs that are going to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| This is going to be the availability of it, and this is the compensation it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| So you need to start building these skills as they select the Academy pathway they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| And then the last piece of that is we've really got to find and identify and really go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| those jobs that are going to succeed in that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| Those companies that are going to have those roles are going to be critical, because for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| us to be able to succeed in this next generation, this next industrial revolution, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| to have those roles and that talent to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| So I guess Mr. Odom and Dr. Lomax have covered most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5711)|
| 1:35:19| Let me add two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| One, technology evolving is not new, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| We've been doing this for 150 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| It's the application of technology that really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| And so if you're looking specifically at something like AI, AI is going to displace some jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| It's going to change how we work, but it also opens up an opportunity for people who know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| how to work with that technology to create new jobs, the jobs of the future, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| So understanding the application of evolving technology, I think, is the way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| really help people be successful going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| The other thing that I think that is both a threat and an opportunity that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| is that remote work is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| And it's a threat because we've seen in a number of cases, places like Salesforce and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| Amazon come into developer shops in Knoxville, hire people away, literally offer them two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| to three X what they were making, and they don't have to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| They're going to stay here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| They'll be paid a Bay Area salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| And there's no way that most of our employers can compete with something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| The flip side is that those folks can now work from anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| And so you are seeing an influx of people who are choosing to live in places like Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| but they're still working for companies that are located in places like San Francisco and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| So I think we have an opportunity to continue to attract folks to a place that has a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| cost of living, a higher quality of life in many cases, who have a choice of where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| want to be because they are not tethered to a desk anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| That's what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| I did mean to turn my light off, but I will say that the recruitment I do believe is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5824)|
| 1:37:17| that has to be a balanced approach, and I just don't have a sense of where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| But I am definitely seeing the advertising, PR done by different entities in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| to other cities working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| And we're seeing folks with a higher income moving into our city, and we're seeing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| ramifications of that and that we're not ready for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| So we may have employers who are ready for certain new employees, but do we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| infrastructure in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Do we have the housing that is needed for recruiting this new workforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| So that's just one thing that I lift up is that we look to have balance in these activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5882)|
| 1:38:10| and look for those unintended consequences that can come that could then drive that population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5890)|
| 1:38:19| we just recruited out of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| I think many have said this before, but I think the secret is out about Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| People are, just like each of you had talked about, making determinations to move here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| and there's, like Mr. Biggs was saying, opportunities for work that is not, that's remote, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| could really work from anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| And so there is a large piece of this, just like Councilmember Parker was alluding to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5935)|
| 1:39:04| we've got to make sure we have a lot of opportunities here, not just the jobs, but also the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5944)|
| 1:39:12| for somebody to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| And the civic furniture that Mr. Odom was talking about and the interesting activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5954)|
| 1:39:23| which I think when you think about natural resources in our community, I would put us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| up against anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| We've got all kinds of great things here in Knoxville to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| So it's not surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| We actually did well to keep it to ourselves for as long as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| Anyway, I think there's a lot to this to unpack, and certainly having more jobs than we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5982)|
| 1:39:51| people is probably adding to that demand that we're seeing, and I don't see that stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| But I know that our Councilmembers have a forum that they have to be able to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| so we'll go ahead and close down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622_202309?start=6005)|
