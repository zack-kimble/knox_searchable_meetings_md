| 0:00:00| Thank you, fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| This meeting of the January 2016 work session is called to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=12)|
| 0:00:23| And is Colonel Julian here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| I do not see Colonel Julian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| Commissioner Oyenbee, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| Everyone, please stand and give the proper salute to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=47)|
| 0:00:52| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=57)|
| 0:01:18| The first thing that we need to do, just right off the bat this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| is to discuss the fact that we're up against a time constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| Right now the hour is 5.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| It is my proposal that we adjourn at 5.45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| allowing us five minutes to leave the benches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| and allow the city of Knoxville, who has normally a scheduled meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| coming up at 6 o'clock, giving them time to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Do I hear objection to using 5.45 as an adjournment time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| Hearing no objection, that will be our time-specific adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=123)|
| 0:02:14| Setting the agenda for tonight, we have Items 4, 5, and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| which I first thought we would continue and have those next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| We will have those next Monday, but I have a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Yes, so I would just like to add my name to both Items 4 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| Myself as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Commissioner Brad Anders is also requesting to be added to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| I think he can put all of us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| That's what I was going to request, is that all of us go on there unless there's any objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| There being no objection, we will have unanimous sponsorship of Items 4 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=177)|
| 0:03:11| Continuing on with the agenda, does everyone have a little handwritten, I'll call it cheat sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| to enable us to make our consent calendar look more like the minutes will appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| and that I have a list, a column of items that are on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| the item numbers being 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 through 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| Now then, 23 to 27, what did I pull out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| 26 will not be on consent, 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| And Item 33 will be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| So as we have normally done this in the past, we've listed what is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| So if you're a little cheat sheet in front of you, we will discuss 7, 11, 12, 15, 22, 26, and 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=242)|
| 0:04:19| 26 wasn't on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| 26 is the one that has been pulled by a fellow commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| 26 will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| I just have one question on 13 that I always ask in this kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Is there any additional personnel that will be hired to administer these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| And that's all I was wanting to ask on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Do we need to pull that so we can ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Yes, we do, 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=291)|

| 0:06:29| Move for approval of the modified amended agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=389)|

| 0:06:38| Commissioner Brown, do we have a discussion item from the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=398)|

| 0:07:01| Question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Since we have one recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| do we need a resolution drawn to that effect before Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| or do we just put it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| No, we need a resolution added to the agenda for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| to add the name of Jim Morrison as a member of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=440)|

| 0:07:35| Seeing no further lines, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| I just want to make a motion that we approve the agenda with said amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=459)|

| 0:08:14| Or a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| To approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=500)|

| 0:08:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=504)|
| 0:08:34| Madam Clerk, I think the first item is item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Item seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Item seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| It's on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| It's a resolution reappointing Rachel Somolsky and Skip Turner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| and appointing two commissioners to the Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I believe you had the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Would you present that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| I already serve on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| and the two openings are from Commissioner Wright and from Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Their term has already expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| And we are term limited by state establishment of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| So you see there are three commissioners that are not eligible to be appointed to the Ag Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Do I see volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Commissioner Busler has raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| Commissioner Orenby had also raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| And Brantley had raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Mr. Brantley is a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Brantley is a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Oh, Mr. Brantley is a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Commissioner Orenby, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| I'm a city boy, so I'll defer to the farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| What we have before us is two volunteers to place names on that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| being Commissioner Busler and Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| The motion is properly before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| Page 3, item number 11 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| for the Knox County Schools as shown on the attached list of grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| and in the total amount of $19,435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| The reason that I pulled this particular item and the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| I also have an explanation for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| 203 grants is a change for the process by which the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| had been delivering to us these reception, application, and approval of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| The total amount of dollars is $19,435.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| As I looked at this, $14,435, or 36 individual grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=667)|
| 0:11:17| are from the Junior League of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| providing from small dollars up to an amount of $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| in individual school locations to assist students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| in whether it be reading or books or material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| or in one instance a hot dog cart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| so that this particular group could get experience in entrepreneurial activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=702)|
| 0:11:51| There was also maybe two other grants for $2,500 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| One was from the Tennessee Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| a Perkins grant to the CTE High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and also a $2,500 grant to South Knox Elementary from Youth Services America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| As we have had these before us in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| there's always been several, several items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| Now it's all consolidated into one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| and in particular I appreciate Junior League of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=742)|

| 0:13:11| We have donations in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| This one is kind of special in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| in that it is through a donor website called donorschoose.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=797)|
| 0:13:27| The name that I find is Gary Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| The amount that was read there by the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| this is a grant providing ten chairs that look like exercise balls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=815)|
| 0:13:45| to allow special education kids to be involved in something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| that's a little bit different in the classroom to encourage their learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=830)|

| 0:14:36| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| The only thing I need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| is there any additional personnel to be hired to administer this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| This is Dr. Clifford Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Your address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Mr. Chair, I would ask that Ms. Millicent Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| who is the Executive Director for Curriculum and Instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| to be able to come down and sort of clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| And your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Millicent Smith, 10063 Madison Ridge Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| And the Teacherpreneur Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| that's a partnership between the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| and the Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| where they work with innovative teachers and award mini-grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| It works very similarly to the Junior League mini-grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| It's just the mission of the Teacherpreneur Grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| to recognize innovative practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and no personnel are attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| It's really just the same sort of proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| that you would find in the Junior League mini-grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| only it recognizes and incentivizes innovative practices in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=948)|
| 0:16:00| And then the grants are listed in our packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| and which school they actually go to, of the 12 schools that they go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| That's something that's a little bit new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| and that all of these things are in our package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| You just have to now go and look at it a lot more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Any other questions of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Ms. Smith, congratulations in your future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| You're retiring after what, Millicent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Well, now I'm not retiring, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I'm not quite old enough to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| But I've spent 24 years total in the state of Tennessee as an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| 22 in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| So kind of bittersweet to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| but I have a third grader that she'll be glad I can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| She's going to get to be a car rider sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| with me picking her up and not a designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| So kind of looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| New adventures for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Ms. Smith also worked with us on the Sesquicentennial Committee, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| So thank you for your help there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| That's easy for you to say, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I wouldn't try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| It took me two years to learn it, but we were three years in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Madam Clerk, Item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1042)|

| 0:21:07| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I guess you want to send these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| These two because they both have holes in them we should send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| Make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Discussion, seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1282)|

| 0:22:00| Seeing no discussion, motion is properly before us to forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1325)|

| 0:22:12| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Item number 30, resolution 901 is approving an amendment to the Jackson Depot redevelopment and urban renewal plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| to provide for tax increment financing for the Cortland Group development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| which includes the redevelopment of the property located at 202 West Magnolia Avenue and 317 Ogden Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| This particular item are we going to discuss tonight because I'd like to hear someone talk about the facts and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1355)|
| 0:22:46| Dr. Lyons is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you, Chairman Wright and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| I'm Bill Lyons, 607 Union Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| And with me, right behind me, is Dawn Michelle Foster, who I want to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| She's replacing, to the degree that he can be replaced, Bob Wetzel, who is our redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| So Dawn Michelle Foster is our new director of redevelopment for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| and she may come on up here to get into some of the details more so than the broad brush I will give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| This is for a 15-year tax increment financing agreement for a project known as the Muse II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| and the Muse II, as you can see, is on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| It fills in an area of great importance to the city as we're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| It will be condominiums as we're moving from the downtown and the old city area toward the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| So it's a higher risk development closer to the interstate and one that's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| sort of pushing the frontiers of redevelopment out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| We have reviewed this with Mayor Burchett and with Finance Director Chris Caldwell as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| and shared the project with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Any specific questions, I'd be glad to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| This, again, is key to what our moving inside out and especially concentrating on energy to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| I think it's important that we get economic development and investment heading east as well as north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| and south and west, which we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| It's not a question but a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| I think you all are moving at a fairly slow pace, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| As I said last time, you had Big Don's elegant junk store as being Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| I took issue with that, and I'll also say this is a step, but it's still a small step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| I would venture to say that most folks consider this still downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So we're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| I've been on commission right at eight years, and we're still downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Let me briefly respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I know you have time pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I agree this is still closer to the core than east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| but we're very excited about having a public meeting later this week on the redo of Magnolia and the model blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1501)|
| 0:25:10| And, of course, we can only bring a tax increment financing project when we have a private investor willing to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| So we're trying to set the stage for that and encourage that build, I would say, block by block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| It's not brick by brick, but close enough, heading to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And we definitely agree with you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| We'd like it to go more quickly, and we're encouraged that we have more interest heading that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| So I hope we should be bringing more of these along, and most of them toward the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| But I concur with your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| If there be no further discussion, we have a motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Item 31, Resolution 902, is to approve a lease agreement with the USPG Portfolio 5 LLC for satellite office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| located at the Crossroads Center in the Halls Community for the Knotts County Clerk, Knotts County Trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| and the Knotts County Sheriff for a six-year term with the option to extend for one additional four-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| with an annual minimum rent of $63,072 for the first year of the lease and increasing each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Are there any questions, or does the bringer of the resolution wish to speak, or Commissioner Charles Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| Is this the one Foster's doing out in North Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| It is, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Is Foster here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Yeah, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| He's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Yeah, he's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Foster Arnett, Knotts County Clerk, 1236 Forest Brook Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Foster, can you explain why we're doing the move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| The location where we are right now is about 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| There's about 6,000 square feet downstairs that is not usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| We're moving across or asking to move across the street into the old Walmart part of that location over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| We'll have a nicer space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| We'll all be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| It's easier to get into and out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Traffic light controlled right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Better parking, better office space, $1,400 less a month to the taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Mr. Trustee, did you move over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Would you like to say a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I'm a bit player in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| I have two ladies out there eight months of the year, and Foster has shown me the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| They look good, so we're just moving along with him, as is the sheriff's office, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| So we're happy with the move, and if we can save money and it would be more convenient, we're in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I hope you guys support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| That's the Knox County trustee, Mr. Ed Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| Mr. Smith, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Foster, you didn't point out that also the cost of the retrofit will be borne by the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Yeah, the landlord's going to pay for our buildout, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| It's going to save us about $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| If there be no other comments, it's properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Item number 32, resolution 903, is appropriating $30,000 from the general fund criminal court excess fees account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| to be used for improvements to the criminal Fourth Circuit and criminal sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Clerk of Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Mike Hammond, 400 Main, Suite 149.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| I come before you today as I promised I would last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| You may recall that we turned over approximately $1.2 million to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and I said I would like to come back and request that a fraction of that be used to improve our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| Again, this was for the courts, not the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| When I was on commission, we did not approve a lot of money for the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| As a result, over the years, it has taken its toll, and I wanted to show you some examples of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| This is a chair that is actually used in one of our sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| As you can see, it's extremely worn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| It's damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| This is one of several chairs that we would like to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Secondly, you see these chairs in our criminal court clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| They have no arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| They have one arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| They only have the other arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| It is in use, and people are sitting in these chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We also have a number of chairs that are stained, and we're using them because we have nothing else to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| We also, as I mentioned, have damaged chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| They're snagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| They're stained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Look at this chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| It's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| We don't have very many children that go into our criminal court clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| and so this is one of the chairs that people are asked to sit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Frankly, a man of my advancing years, if I had to sit there, I wouldn't be able to get back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| We also have a lot of mismatched chairs, and I call your attention to the one on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| This is, again, one of our criminal court clerk courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| That is a chair that's kind of a bar stool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| What we've done over the years is we have taken chairs that have been thrown out in the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| and we've taken them and we've brought them into our courtrooms for use because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| we didn't have much of anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Our walls are damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| This is Division II Criminal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| You can see there's a big hole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| There are holes in a couple of our other courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| We would like to get those repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| We have dated desks and tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Now, we could use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| I'm not saying we couldn't, but I'm just saying that with the excess funds that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| we would like to make our courtrooms, not Taj Mahal's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| but to make them look a little nicer when the public goes in to present their cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| and when the jurors are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I did not bring you pictures of our places where our jury is seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but we're going to have to address the chairs where our jurors are sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| This is on our first floor right outside my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| We have an attorney-client consultation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| This is used frequently because as people are coming out of the courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| frequently lawyers will go in to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| They like to have privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| If you're having a court case being heard, you don't want everybody to hear your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| You like to have a private place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| What we're suggesting is that we have this same type of area outside our Fourth Circuit office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Fourth Circuit is our family court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| That's where we have orders of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| We have divorce, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Right now, attorneys, if they want to talk to their clients privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| they go in to the stairwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| We're asking that an attorney-client consultation area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| similar to what you saw on the first floor, be established here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Right now, we have these tables sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Again, not very conducive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| If you're taking out an order of protection against someone, you need to talk to your lawyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| or if you want to fill out the paperwork, you just need some privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| So we're asking for that privacy seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Again, stained chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| This is in our judicial magistrate's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I want to call particular attention to that office, which is on L1 near the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| That operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| So if it's Christmas, we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Saturday morning at 2 a.m., we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| We have a lot of stains in the carpet down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm concerned that we might be getting some mold-type issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| I don't think that we do, but I would like to see us replace that carpet before it does become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1965)|
| 0:32:54| This we have to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Again, this is in our magistrate's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| This is a risk area, and so we have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| We have to do something in that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| But also make mention of the fact that we do operate 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| So if it's 3 o'clock in the morning and you get hungry and you're working in the magistrate's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| you would like to have a place where you can warm up a Hot Pocket or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| This is the appliance that we're using now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| This is the microwave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| It has been cleaned, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| But as you can see, it's rusty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| It's dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| We want to be able to provide our employees with something a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| We have 10 court areas, four sessions courts, three criminal courts, a Fourth Circuit court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| the judicial magistrate's office, and also a child support court over in the old courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| I could bring you more pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| I think you get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| We're just asking that you give us an opportunity to have a fraction of the money that we turned over to improve our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| I'll be happy to take any of you on a tour, if you would like, to show you more of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Many of you have already seen the juror area and how we had 50 people show up this morning for criminal court jury duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| And you've seen the area where they're cramped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We want to be able to improve the area by moving them down the hallway a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and that's part of what the money would be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| I'm very happy to send you a complete listing of the monies that will be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| and exactly what they're being spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| The judges are going to be very involved as we move forward in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| These are just some of the pictures that I wanted to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| We may not need the whole amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| We're going to be as frugal as we can be, but we know that improvements need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| So I would appreciate your giving us the opportunity to have these funds to improve our courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| How much money are you asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| That would approximately be $2,000 per court plus the jury area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| If there is no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| 34 is the spread of record in the Knox County Mayor's Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| appointing Paul Harrison to the Board of Commissioners of the West Knox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| Number 35 is deferred until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| Item 36 is a discussion regarding the Safety Center proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Moved to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Moved to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Item 37 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| We will have in the hopper a resolution for Jim Morrison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| and then we will have a discussion item that will still be pending for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2149)|
| 0:36:00| We will have a resolution, but we will also have a discussion item related to the results of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2160)|
| 0:36:09| Both on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| The last item then is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Item number 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| It's a discussion to recognize the Knox County Sheriff's Office Shoplifter Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| And Commissioner Schoonmaker is wanting that to move on to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2184)|
| 0:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| There's a couple, three things that I need to make comment to before we vacate the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| One being the, it's being extended to employees of Knox County, the Healthy Living Expo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2202)|
| 0:36:54| Now, if you do not have tickets to the Healthy Living Expo, I have four free tickets in my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2214)|
| 0:37:03| And if you need more than that, I can help you get those tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| The Healthy Living Expo is this Friday and Saturday, the 22nd and 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2227)|
| 0:37:16| Also, you should use these Healthy Living Expo tickets because at our next scheduled meeting Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| the Rural Metro Ambulance will have one of their five new ambulances here on the front area of the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2245)|
| 0:37:35| to show off their new equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And I think they have requested an opportunity to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| And then the last thing that I have in the way of announcements is to the Ed and Bob Roadshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2265)|
| 0:37:57| Ed and Bob Roadshow, Wednesday, the 20th, 5 to 7, halftime pizza and pal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| You do it the correct way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| The only thing is we've decided to postpone it because we don't want any of our constituents getting out in the snow tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| And I fear if I said that, it won't snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| So that's why I thought we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| We'll postpone it and we won't do it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Just make sure nobody's out and it's unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Maybe, yeah, a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| But we'll have more information next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| You'll be worthless a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| The time is drawn now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| And I know that there are some people that signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| I would at least like the chairman of the NAACP, if it looked like we would have five minutes available for him, for him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2319)|
| 0:38:51| His five minutes would leave no time for anyone else to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| But, you know, there's been publicity in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| There's an opportunity now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| And I would say that most of the other people that have signed up to speak are probably for the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| And as I would state again, there could be other people to speak to the other side of the issue, and they wouldn't have any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Is he willing to divide two and a half minutes, excuse me, five minutes into two and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| If there's someone here for the other side that wants to speak, if they would kind of let me know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| We need to move now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| The will of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| Nothing else for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Folks have gotten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| It's a cold day today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Folks have gotten out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| I have had calls today asking to be on public forum, and I have said that there was not public forum on the commission agenda for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2390)|
| 0:40:01| Well, I understand that, but people have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| People signed up for public forum today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| They didn't have your number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Everyone doesn't have your number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| I believe that the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| But they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| The process is you show up, you sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| I'm not disagreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| People that have signed up for public forum, though, have been given the word, and I'll have to ask to verify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| that there wasn't public forum tonight because we were running short of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| So there may be people that have left due to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| Let me ask the commission office, am I correct in that, that there have been people who have called and asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| and I have said through the commission office that there would be no public forum tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| We should have publicized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| This is a very vocal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| This is an issue that has gotten, you know, on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| It's a shame that some folks were given their names today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2459)|
| 0:41:10| and led to believe that they would be allowed to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| You have constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I have constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| And there was nothing to us that said that they would not be allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| My entire time here, we've always allowed the public to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Something's changing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| The difference may be that I do not find public forum stated on today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| People have spoken during our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| They have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| They have, and you know that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Oh, I most certainly know they have, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And it's all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Were you referring to Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Dr. Butler, we are at 542.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| You have half the time to 545.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2520)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2536)|

| 0:42:28| The Knoxville Branch NAACP opposes the Knox County Commission's approval of construction contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| of the new Knox County schools at this time because construction of the proposed schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| will likely result in unjustified, adverse, disparate impact on students of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| On November 13, 2015, the Knoxville Branch NAACP requested that the U.S. Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| Office of Civil Rights investigate concerns relating to the discriminatory use of capital funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| for the new school construction by Knox County School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| On December 18, 2015, the Knoxville Branch NAACP, as well as the Knox County School District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| was informed that the OCR will investigate whether the district plan for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| of Gibbs Middle School will result in resegregation and noncompliance with Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| Knoxville Branch NAACP respectfully yet strongly insists that the Knox County Commission cease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| any further action on school construction or construction decisions until completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| of the U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights investigation and potential mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| And I quote, as a result of federal financial assistance from the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| the district is subject to provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act 1964, Title VI-42 USC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| and is implementing Regulations 34 CFR Part 100, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2637)|

| 0:44:13| and approved a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, approving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding between and among the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2659)|

| 0:44:33| and entered into an agreement on July 1, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Therefore, the Knox County Commission, in partnership with the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| may be subject to findings of violation to the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| and its implementing regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| If the Knox County Commission approves the building contracts or proceeds with construction activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| prior to the findings provided by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| and or until a potential remuneration process is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2701)|

| 0:45:10| the Knoxville Branch NAACP respectfully yet strongly insists that the Knox County Commission decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160119?start=2710)|
