| 0:02:31| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=151)|

| 0:02:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Well, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| We really are going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| We have a fairly intense beer board agenda tonight, and early voting continues until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| We're going to race through the agenda so that those who haven't voted can go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| Before we start, we have a couple of announcements from the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| When I call your name, you need to come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| You need to speak into the microphone with your name and address very clearly so Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Johnson can get it written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Applicants, if your application is approved tonight, you can pick your permit up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| end of the meeting from Ms. Day and Ms. Dyer over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| If it's not approved because you probably have inspections to do and other things, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| you can get your permit from them when all that's completed at the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Beer Board members were theoretically saving trees, so let's continue on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Officer Crocker is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Sergeant Coward decided to get married, and so he told me he was going to be on his honeymoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| and he opted to not come back for a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| I was disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| You got married in lieu of a beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Officer Crocker, I know that you will just carry right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| The first case that we have tonight . . . Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| We did not approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=244)|

| 0:10:21| And I hope you find your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=621)|

| 0:10:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| James Broughton, 52 10th C, Schubert Road, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Officer Crocker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| We don't have Janet and James' background and fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| and we're missing the owner-manager application for Daniel Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Oh, gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I'm not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| I'll speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| I mean, you mentioned earlier about obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| My wife and I went and got our fingerprints and our background checked on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Once we found out we wasn't supposed to do that, it was too late to go through the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| We have that scheduled for Thursday morning of this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| and also I have Daniel's application here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| So if you all could give me a provisional approval perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| What we do is defer this to the next beer board meeting, which is September 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| So that will be when your case is heard again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| and everybody's prints and everything should be in place by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| So do I hear a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And we're going to defer this for 30 days so that you'll have time to get everything in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| August the, I'm sorry, September 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Next is Elkmont Exchange, and there are two permits here, one for manufacturing and distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| and the other one is for on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Let's do the manufacturing and distribution first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=725)|

| 0:12:08| Did you want the business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| It would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| 745 North Broadway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Officer Crocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| We need approvals from fire inspection, fire prevention, building inspection, and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Do I hear a move to approve pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| When do you think the manufacturing phase of this will be ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| We expect to have all those certifications early in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Now, we wrote it on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| What do we need in terms of incomplete records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| They're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| They were incomplete at one time, but we've got everything now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Oh, we've got it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Now we're going to do the on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Are you still the speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I'm going to pass it off here to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| JT DeWitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| I need the address also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| 745 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Officer Crocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| We need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Now, tell us about this because you've got a lot of pre-publicity, so expectations are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Well, it's Elkmont Exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| It's got a great, very eclectic menu, a lot of Tennessee root-based foods, some Vietnamese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| It kind of tells our stories about where the founders have come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| And, no, it's just going to be a great place to come with great beer, great food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| And you expect to open on what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Let's plan for, depending on all approvals, but planning sometime that middle to late September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Well, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Next is the Festival Burano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| My name is Fouad Reves, 115 South David Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Officer Crocker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| The applicant we have listed for the owner-manager at this time is DePaldo Casendanda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| who has not come in for the fingerprints, the background check, and the task requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| It's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We had a change on the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| And we had this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| It's the same one as P. Reyes, LLC, DBL Patron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| And he's the owner, but I'm the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| I have my task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And I think I've spoken to several folks in the committee as far as the misunderstanding that I had with my fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| and my background check, being that I had it done in February when I called KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| I was told that it's taken care of, that I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| I think what I was asking was, was my task form okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| And I took that as also my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I didn't realize it only lasts for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Mr. Frost, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| On the basis of that, since you don't have an up-to-date plan and your event is August the 19th, which is this Saturday, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=921)|
| 0:15:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| When we spoke on the phone last night, I suggested a way to address your need to serve beer was to get a caterer that's approved by TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=932)|
| 0:15:42| I think I gave you two or three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Ms. Day has other names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| There's a list, I think, of about 15 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And that will be the way for you to be able to serve beer at your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| So the person that's supposed to have the background check, is that Leopoldo Castaneda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| He's not connected to this anymore, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Do we have a background check on the person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| Not a recent one that would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| When was the most recent one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| He said February, so that's the most recent, and we need it within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| So February of 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| I just think we might want to consider that if the background check passed this pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| and then if the background check comes back the same as it was in February 2017, then he could get his permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| We won't get it by Saturday, and that's when his event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| It takes several days for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| You won't get it back by Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| So the chair's suggestion is they hire someone with their own license to come in and pour the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| This happened before to different groups, and they typically will hire a caterer who will come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and they're licensed and ready to pour, and it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| We're not involved in who you hire or whose beer you use or any of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| but it is a way for you to continue to have alcohol at this event that is this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| But may I ask in that we had, at least it was my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| that the application that you should have now is that as the manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| the only thing that I'm lacking is the background check, which the fingerprint's already at KPD, as my understanding is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| That's right, but it has to be within 30 days of the application, and yours is longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| It took place in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| This is August, and so that background check and records check are out of date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| and it is the policy of the beer board that it has to be within 30 days of the time you come to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Would there not be a possibility of the background check being given to you before Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| At least that's the impression that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| It won't be back from wherever you all send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| It won't be back from the people that check the background check for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| There's not enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| How long does a background check take typically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| It can take anywhere from two days to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| So if it's two days, I guess there would be a chance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| You can't wait until Friday to know if it's going to be back, if it doesn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| And also it's the policy of the beer board that it's the beer board that approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| not placing that burden on the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| And once we go down that path, then I don't know how we say no to anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| It's unfortunate that you're in this situation, but you're right up bumping up against your deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| and Mr. Castaneda didn't do it, and so we're stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| So hiring a caterer with a license at least gets you beer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| It might take a little out of your profit, but it's better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| You would still be able to serve beer at your event, just not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| It would be the caterer that would be having the beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Did you get an application with actually the right names on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| and we just don't have it in front of us, or you never got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| That's kind of two-part, too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| You don't have the background check, but you also don't have the right names that match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| They're in the additional information you were given tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| He came in, I think, yesterday to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| The difference here is that he's got it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I mean, you've got a beer permit and a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We have a beer permit right now in the restaurant in February that was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| and it's the same exact entity that is putting this festival together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| And we had that application in front of us somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I can dig through here and find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| You have the same application with his name on it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| That's where it makes it a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Slippery slope, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| It's slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I mean, that's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| He's got a beer permit in his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| in the same name that you're applying for for an off-premise special event permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| And you have the task classes up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| You had a background check done in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| and we had no time to get it back before the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| This is what we, after huddling with the attorney, have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| We need to postpone this event, or not event, but postpone the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Meanwhile, you need to find a caterer who will be able to come and serve beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| so you can proceed with your event on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Otherwise, we can't approve your application tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| because we don't have the current background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| Can his restaurant not cater this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| They're not licensed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| They're licensed by the state for liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| But they're not a licensed caterer by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| It's a separate permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| I don't think the Beer Board wants to deny this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| simply because it would be a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| he'd have to disclose it from here on now for the next ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| and it's not worthy of being denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So that's why he can withdraw it, or it can be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| and have essentially – I mean, because of the Beer Board's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Sort of like tabling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| I move we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Now, what this means, if we approve the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| that you need to get a caterer who is approved by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| and have them serve the beer so you can proceed with your event on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| But you can't serve the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Best we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Do I have a – I mean, do I have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| All those in favor of deferring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Do you want to tell us about the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Because I'm assuming you'll find a caterer and it will go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| There will be several Hispanic bands playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| and also a lot of Hispanic food will be served at the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| So that's the first year, which we hope will be several more to come in several other years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| And you know that in the future when you have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| get that stuff taken care of really in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| You've had a tough time with this, and I'm sorry, but it's the way the rules fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| I was just – like I said, we just realized it the last second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I was aware that it only lasts a month instead of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Well, good luck on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| At the World's Fair site on Henley Street, where are you going to actually do the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| At the World's Site Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1385)|

| 0:23:45| It's a fondue and martini bar at the old Baker Peters Jazz Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Well, I'm excited to see something coming back into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Well, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1434)|

| 0:24:02| Hopefully end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1444)|

| 0:24:10| Next is Matthew Miller with Good Golly Tamale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Matthew is a perfect example of being a one-person business and trying to get all this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1458)|

| 0:27:27| The first year we did in Jefferson County and it was an excellent turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Folks wanted more options with food and also wanted beer and that county has some challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1651)|

| 0:28:30| some of the mosaics and some of the windows that have been constructed already if we can do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1716)|

| 0:28:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1722)|

| 0:28:53| The mosaics are done in Italy and they're not completely done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Only we've got to do the dome and some of the other things around the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| So we hope to be done, unfortunately, kind of late next year at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1749)|

| 0:31:55| The same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| We're delayed due to construction, and I would seek a 60-day just to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| although we're hoping to hit September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1920)|

| 0:32:30| Do you need 60, 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| 90, if we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1951)|

| 0:32:43| The Fountain City Exxon is on here, but they should not have been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| They had asked for a 60-day, and we had a little clerical mix-up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| so we're going to have them come back in September like they had planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Next, we have Gieser Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1974)|

| 0:33:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| What's the delay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| We have a construction delay as well, and I would conservatively ask for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| To extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2004)|

| 0:33:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Next is Morelli's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We've been seeing Morelli's for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I think she's kind of uncomfortable about being back again, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| I think I need to join the beer board, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2022)|

| 0:33:53| Tell us what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Well, I'm looking at September 11th open date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| but I'm going to ask for a 60-day extension just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Move to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Well, I need to go get another background check, or I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Do you need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Well, because I've been here like 17 times now, and then I know I had to update it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| I think it was in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| She had hers in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| That's one of the fallacies of our rule right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I mean, another guy had his before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I thought she was back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I thought she came back in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| It was April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| So I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| It was extended at 60 days, so I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| She didn't have 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| But as far as I know, she's got hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| But is the ruling that we don't need to redo it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| She does not need to have it redone, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2089)|

| 0:34:51| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Next is Saltworks Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And this is for your Knoxville Center location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Tell me what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| We just got our permits to commence construction this morning, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| And so we're asking for a 90-day extension so that we can actually complete the construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| Move to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Are you going to retain that name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2116)|

| 0:35:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| And this is Monterey Corporation doing business as El Chico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Is there anyone here from that group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| If so, you need to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| While they're on their way, I'll remind the beer board that they were cited on April 26th for a sale to a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| That was the first in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| They sent a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| They were cited again on July 8th for a sale to a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| This was the second time in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Administrative hearing was sent notice on July 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| The hearing was received on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Remedial plan and $500 fine received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Tell us what's going on here that you had two of these violations in such a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Well, the second employee, the first one was a mistake for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| And then on the second one that we implemented, all the remedial plans that we had executed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| and the server just happened to not check anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Before we proceed, tell us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Name is Girish Desai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| It's 116 Cedar Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I am Alex Winston, Norton & Loon Law Firm, 310 North Forest Park, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2197)|
| 0:36:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Folks, this is their second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| How are we going to avoid this again, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Well, we're going to send them to an administrative hearing, I believe, and they will decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| What we would ask is that you accept the $500 fine and the revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| Do you guys have copies of that revised remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| As full remediation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| They've taken some additional steps that aren't in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| If I could have the opportunity, I'd like to go through a few of those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| You've got two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| They've terminated the employee who was responsible for the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| They did that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| They require all their employees to agree in writing at the beginning of every shift to check all IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| and they further agree that failure to do so will result in their immediate termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| They are requiring all employees to successfully complete a class and a tutorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| and take a test afterward on safe service of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| They're considering a small cash reward to employees who successfully pass a compliance check or confiscate a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2271)|
| 0:38:02| They've increased signage throughout the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| They require every ID to be checked, regardless of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| They're consulting with their point-of-sale software provider about how to stop servers from putting in a drink order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| without putting in an individual unique birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| So you do have a point-of-sale provider, and you're working to use that as the way to really check things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Software provider, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| On that, and then, of course, on a daily basis, we're using the ID checkpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Councilman De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| That was the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I was wondering what we had to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We can either send them to a hearing or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| We can either send them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Typically, we send them on the second citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| What is the status of their ability to serve at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| They can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| They can serve until the hearing decides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| All they've had so far is a fine, and they've submitted a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| I thought we typically accept it if we think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| Haven't we accepted a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Do we know our numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| They typically accept the first time, and the second time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| they go to the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Is that the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I didn't pull figures for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| The officer can accept these things, and it can end there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| The officer can impose a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| There are multiple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| This is twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| The thing that disturbs me is that April and then again in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| that's just a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| But they don't come before our board if it's just one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| They don't come before our board the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Very often we accept them without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Mostly we accept it when they have to come back again for a TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| If we've already dealt with it and TABC deals with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| then usually that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| TABC apparently has not dealt with this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Well, we've been in contact with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| and we're negotiating with them on a settlement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| We expect that to happen very soon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| He's been in contact with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| the inspections unit, the ABC, the Tennessee Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| He's talking to everybody he can to try to get ideas about how to cut this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| I mean, they're taking a very proactive approach and doing everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| So was it the same employee both times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| We can send this to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'm sorry, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Make that motion that we send it to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| And when you get to the administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| explain what you've done, what you're doing, what TABC is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| what you've come up with TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and there may be no further action or there may be further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| But they're operating and running until the hearing officer decides differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Anything else before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Let's adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170815?start=2474)|
