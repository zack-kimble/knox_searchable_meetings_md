| 0:04:48| well, but it was really neat to see just, you know, we were the only school system in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| the country of the 15 organizations that were recognized, so it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=293)|

| 0:05:15| tanks to the Ukraine to support, and that's part of his logistics job right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=315)|

| 0:05:53| is Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| If I could real quick, Jason, before you start, if that's okay, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| I just wanted to start by saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I'll let Jason talk in a second, but a couple things I just wanted to say first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So this is really a critical point for us as a district, and just want to remind folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| you know, when we took this on a couple months ago by asking, this is really what we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| to do as a staff and really brought that to the board at that time to really say, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| can we serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| And we mean success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=382)|

| 0:06:30| process, to the families from the different regions and the regional focus groups, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| also to our task force, who's done a great job professionally looking at that and bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| recommendations to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| I just wanted to say that we know that this work is hard, but we know that it's the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| And until all of our students are achieving at the level they need to and have those obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| removed, we'll continue to work on continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| And I just wanted to say about Mr. Myers before he gets started, I've known Jason for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I knew him first as a special education teacher and knew his commitment in the classroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| his commitment to making things happen for kids even at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| He was an early co-teacher that we had in design that we had at the school we were at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| just working on infusing algebra and English with a special ed teacher, teaching beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| a certified teacher, and just the ideas and the innovation that he brought to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And anticipating what he's going to share tonight can tell you that I personally couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| think of a better person to lead this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I know his heart, and I know it was two decades of work that he's put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| So looking forward to hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Reiswick, and thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| kind words, as always, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| No pressure at all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| I'm happy to share the interim report on special education with the group tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| As you'll recall, in February, Dr. Reiswick tasked me with conducting and leading a deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| dive into our policies and procedures and practices in student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Over the last couple of months, we've heard from our RTI team, and most recently, we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| from our special education task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Tonight, I'm going to be discussing special education and what I believe will be our path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| This should look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| This is the framework we've used to guide this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| For tonight's purposes, I want to draw your attention to the overlap between some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| input mechanisms and our capacity to start taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| This will be important as I start talking through some of the work we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| In student success, we believe that this work was too important just to sit and wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| we had gone through the full process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| So as we have gotten input, whether it was from our educator input portal or our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| focus groups or from the special education task force, we believe it was important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| immediately start taking steps to improve opportunities for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| So across those multiple inputs, we found a few themes, and that's what our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| topics will be today is immediate action steps that I'm proposing to fill the needs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| we've discovered across these input mechanisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| First, we want to improve our communication, frequency, quality, and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| You're going to hear me say all staff a lot tonight throughout this, and I want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| clear that my position on all staff is all staff, starting with me, the assistant superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| through our director of special education, through every level of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| So this is not just going to be something we're going to push down to schools without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| not first visiting our own capacity and our own willingness to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I believe that we lead from the front, and that's what I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| So anytime I say all, so I don't have to remind everybody what all means, all means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| for real all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Meeting the needs of students with disabilities is not just the obligation of the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| ed department or student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| They are our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| They are our students in Knox County, and it will take a willingness to change our mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| across the board to fully meet their needs and give them the best opportunity to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| So we're going to start with improving our communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| We're going to enhance our protocols and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| We're going to expand coaching and training for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| We should all be modeling continuous learning at every level in our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| The second we stop learning, we're dead in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| So again, all staff means all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Developing a student-first school-level decision-making strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| We have to get back into a position where the decisions are being made for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| by those who are working most closely with that student, and that is going to be a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| priority as we push this work forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Building our capacity for continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I want to be clear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Under my leadership, our pursuit of continuous improvement will never be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| There will never be a time where I sit in a meeting and be like, yeah, we've arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We're as good as we can ever be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| That time will never come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I felt that way when I started my career as a TA, and it's just as true today as an assistant superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| We will continually be seeking to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| And then finally, we want to improve our processes for collaborating with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Before I dive into this slide, I want to talk about why I'm committed to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| I've addressed the Board of Education over the years over countless topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Some of them, like I had to talk about bedbugs one time, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| I don't know a lot about bedbugs, just to be candid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| All the way to, you know, what's the difference between three feet and six feet for social distancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| And what's this mean if this person gets isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| And what are we going to do about this mask mandate and all these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| This is the first time I've ever had the opportunity to talk to the Board of Education about special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| And so for me, my commitment to this work is grounded in the fact that this is where I started my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| A lot of people rolled the dice on Jason Myers over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and the first person that did it rolled it on a 21-year-old version of myself and made me a teaching assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| And I thought it was the greatest job that I was ever going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| And the reason that I thought it was the greatest job I was ever going to have is I had this small group of kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| and my only job every day was to create opportunities for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| And I knew immediately that I loved it, and that's what I wanted to do with my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| So then I, in a very nontraditional way, became a special education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| And as Dr. Ryser referenced, I taught in all sorts of settings, both special ed and gen ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| And I was part of the first co-teaching cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| And I did help publish a presentation for the Council for Exceptional Children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| on how you can implement co-teaching as a successful model in an urban school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| And that was when I started to shift my mind not just to impacting the students directly under my supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| but how can I be a reformer? How can I create more opportunities for more students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| And at that point, I was given the opportunity to enter into school administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| and my first task didn't have, I mean, candidly, again, had no idea really what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| But my first task was to redesign a comprehensive high school into a small learning community school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| back before it was hip to do so, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| I've been a reformer my entire career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So when Dr. Ryser tasked me with this and he made his announcement on February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| I don't remember the exact words that he said to me in that meeting or that he said to the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| But what was clear to me is that he was calling me to use change as a lever for reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| which is something that I have done very successfully during the course of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| So my commitment before I enter into this slide is to attack this with the same energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| that I've attacked every other change initiative I've been a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| no different than the Region 5 way or redesigning a high school or taking over a special day school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| Any of the initiatives I've been part of have been what I wake up thinking about every single morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| So I am going to be committed to this work, and I am going to get my team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| and we're going to find a way to make Knox County Schools the model for special education in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| So in the next year, I intend to work with our special education department to develop systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| and structures to ensure decisions are made by those closest to the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| We're going to reimagine central office support because support should feel like support, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| So we want to reframe how we support our teachers, our students, and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I'm going to personally pulse check our systems by sitting in on IEP meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| and other meetings related to the IEP team process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We listed manifestation determination, but there are a lot of various ways that I can pulse check through meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| and also visiting classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We're going to listen to and collaborate with our families and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| So when I go and I sit in on an IEP team meeting, it is not going to be to sit there and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| well, this was a really good meeting or this wasn't a really good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| It's really going to be to have the opportunity to hear from the people on the ground what's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| Is the philosophy that we're trying to shift or the paradigms that we're trying to shift actually taking hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| down to the school level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Are we building capacity to make those decisions closest to the student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Because if we're not, then we need to change our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And again, as I said earlier, our work in student success will never be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| A little-known fact, our child find numbers have doubled since the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| Child find is the mechanism through which we identify kids with disabilities, for those who aren't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| But our work is never done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| We are never going to arrive, and we're going to remain committed to success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| and that's going to be core to our mission moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Again, we didn't want to just sit and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| First of all, it's not in my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Dr. Adams reminded me just before then how impatient I am, and it felt like he was saying it in a kind way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| But we haven't just sat and waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| We didn't sit and wait in Region 5, and we're not going to sit and wait now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| So we've taken action along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| One of the first things we did was we created and implemented a policy to allow private practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| to provide support to students in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| We established modification resources to enhance our inclusion practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We implemented a new process for monitoring and improving our LRE rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| and we improved our reading intervention supports for children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| And this is only the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Tonight, to back up my words, because at this point in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I understand the perception is mostly I'm a talking head for the district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Words don't mean a whole lot, but actions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| So tonight we're backing up our words with six specific action steps that we are going to take immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| and I'm going to ask the Board of Education for their support in the vote on Thursday for two of those action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| First, coming in January 24, because we do want to make sure that we're casting a wide net to get input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| we're going to launch the KCS way for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| If you get in your DeLorean back in time, you'll remember the Region 5 way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| The Region 5 way, that's our road map for how we're going to meet the needs of kids in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| The KCS way for special education will be the road map to establish high expectations for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Again, starting with me through every level of our organization to ensure that everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Again, I view this as the work of everyone, and for us to get better, we have to raise the bar for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| We're going to have clear customer service and communication guidelines for all staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| clear expectations on staff training, support, and professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| and hopefully culminating in an improved IEP experience for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| As part of this project, we're going to collaborate with the Office of the Ombudsman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and our special education family liaison to really help us dig in and find those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| to become more consistent in our communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| To enhance our protocols and practice, I'm asking the Board of Education to consider a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| to provide staffing support to our schools in the form of educational assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| and hard-to-staff service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I was really happy when I heard the task force make a recommendation around a staffing solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| I do think that we have to be forward-thinking in how we address these challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| What this contract doesn't do is it doesn't obligate us to any particular expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| over the course of the contract, nor does it obligate the other entity to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| fully staff us, so I don't want it to be conflated with the custodial contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| What this does is it gives us another tool to face the challenges around staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| and put us in a better position to make sure that students are getting their services in a timely way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and hopefully relieve some of the stress that our current staff are currently feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| by having to cover all these various spots where we're short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Expanded coaching and training for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Again, we saw this in our teacher input portal and from the special ed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| I'm committed to identifying outside partners to provide technical assistance in the following areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| staff training and professional development, inclusion, and behavioral supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Again, all, all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| We're all going to visit what our philosophies are in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| What is our why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Why do we believe inclusion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Like, we need to have those conversations and have some outside expertise to help us along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| In the development of a student-first school-level strategy for decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| it's going to be important for us to assess our existing systems and structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| so I'm launching an input portal for our school leaders and all teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| We've not yet heard from our school leaders, nor have we heard from our gen-ed colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And again, for us to be successful and have long-term sustainable change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| we need to hear those voices and see what gaps need to be closed from their perspectives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| So we're going to be launching that pronto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| I'll be asking the Board of Education for their support on this one as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| in an attempt to build greater capacity for continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I'm asking the Board to approve funding to hire a student success accountability officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| This position would report directly to the assistant superintendent of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| The goal would be to provide insight around legal trends, laws, and best practices in serving special pops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| So this would not be just in the realm of special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| but this person would also be guiding our work for English language learners, Section 504, bullying and harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| all the legal issues that are sort of housed in the Division of Student Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| This person would also collaborate directly with the assistant superintendent of student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| regarding any potential legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| And finally, collaborating with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I'm committing tonight to developing a framework for a council to provide insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| and lend perspective into our continuous improvement initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| This will be comprised of parents and caregivers of our students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| educators from the special ed side and the gen ed side, as well as KCS administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| I'm committing this council to be ongoing and meet on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| probably mirroring similar to what we do with our family councils in our regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| So as I wrap up, I want to just reinforce that I'm excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| to bring about change and reform to special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| But cultural change takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| We're a very large school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| This won't happen overnight, and it won't happen without commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| So I've talked about my commitment, and we're going to get after it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| as soon as we get through this board presentation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| We're going to get after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So change work is hard, but in KCS we've committed ourselves to doing the hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| So does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1332)|
| 0:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| I guess your presentation answered all of them, so there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| I would like to thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| I especially appreciate you sharing your commitment in the fly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| because I think as board members we have seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| But from the family standpoint, the community standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| that might have had less than desirable experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| they may not have seen that from the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and I do think it is important that people hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And also I would just like to note, because I know I've gotten a lot of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| and they've been very helpful, and I hope they keep coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| but this work isn't happening in a vacuum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I assume you're still coordinating all the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| and doing all your IEP team meetings and all those things in addition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| So it isn't going to happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| because we still have to continue to support our students and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| in the work that we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| So moving on to our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Let me dig it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I have a lot of papers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| Any questions on 5A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1430)|

| 0:26:30| We've got a lot of policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| I missed that policy reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Yeah, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| You might get through the alphabet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| S or T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| U or V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| W or X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Yes, Ms. Hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Regarding policy X homework, I was looking over it, and everything seems great, and I feel like that's something that all the students would definitely be on board with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| However, I was just wondering how such a policy could be implemented and enforced as, say, if a teacher wasn't complying with the policy, how is a student supposed to bring that up and have their problem fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1624)|
| 0:27:20| That's a great question, and Dr. Wilson is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| So, Dr. Reiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I think Dr. Wilson knew you were going to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| So, he didn't come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| So, yeah, I would have to look closer at the policy, but what I would suggest is to make sure I got the wording right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| But I would think, you know, first, always we try to start with a conversation with the teacher, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I mean, you probably don't bring the policy and say you're violating policy, but kind of have some kind of conversation just around, you know, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Sometimes I think students can also go to their parents to have that conversation because sometimes that's more of a conversation between a parent and a teacher that can happen then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| And then, ultimately, usually we see most things resolved at that level, but if not, you know, administration at the school could get involved, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| So, you know, most of the time I would think that it would probably be a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I could see it depending on the age of the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You might not want to go to have that conversation with the teacher and the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| You might want to have your parents do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| But I think some do have that relationship to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| And most of the time I think it could probably be resolved from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| There's, you know, just looking at some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| And, again, like a lot of these policies, sometimes there are times on a project due that might be more homework than, you know, in given times than there would be at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| But it's probably always better to start with that conversation, but ultimately probably get the school administration involved if there's two different viewpoints when that conversation happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1713)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| And just to follow up, do we communicate these out to the schools once they're approved, I assume, so that those communications can be made to the teachers and staff as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1724)|
| 0:28:55| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I actually don't have a question about X, but I couldn't find my note for policy N, but I did find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| So this is the one regarding organization for instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| On page 2, line 13, I'm wondering if there's an error there or if it's intended to say what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| So line 12 and 13, it says high schools and the 865 academies will have a freshman academy and sophomore career themed academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| But it's really sophomore through senior, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| So it just seems like it kind of cuts off there at sophomore, which it doesn't seem as expansive as it's intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Watson, once again, Dr. Wilson, I'll get another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| So I was not here for policy review, but my guess would be since this year it's only through sophomores that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| I don't know if the understanding was that they're going to roll it up every year to junior and senior as that moves on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| But then we're just updating the policy every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Could we not just say sophomore through senior now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I mean, that is the intent is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I see Ms. Jackson standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Would you like to speak to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Yeah, it may be intentional and I'm just not catching the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| We were what we were anticipating is that for this year, it would be true to say that we are in the academy model for ninth and tenth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| And that since we go through an annual policy review next year, it would be true for us to add the eleventh graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| And that that felt like the more accurate description for what we were saying for the current model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Was there anything else with that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| So anything else with N or X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| So moving on, Y or Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| A, A or B, B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| C, C or D, D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Oh, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| On policy D, D controversial issues on I think it's just a typo, but on page one, line 36 and page two, line one, it's the same typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1873)|
| 0:31:26| The word is C when it should be seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| We made that notation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Item E, E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Moving on to grant seven, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Could someone just briefly go through the details of the changes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| On A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Seven A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Seven A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, there are no changes to this amendment from the previous one that the board approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1928)|
| 0:32:24| So I guess the word addendum is kind of throwing me off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| So we are just continuing as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| We're following the timeline that the state requires for the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| We do anticipate some changes in the last year to the spend plan, but there aren't any at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| So item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| I or J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| Moving on to contracts eight, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Myers reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I was referencing the spend plan specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| We did update dates for meetings with the health department in this addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| So contracts item A, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Or C or C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| C2 or C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2050)|
| 0:34:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Mine is pretty different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Okay, so D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| I know you sent an email to the board relative to item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| First, let me just say I appreciate those emails where you give some clarity and some context to specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| That's really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| But I thought it would be good, since we talked a lot about the salary study, for you just to talk about that publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| and share anything that you want related to the addition of the classification study and what that hopefully will do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I'll actually have Ms. Himmelgaard speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| This is, I would say, support of this, because I think this is the way we do our salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I think it's kind of unique, and this was something that we found that would be, I think, beneficial to the full study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| So go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| This is an addition of a job class study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| So what Evergreen, the consultant, discovered in digging into our salary schedule and our position descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| is that we've got a lot of positions in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| So in addition to the salary schedule itself, we've got a lot of different positions that fit on that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| So the job class study addition compares salaries to job duties across different position titles in different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| So an example would be a supervisor in one department and a supervisor in another department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| They're paid on the same pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Are job duties comparable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| So looking at those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And with the addition of the classification study, we're still less than half what we had budgeted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Because we had budgeted around $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| It's an additional around $58,000, but still well under the $300,000 that we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| It comes in around $123,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I actually had the same question, so thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| But I also, and I appreciate that work that you guys are doing, Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| And I also just wanted to say, and Dr. Wilson's not here, but I'm really glad to see the contract with Junior Achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| And I think that's a great, great organization to utilize and hopefully be able to pull in some community support also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| So kudos for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| So any discussion on item F, 8F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Did you say item F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Mr. Myers, one, thank you for the passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I mean, you have been in front of the board a lot when I've been on the board, and that was definitely the most passionate you've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| I really appreciate you kind of cracking yourself open a little bit and letting us know where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| And I think it's evident in the work that you guys are putting forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Can you go a little bit deeper into the South Central LLC contract for special education staff support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| And you talked about how you're not seeing it in the same way as what we're doing with custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| But can you tell us what the intent of it is and what you hope it will help us do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Thanks, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Yeah, you know, in terms of the particulars of the contract and the who's and the what's and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| I would probably defer to my colleague, Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| But the why is to make sure that we can get students the services they need in a way that is timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| so that we're not in a position where we're having to deliver services during extended school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| to remediate some of the lack of services during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| It puts us in a stronger position to meet the needs of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And I think where I see this as different is neither party is committing to anything other than this is an additional tool for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| So we're not coming into this contract saying we're going to spend a million dollars with this company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| and they're going to fill all of our vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| This is just to give us another tool to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And I think in terms of the need, which is where I kind of live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| so I referenced in the presentation that our child fine numbers had nearly doubled since 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| And we've added positions in every budget cycle to the school psych department since back when I was the executive director until this last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| Whether it's school psychs or diagnosticians, if you name it, we've added it to try and keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| We're currently down five psych positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| And I talk about child fine because that's a really easy, tangible thing because we monitor that number very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| But in the grand scheme of things, that's actually not even entirely the role of our school psychs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| As you start thinking about the demands that are placed on them as it relates to conducting manifestation determinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| whether it's about student behavior or it's about attendance or it's doing 504 or participating in 504 evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| They are a system that has been essentially overrun because we can't find enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| When I look at the SLPs and the number of hours that our SLPs are being asked to deliver on has increased by a little more than a thousand more hours compared to the 1920 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2371)|
| 0:39:46| So when we start thinking about what might have the impact been for schools not to be open for a while, what might those lasting effects be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| From a special ed perspective, and we start thinking about some of these young folks coming into the school system, I think we're starting very much to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| So for SLP perspective, we're down three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| But what that represents is eight schools who don't have a specifically assigned SLP, which means our, back to the burden on our current staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| that means our existing SLPs are dividing their time even more so that they can go and try to provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| So to me, the why is we've got to try something because I've been in special ed, as I referenced earlier, for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2423)|
| 0:40:33| And when I came to Knox County, I benefited from things like signing bonuses for tough-to-staff positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| We still have that practice in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| Some of our educational assistants are eligible for stipends and supplements and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| This is just a really complex one, and I think that to solve issues in the current job market, I think we have to think about the solutions a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| And I think that the more tools that we can have in our toolbox to address these shortages, the better off we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| I think this contract is also unique in that it includes the potential to be able to capture more educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| And for reference, we have 60 vacancies in our TAs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| The person at her desk has a request from the special ed department to add 11 more to try and support the work we're doing around inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| And for all intents and purposes, there are no applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| So if you're listening and you would like to be a TA, hit us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| This contract doesn't give up our obligation to go out and recruit people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| It just gives us an additional tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| I'm just trying to understand how the tool works. I don't think it's about making it easier for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| But the ESS South Central LLC, do they already have people with these credentials on their staff that they would place with us, or are they just head hunting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Are they another group that's helping get people that will come through a pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| And I'm going to have Jennifer address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, that was my answer. It's a little bit of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Do they currently have on staff the amount of people to fill all of our 63 SPED educational assistant vacancies and the school psychologists and SLPs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| I'm not sure that they do with the specialized area, the school psychs and the SLPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| But like Mr. Meyer said, it is another tool to work towards filling those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| Correct. And like Mr. Meyer said, we will not stop recruiting for these positions as well and attempting to fill them with KCS employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| It doesn't necessarily matter, but I'm curious because I've never heard of them. Are they local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Yes. They have a local office, but they are not only local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| And what are the people that are already on their staff, do they do any direct service themselves or are they placed with other companies all over the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| I would have to get more information from them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I guess what I'm curious is are they more of a pass-through company where it's not a direct service provider or are they providing direct services, but they also have additional staff that they can essentially loan out, I guess, to other companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| We can get more information. I don't know that I have the answer to those specifically, and I think that the answer may be different for the different specialties, so the school psychs and speech-language paths versus the educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2608)|
| 0:43:46| I can see if Mr. Bolden has those specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| Ms. Himelgaard, will the employees be our employees or their employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| They'll be their employees. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| All right. Any other questions or discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| Moving to regular agenda items, item 9A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm sorry, but I was wanting to ask, as you all use acronyms, SLP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| Speech-language pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| Okay. I heard SLP about 57 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Yeah. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you. I just hope I wasn't the only one who didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| All right. So item 9, regular agenda items A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2704)|
| 0:45:14| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| I appreciate Mr. Myers asking for the position in D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| I do have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| And the main concern is that when I look historically at things that have happened in Knox County schools, what I see is that groups of parents bring us an issue and bring us a proposed solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| And it seems that we always adopt that solution in a little different way than the way it is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2752)|
| 0:46:02| And it always seems to be a way that is less helpful than intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| An example would be when our DEO committee suggested that we have ombudspersons for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2769)|
| 0:46:21| And for general education, it was suggested that the ombudsman be a position that was outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| So that that person was not under the direct supervision of the same people that the ombudsman was supposed to be potentially challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| And that seems to be the same recommendation that has come from the current committee, is the recommendation is for someone outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2797)|
| 0:46:54| And in each of these instances, and in other instances that I've watched over time, what tends to happen is that we bring in a group of people that are outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2814)|
| 0:47:06| And we bring in this position and it starts out as a position that is working for correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2826)|
| 0:47:16| But eventually it becomes a position that is just sort of absorbed into the bureaucracy so that it isn't really effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2836)|
| 0:47:27| And I'm trying to do it really diplomatically but the words that I have are not very diplomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| What begins as really genuinely supportive position eventually rolls into something that becomes more of a covering position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2857)|
| 0:47:56| Because it's not outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| It's not a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| When we have more people who answer to the people who seem to be part of the issues, that's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2888)|
| 0:48:18| If we're looking for accountability, we need to be looking for some outside accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| The reasons that we're looking at this position very much seem to be the same reasons that we were looking at an ombudsperson when we first brought that position in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2905)|
| 0:48:36| And if that position were working, I don't think this would be the same recommendation that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| So that's my concern. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you, Madam Chair. One, I appreciate being able to see the job description in advance and read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| I didn't have any questions about this, but I'm trying to listen to Miss Owen and trying to understand what the dynamics could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2941)|
| 0:49:12| And I don't have as much history on the board as she does for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| in that when you have somebody who's completely outside of a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| and it's hard to get that person's attention when you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| It's also, they're kind of always playing that consultant role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| They can't really have eyes on as much as they need to when they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| So I think that's one downside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| But also, too, I understand in a system that depending on who you answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| over time, whether or not that person that you're answering to wants you to behave in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| sometimes you just end up behaving that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| and you end up telling people what you feel like they want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Now, obviously, this person, their ethics, based upon the experience that we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and their background and all that, should prevent them from doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| and they should be willing to say the hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I mean, that's what we're basically asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| But I'm wondering if there was thought about this person directly answering to Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| And that's nothing against Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I'm just wondering if this is somebody who's supposed to put the ultimate check on one of our core four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3020)|
| 0:50:29| like they're the one, like they're the one who's constantly holding up the mirror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| And what we've said, and this is no fault of the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| it's just the way the law department in Knox County and with Knox County Schools is structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| is that sometimes it's hard to both be the one that's defending us but also holding up the mirror too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| We're saying this is what we want this person doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, if I was in your seat, I mean, ultimately, I would want them to hold that mirror up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| So I'm wondering if there was thought or conversation about that person directly answering to you instead of to Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| Madam Chair, thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| A lot of thought went into thinking through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| And, you know, for us, I think it becomes a matter of expertise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| We had great meetings with the law department, with David Buch and with Mike Moyers and with Gary Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| kind of talking through just what you said, defining roles and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| And we really left there with a great consensus of kind of where things were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| It was really clear from the end of our conversation that decisions to go to litigation or not rest in the superintendent's decision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| And so we all met that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, I think we kind of walked in not knowing where we'd be, and we all kind of quickly were like, yeah, that's how it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| So then agreeing that and taking that responsibility for me or whoever's in the seat down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| then comes the level of expertise that I would need and or my team would need in order to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| So there is a portion of this job that's accountability to make sure we're fulfilling all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| but there's also a piece that talks about when a situation arises, the ability to, you know, look horizontally at other groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| other people to see what kind of best practices and trends are happening out there so we can make a better decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| And then exactly as you said, if it's something that we say, yeah, we feel good about going to litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| we then work with the law department because they will be representing us when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| I think we thought a lot about this kind of like the way the Title IX, and I know that's driven by state law now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| but Chekovia, who's on our team as a Title IX expert, worked at a university level to see that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| really brought to us an expertise level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| We all had opinions, right, on, you know, this should be done or that should be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| and we work as a team with Ryan Brown and with facilities, and Gary's part of that team too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| But ultimately we didn't have somebody who that's what they were trained to do and had done that in the field, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| So for us it's really more about building that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| And so the way those decisions will be made, whether we move forward or not, will be with me and Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| So I need Jason's expertise to help me as an advisor as well as I do all the assistant superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So there won't be a decision made that I won't be making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| It's just there's some of those things that are kind of day-to-day things that Jason has knowledge of already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| We meet weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| We have scheduled one-on-ones, and he brings those things to me and says, here's where we are with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| and, you know, here's what we think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We think that person's that other voice to be able to say, you know, what are they doing in Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| What are they doing in someplace else too that might be a practice or we can look at that way to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| So even if it were reported to me, I would be bringing Jason into that conversation, and ultimately it's my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| Yeah, I guess that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I mean, I get the why, and I totally appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| And I would think that you would make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| So if even a person that answers to you can still advise another department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| so I guess can you just summarize the why not answer to you directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| You know, there are pieces of that too that, like when it goes to litigation, obviously I would be involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| But there are some just basic pieces and ideas that, you know, Jason's charged to run in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| So I think he would use that person as well to kind of look through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| And, you know, there may be stuff that's not litigation that comes to me that they're just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| I mean, he's done a good job laying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Tonight I feel that, you know, we understand school or families' experience with the special ed departments, that IEP meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| That's where they get, just like we say, a regular or general ed or all students is kind of what happens in that car line, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| But an IEP is a unique experience for them to have a look at the special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| He's going to be working to re-drive that whole culture with that being the centerpiece and building all our structures and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| I think this person will be a great help to them as well, looking at those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| So although I might be involved in the litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| there's probably 50% of the other parts of the job that he'll be doing with them on day in, day out to work through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| When it comes to litigation or not, then that's when I think we'd be brought in, or I'd be brought into those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| Jason does a good job keeping me abreast of that right now when it comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| But really, I think it's something I feel he can manage and they can manage because some of the jobs won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Every day, it's not going to be a litigation question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| There's going to be a lot of other countervails he's talked about with ELL and with RTI implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| and those kinds of things that will be conversations that I won't necessarily need to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| So I think it's a better fit for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| I'll just echo real quick what Dr. Rysluk said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I did sit in with that meeting with Mr. Dupler and David Buick about this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| Like Gary, I think we all went in wondering how it was going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| because we really weren't sure where everyone was, especially right after the recommendations came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| But I left feeling really good about it in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I felt like, and I'll even add that a situation came up at the end of last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| that I had to reach out to Jason about, and it was kind of an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| But I was thinking at that time, well, would it be helpful to have this person, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3373)|
| 0:56:22| to be able to ask this question to because I had some legal questions about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| and just questions about our practices and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| And I guess in my mind I was seeing that being a good situation to have that person on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| that I could directly reach out to along with Jason about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It seems like that with the limitations we have with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| that this would be a good compromise to satisfy and keep us within the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| and satisfy the need and the additional eyes so that it is two different perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| that are looking at what the law department typically sees and then just from the other perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3428)|
| 0:57:16| and that it really would come down to the perspective of this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and the expertise that this person brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| So I would assume that that was a big part of the conversation is the limitation that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| that this board has due to our Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Would that be, is that fair to say, Mr. Dupler, if you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| But, I mean, to me this just seemed like a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| because it kind of satisfies the need on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Ms. Horn, I don't know that I would call it a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| What the conversation was about was if the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| if Dr. Ryswyk and him making the recommendation to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| and the board would like to hire an individual with these qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Dr. Ryswyk indicated that he's been wanting to make some changes in this area for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| and this was all part of the progression of working on those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| And our response was that our role is to advise when the board needs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| when the administration needs it, and to litigate if it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| Another thing that was discussed was that of the interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| with special ed education children and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| the vast, vast majority do not end up in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| So, you know, I think that's probably one of the most, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| one of the highest reasons that the board may want to employ an individual like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| is to monitor all these other interactions that the law department would not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| you know, an interaction with to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| And without, as you indicated, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| there's a lot of attorney-client privilege and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| but I mean I think in general that's what I could relay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| And I'll just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Part of my conversation and concerns were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| when we go to people in the law department with issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| being the people that defend us, they are looking through this at a lens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| is this legally defendable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| You know, can we defend this in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And from my perspective, I don't feel like everything needs to go that far, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| I feel like there's a whole other layer we need to be looking at first, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| is where I was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I want to be clear that I'm not speaking necessarily against the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| I'm speaking against the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And in looking at the structure, I'm not looking at Dr. Roswick or Jason Miner's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| What I'm looking at is the overall structure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| does this person have the freedom to say what they need to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| If I were sitting here right now as an employee of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| I might not feel free to say what I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| I might not feel free to critique completely honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| When I'm talking to the person who has the ultimate ability to fire everyone in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| I might not say exactly what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Sitting here in my position now, I can say exactly what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| because no one in this room can fire me for saying what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| I can make people mad, but you can't fire me for saying what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| It's very different if my position is specifically to tell you what I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| and I may not feel that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| And that has nothing to do with who is in administration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| We don't know who will be in administration in the future and how that could play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| If we are looking at adding a position specifically to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| that the needs of students are being considered appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| that position needs to have some oversight from somewhere besides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| the people that they are supposed to be critiquing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| So that's my issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| However, I want to point out something else that's somewhat important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| A couple months ago, we were looking at policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| and at that time we had a policy that said that this board was to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| all new supervisory and administrative positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| And we threw away that policy, and instead we have a job descriptions policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| that now says the board shall approve the broad purpose and function of each position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| as recommended by the director of schools through the approval of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| and in accordance with state law, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| So we created a policy that I talked about at the time being constraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| It says that we shall approve the function of each position in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| It's not budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| So that's an issue as well, is that we have created a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| that doesn't really allow us to do what we're being asked to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I want to be clear, too, that I'm all for the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| and even though Ms. Owen's comments made me think about my potential concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| it's a different concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And the title that's being presented is student success accountability officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| and Mr. Meyer's title is superintendent of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| So if the student success accountability officer is supposed to hold that department accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| it's very hard to do that if you answer to the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I would be saying this no matter who's sitting in Jason's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| This is not about Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| It doesn't matter who's sitting in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| But to me, the function of that position is to help hold that department accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| to everything that we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| They would need to ultimately answer to you, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| And, you know, ultimately, Dr. Roswig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| I don't feel like it's my role as a board member to get in the weeds about how you structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| the organizational hierarchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| I just think it's something to consider because I do think, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| I've been in situations where people don't always want to say something to their direct report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| And if you're calling this person a student success accountability officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| they should know that's part of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| But they would need to know, there would have to be some way that they need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| they can jump over Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| They should feel like they can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| that they should be able to do that and go directly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Because if they don't, and again, this is not about Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It doesn't matter who's sitting in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| If the person at the top, Jason said earlier in this presentation about leading from the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| if something's broken at the front, and this person's there to help point it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| but he's answering to the person who's at the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| do you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| That's difficult, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I think it could be difficult, depending on the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| Ms. Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Related to this job description and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| my questions are a little bit different than I see in concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| I see education experience qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and we just heard Mr. Myers give a very compelling speech about his experience with all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| But what I don't see in the job experience is that they would also have any on-the-job experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| in working in special education and directly with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| It would be my fear that while they have gone to law school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| or potentially five years of experience with legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| and it says related to special populations, that seems a little vague to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| I would be concerned that this is a person that's just going to make sure that we're meeting the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| and not exceeding the law, and that's one of my big concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| One, who's handling this position now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| I mean, who's doing that work now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Madam Chair, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| So I think it's Dr. Loy and the Executive Director of Special Education for that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3987)|
| 1:06:39| We have other folks in ELL, also in RTI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| I like to run those, Alicia Jones and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| They all work, obviously, with Jason as well, looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| As Mr. Dupre has laid out, there is consultation for advice from the law department in some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| And, you know, I think, again, I get the good fortune of working with everybody in this district office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| and I know how hard they work for kids every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I think sometimes over time things happen and probably people get close and things like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| and I think it was a good time for us to kind of reset some of the roles with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Everyone who's been involved in those things has been, again, kids first, looking to do those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| But I think it's a time for our staff to be able to take a look at that and really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| before we move into things like litigation and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| us to have kind of formed our own idea and direction that we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| So I would say currently it's kind of a team effort working with the law department on advice on some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| as Ms. Christie said, whether this is legal or not or whether this is doable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| I think what you heard from Mr. Myers today is a commitment to go beyond just what's legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| but to go, you know, beyond to see what's best for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| And we feel like there's need for some of that legal expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| We always say all the special ed directors are kind of pseudo lawyers like on the side for what they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| but we don't have that level of someone who has that ability to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| When you take someone like Karen Loy in her job, she's managing all the IEPs and child fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| and her supervisors are working on all that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| This would be someone who could be that expert on the team that would have time to look at trends and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| would also be able to look at kind of what's out there legally, look at some of the pieces of that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| so that when we do go to the law department, we feel pretty set in where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| and then they can advise us moving forward into court or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| So I think it's just a slight shift on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I don't know, Mr. Myers, if you would add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| No, I think you have captured it kind of perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I think that, you know, and what I would say is in this job description, we mentioned the five years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4128)|
| 1:08:57| We're really going to be looking for people that have a balance of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| We would like to have the JD degree, but really we're also interested in that practical experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| because it has become clear tonight that I'm not particularly skilled at naming jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| but the job description, I think, gets more to what that person's role really would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| and it's more of an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| It's more of putting us in a position to be able to put more resources toward executing the mission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| So it gives us that legal expertise in-house so that it's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| I've had a very positive working relationship with the law department during my time in central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| and I have no doubt that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| But a little-known fact is that they don't actually spend all of their time giving school system legal advice, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| And so, you know, in terms of our efficiency and agility in the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| it would be ideal to have that expertise in-house and to help us in that advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| And as we think about re-envisioning where we're going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| how we might want to move forward in some of these areas, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| it's adding greater capacity to our team to make some of these choices as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| and hopefully lives a little bit more in the gray area, because I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| a good lawyer is just going to give you the black and white letter of the law answer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| So a person that has that balance between practical experience and letter of the law experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| I think, puts us in a better position to not always have everything be one way or the absolute other, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| It puts us in a position where we can go to, again, try to go above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| and, you know, hopefully put ourselves in a position where we're asking better questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Like, it's not a very pleasant question to be like, do you think we should or shouldn't, you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Like, let's really dig into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| This person digging into best practices in other states, other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| like that part of the role is far more interesting to me than them saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| yeah, we probably should do this or shouldn't do that based on this sentence and that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| Like, I would much rather have the innovation side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| and I think that's where the practical experience in the job description gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| And then my follow-up, Jason, to that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| how do you create a culture where somebody that is working for you can also hold you accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| and incentivize, really, you want to incentivize them to hold you accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| I really want to foster that culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| You know, and to Ms. Owen's point, it won't always be, you know, Jason Myers and John Ryswick, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| And so, you know, I think that Dr. Ryswick, you know, again, lead from the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| I think that he's put a lot of work into developing a culture of openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| And I think that, honestly, this process for improving student success is a testament to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| Like, we're all hearing, in some cases, some hard things to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| You know, and I would say the same thing of the commitment we made in the work in Region 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| and engaging with the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Like, we had to take a hard look at ourselves, a hard look at the work we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| and it's not an indictment on the work of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| It's more about shifting our focus forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| And I think that, you know, as we think about the kind of culture that we want to build in KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| and I know the kind of culture that I want to build in student success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| I don't think that there's anyone on the third floor that would be scared to walk into my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| and be like, Jason, you know, I don't agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Like, that's not the culture that I'm trying to build in student success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| and I know it's not the kind of culture that Dr. Ryswick's trying to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| It's not about right and wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| It's about the best idea winning, and that's the culture that we're trying to build in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| I'm approaching this with some hesitation simply because I'm thinking that I have a lot of these thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| that I agree with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| But one of the things when we did the DOE disparities on education outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| I was the one who suggested the ombudsman's program because I served as an ombudsman for long-term care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| for about nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| And I worked for the Council of Governments and went into long-term care facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| to ensure residents' rights were being respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| And because I was outside of an entity that had any control over what I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| I did have more autonomy and less pressure from the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4415)|
| 1:13:44| When we suggested the ombudsman program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| we were looking at it in such a way that that person could be outside of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| the power aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| But after discussing the structure, they had to work for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| Couldn't work for the board because the board's only employee is the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| And so if they worked for the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| then that superintendent would have to supervise that person along with the other folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| So it ended up being in a position that is somewhat affects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| negatively affects the way that the ombudsman can really navigate as an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| because the ombudsman is primarily an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| That's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| They answer complaints from our customers, in this case it would be parents and students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| and then they go and try to resolve the issue so that it doesn't go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| it is resolved for the student to go any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| But if need be, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| As I read the title, I did see that as an ombudsman type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4491)|
| 1:15:00| But as I look at the job description, it looks like this person is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| if they were the ombudsman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| the job duties would be that they would be really expecting themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Because they're the ones who are responsible for making sure that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| when I look at it, develop and refine a systematic procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| Those are things that a worker does, not an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| So it looks like this is someone who would work within a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| So I'm not sure if we're looking at someone who would be an ombudsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| You're looking at someone who would be advising whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| what do we need to do, if I can just speak plainly, what do we do so we don't get sued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| What do we do so we can make sure we meet the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| And what do we do to make sure that we're meeting the needs of all of our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And that person is, what I'm hearing, with everybody you have working now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| you don't have that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| So you need someone who has that expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| and also someone, just speaking plainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| to have the guts to tell you what you need to hear, whether you want to hear it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| And if you have someone, no matter where you place them at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| if you have someone who doesn't have those guts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| then they're not going to be able to do the job, simply because no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| they have pressure from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| The other thing is, is that I do agree with Ms. Byke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| that we have to have someone who knows special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| someone who has the passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I've seen that thing with Jason Myers with a law degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| But I think that that's essential, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| So we may need to look at what we want to call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| to ensure that it meets what the guidelines are calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| I just don't think we're looking for an ombudsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| This does not look like an ombudsman position to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| But on the other hand, I think we do need to have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| who has the ability to say, this is not going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| someone who's going to answer to this counsel that you're putting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| and the counsel can feel confident this person is working for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| That's why I hesitate to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| I don't have any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I just have some thoughts about it, in that I do think that this is a needed position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| I'm not sure about if all of this is making sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| It may need some more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| The other thing is, I did have a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| I see there was $134,000 that was being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| I didn't see the fiscal note of how did that work with what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| Is that budgeted somewhere, or is that something that's going to change the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Because I think Ms. Owens has a finger on the pulse of how does this affect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| in terms of changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| Ms. Similorn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Yes, Madam Chair, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| It would be a position that is paid according to our salary schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| and that it would be an unbudgeted position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| So it is not currently budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| And the $134,000 includes benefits as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| so the total cost for the position, not just the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Dr. Roswick, I may be misremembering, but in the email that you sent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| you did say that it would be paid for through unrealized savings in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| Was that basically what you had commented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| And I know Ron's here, and so is Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| We need to explain how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Yeah, typically everything budgeted in those items doesn't, you know, it's a large budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| And so usually there's savings found within that for us to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| But it is not, as Ms. Himelgarn said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| it's not currently a budgeted position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| We brought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4740)|
| 1:19:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| So is there any more discussion on Item D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| And quite honestly, this is still a challenge for me when we have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| and I know we vote on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| But is there a way, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| that we look at the title versus the job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| and looking at it from the perspective of is this the right title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| or is that the right job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| or are we just because I think there is some confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| And the other thing is, and I will say this is my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| I think if they answer to Mr. Myers or they answer to Dr. Rizek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| they're still answering to the powers that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| So I think if that person is doing that job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| they should be answering to one of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| But if they're doing the student success accountability officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| maybe that won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| Yeah, no, I'm more than happy to revisit the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| I think this was like the sixth or seventh name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| And so I can't remember them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| I don't have an itemized list, but we'll definitely go back and revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| And another point of clarity, and Corey may want to weigh on this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| but the designation of where that ombudsman sort of task for special ed lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| actually doesn't report to me anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| It reports to Corey and the strategy department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| So our family liaison for special ed in our ombudsman's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| were actually moved into Ms. Lautner's division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| So the person who's sort of the first line for family contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| whether it's because they want to brag about something great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| or maybe they have some concerns, is no longer in my reporting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| So that position is outside of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Dr. Rizek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| If I could add one thing real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Mr. Reverend, I think you did a good job explaining the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| And the first job that you were explaining, to Mr. Meyer's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| that family liaison does live within the ombuds office now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| So if families just have issues and or, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| celebrations that they want to share, that is not tied straight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| So we can work through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I think your description was correct with what we were trying to get done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| It's really that expertise on the legal side as we go about making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| or where we want to go about making changes to practices and structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| and those kinds of things so that we can serve better based on the input that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| It's not, as we're looking at, meant to be, and I will say this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| Jason did a good job describing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Ultimately, I'm the person who's accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| So whatever happens, whatever this person advises or Mr. Meyer's advises, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| And I'm the guy you can let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| So ultimately, I'm the guy who has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| So no matter where we put this person, it's still me that you guys hold responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| So I do think, though, ultimately the goal is that they would be kind of advisement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| looking at best practices, looking at some of those legal pieces of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| And I do think he's done a good job showing that that liaison is still there for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| who reach out with needs for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| And, Madam Chair, I think I may have a couple of more seconds left of my ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| But so the question that Ms. Bike asked is still stuck in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| Is there a need for the job experience to include working with special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4972)|
| 1:23:03| or working with parents or students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Because it seemed like that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| That is more if it was just an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| But that is more of a factor, I think, in that person being able to do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| So initially, when we started walking through trying to design this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| we really were more heavily focused on the IDEA Section 504 component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| But when we look at the division more globally, there are a number of legal factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| that play into each department under my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| For example, school culture deals a lot with student bullying and harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| And there's a lot of law around that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| So we wanted to kind of cast a broader net so that the language of using special populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| means that I want someone who has that experience working in the ELL realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| working in the IDEA realm, somebody who has a more global experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| working with that diverse group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Because there's a broad range of legal ramifications for all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5045)|
| 1:24:16| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| I agree that I think that those things are really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| but I think also understanding the experience of the process of what that's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| for families to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| I think either if you've been an advocate or you have worked in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| and worked with those children, I think that that's a really important experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| to have that would add to this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| I would imagine that your experience walking through all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| is very important in adding to your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| And I wonder if there's any way to incorporate something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| I get that you don't want to limit it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| I totally understand that, but I think it's a little more open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| And I think also where it says having essentially gone to law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| is that also going to include maybe being a member of the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| Or is it just having gone to law school and having a degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| This is another thing that we went back and forth on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Again, where I landed was to prioritize some degree of practical experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| To your point earlier, a lot of practical experience dictates the decisions I make every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| So I really value people who bring that to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| So when we loosen that requirement, I think initially in our first draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| a JD was absolutely the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| And so we tried to loosen some of those restrictions to be able to bring folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| that maybe have some more of that practical experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| versus just, hey, I've got the JD degree, hire me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| Will you also potentially look at any sort of auditing experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| and their ability to lead meetings and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| Because I think that those are skills that might be in here and maybe I just missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| I see that there's oral skills, written skills, communication skills, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| But I think if you were going to come in and maybe bring you recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| that you would also need that skill set and confidence to be able to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5191)|
| 1:26:40| I'll try to answer some of that, Ms. Byte, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I know we're focused in on this job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| but I also want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Myers said in the more global piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| So I don't want us to think this person is going to be like sitting in a room making decisions, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| and then calling Jason saying, here's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| He's talked about the parent council that will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| He's got people in the field as well and his teachers, his principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| He talked about a council that's going to include gen ed teachers who are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| So I think ultimately all of those are voices in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| This person, hopefully, will bring an expertise on legal side and legal practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| So there will still be plenty of place for the voice for the practitioner and for the supervisors and for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| So I just want to make sure I'm broad enough that we're not just going to rely on this person for a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| as we've seen through this process, have multiple input points and multiple conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| help us make a better decision, and I think that person could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| So if they do end up having a JD and they're more versed in law than they are in practical experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| or have more practical experience with a little law experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| our goal is to have those multiple avenues to be able to inform ultimately Mr. Myers and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| in making some of those decisions that we need to culturally do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| Yeah, and I think also it's important to note that we need the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| I mean, we want someone that is family friendly, that works well with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5282)|
| 1:28:10| And I do think that when you start putting a lot of these things in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| you start kind of limiting your candidate pool if you have a bunch of requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5295)|
| 1:28:22| whereas you might limit it to a certain group and there might be a rock star outside of that group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| that didn't meet that one criteria you placed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| So I would be hesitant to put too much in there personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5313)|
| 1:28:41| All right. Is there any more on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| All right. So moving on to item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Item F. Ms. Sullen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you, Madam Chair. I think I have legal questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| If we suspend these procurement regulations, then are we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5343)|
| 1:29:14| Okay. Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| I don't really know how to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| So in our duties and powers in law, we are required to either have procurement policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5361)|
| 1:29:31| or to follow the county's procurement policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| So when I look at that, it says that if we choose not to follow the county's procurement policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| then we have to do these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| So it looks to me like suspending this suspends our acceptance of the procurement in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5385)|
| 1:29:56| and makes it a more difficult process because now we have to have three competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| It looks like it would make the process more complex instead of easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| Mr. Diepler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| Well, thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I'd be happy to talk about it, and I can talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| but I see that Matt Myers is here from the head of procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| So, I mean, since he and his department brought about this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| I mean, I think he would be the best to address it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| and then I can certainly fill in any blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5435)|
| 1:30:44| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board, I'm Matt Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Director of Procurement for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| Ms. Owen, what we're doing is suspending two sections within the procurement regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| I think they may be listed in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Terry, I'm not sure if they got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| There's just two sections where we are suspending these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| All other commodities, services remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| We're only suspending vehicles just due to the nature in trying to procure those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| If anybody else has been to buy a car lately, it's a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5473)|
| 1:31:21| So that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| We're just suspending these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| If there's money in the budget and there's a vehicle that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| hopefully we can have it done within 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I can't wait 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I can't wait a week for quotes or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| It's got to be faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| The vehicles will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| So this is not at all us suspending these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| This is you suspending these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| So we are still under Knox County procurement procedures then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| One of my favorite people, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Mr. DuPort, did you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| I knew Matt would be able to say it better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| but the blank that I would fill in is that if the board passes this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| and it's going to go through County Commission as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| but if this is passed, then what administration would need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| and I've already talked to Dr. Adams about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| is would need to bring forth a list of general description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| of what the different departments would need as far as vehicles so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| the board can then say, yes, we're going to buy 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| I'm just making things up, 10 vehicles in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| And, you know, that way Dr. Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| and his people can go out and buy those vehicles and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Madam Chair, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| I just first want to publicly thank Matt, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| for doing this for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| And we do have that list of vehicles for every department for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| As you know, by the time we go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| those vehicles are already bought or whatever they're doing in other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| So we greatly appreciate your efforts to ensure that we have the necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| vehicles that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| So is there any more discussion on item F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Moving on to item G, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| So last month I mentioned that I was bringing a resolution to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| and I will say this was the work of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| So I want to thank everybody who helped craft this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| I had input from the superintendent and his staff, the special ed task force we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| and also I had it reviewed by the wall director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| so I am grateful for his input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| I think it's important to recognize the work of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and I think this resolution really codifies that the board supports that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| I think having the board stamp of approval works hand in hand with what Jason is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| and the work that his office will be doing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I think we have an opportunity to be the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| and give our students the education they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Just because they have a disability shouldn't mean they should have a disadvantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| especially for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| So I just wanted to kind of walk through the four action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| We broke some of these down of the major topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| and this doesn't include everything in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| so this just kind of gives a broader overview of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| So the first action establishes the clear guidelines and communication for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5698)|
| 1:35:06| Number two, the second action item equips staff with the needed resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| and this would include the necessity to bring in an outsider to support KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| in crafting the best practices, just as Mr. Myers had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| The third action is how we are going to approach lawsuits by employing those best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| And four basically establishes a council to help ensure that Knox County is completing those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| So that's kind of an overview of those four action items in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| I really appreciate the work that you did on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| and the work that the task force did on this, and the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| and just everyone that is involved in this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Some of my questions are that I've got the framework that Jason had put together in his slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5754)|
| 1:36:04| and I was curious if this might need to, because I see that it's success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| and then also mentioning special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| But then in his framework, special education with the task force is just 504 and IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| Is there any idea of potentially including all of these groups, RTI and ELL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5781)|
| 1:36:30| and then potentially families that do not yet have a 504 and IEP, or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5790)|
| 1:36:39| Because I think that that's one of the things that we are addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| and I think that you're also addressing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| is that those people that have kind of been identified are not yet identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| and making sure that they are also included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| I see this resolution as kind of being the broader scope of that, and then the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| This is basically, hey, we support the task force recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| and we want to implement those, and directing the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| in whatever that looks like to implement that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Ms. Henderson, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| You turned your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| That was all I had, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Seeing none, we will move on to Item H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| If possible, I would like to just roll this into my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| It will fit better there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| I mean, I'm going to leave it here for next time, but that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| And Item I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| It's always a fun topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Moving into our regular work session agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5882)|
| 1:38:14| we have our legislative update lobbying report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| Is that where you were going to roll it, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you, Heath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Last month, I shared the bills that TSBA presented to us during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Summer Legal and Legislative Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| In years past, we've also had an extensive report from class regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| all of the significant bills that were considered during session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| But since you've had those in your email every week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I won't plan to go over those unless members have specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Also in years past, there have been a lot of questions regarding what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| actually done during session by those who were advocating for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| And since that was not covered in your weekly updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| I'd like to share some of that with you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5939)|
| 1:39:06| It worked earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5946)|
| 1:39:17| It had to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| So I'd like to talk about to lobby or advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| our board responsibilities, my responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| TSBA's role, and the call for resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| While we often try to keep from using a disliked word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| in some cases it just isn't reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| and lobbying is one of those words that sometimes people don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| But when words have definitions that are in statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| we need to use the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| And in the case of lobbying or advocacy, word choice matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| and it's important for factual transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| A lobbyist is any person who engages in lobbying for compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Clearly I and we are not lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Lobbying does not make one a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| but lobbying for compensation makes one a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| There are also other rules related to the amount of lobbying one does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| would require an individual to register as a volunteer lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| However, this also does not apply to us as a board or as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| Lobbying is actually a responsibility of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| So to lobby is to communicate directly or indirectly with any official in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| the legislative branch or executive branch for the purpose of influencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| any legislative action or administrative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| So if we are talking to our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| and we are asking them to do something specific with a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| if we are asking them to pass a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| if we are asking them to move legislation forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| if we are asking them to change a retention law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| if we are asking them to do anything that is to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| either directly or indirectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| if we are trying to influence legislation, then we are lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| So there are lots of different ways we communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Sometimes we educate just sharing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Sometimes we advocate by supporting a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| We might support a position with each other here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| None of that would be lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| So lobbying is only when we are influencing legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| So it is important that we use that term when that is what we are actually doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| Last year, Channel 5 in Nashville did a little study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| and what they found is that there are 61 lobbyists right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| who are working specifically to privatize public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| They are working specifically against us, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| There are 17 public ed lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| and of course it is in the interest of the people with the top number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| to keep the bottom number low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| There are organizations spending millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| to keep that bottom number low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| The fewer lobbyists we have working for public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| the easier it is for profiteering organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| to work against public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| The longer we go without a qualified lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| the longer we continue to do a disservice to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| One board member cannot do the work of a qualified lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| but more importantly, one board member cannot do the lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| of nine board members and our district administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| We all need to be doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| It is imperative that we are all doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| But especially if we don't have a qualified lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| if we never put out that RFP for a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| it is absolutely urgent that we do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6162)|
| 1:42:49| If we take a look at Board Policy B241,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| School Board Legislative Involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| this policy has been around a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| and it says that the board will work for the passage of new laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| designed to advance the cause of improving education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and for the repeal or modification of existing laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| and the defeat of proposed laws that impede this cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| That's lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| A larger piece of that policy is on the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| and if you'd like to look at the whole policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| it's under your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| All of these things are lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| So the next piece of that policy is the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| of the legislative representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| So whoever the legislative representative is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| needs to ensure that this advocacy and lobbying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| that it is a year-round effort, that it's happening all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| The specific responsibilities are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and each year we've had questions about what our lobbyists have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| and how their tasks were carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| At the same time, some of our board members have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| they don't want to hear all that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| and this conflicting message made it really difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| for our lobbyists to meet our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| While I'm not a lobbyist, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| I have been the only person consistently representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| our interests in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| so I want to be sure that you're adequately informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| of what I have done and why one board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| cannot reasonably be expected to be the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| advocating and lobbying for Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| and the board in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| So let's look at the first part of my responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| ensuring that advocacy is a year-round effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| There were two failures on my part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| that I want to be accountable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| One was in assuming that executive committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| were reading the legislative update emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| but also in using passive language to communicate my willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| to give updates in May, June, and July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| rather than directly submitting the items to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| I felt like items were being pushed off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| but I don't believe it was actually understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| that regular updates were expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I think we corrected this last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| by adding a placeholder to each agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| I might also clarify that during the legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| the legislative representative should be very able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| to give an update at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| I certainly wouldn't be able to give a formal presentation immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| but if you wake me up in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| and ask me for a legislative update between February and April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| I can give you a legislative update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| because it is constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| If we look back at the board responsibilities for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| look at that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| The board shall stay informed of pending legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| and actively communicate its concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| and make its position known to the elective representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| at both the state and national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| If the person who is your legislative liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| is not actively and consistently helping you to stay fully informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| please ask for additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| If I am not keeping you consistently and adequately informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| I need to hear that I'm not keeping you adequately and consistently informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| whether it's me or whether it's someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| The next ones, I've given them numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| They were bullets in the policy, but bullet 2, 5, and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| being the point person between the board and TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| regarding legislative affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| attending TSBA meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| and attending TSBA meetings with other boards' legislative liaisons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| I have laid out for you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| These are the meetings that I attended as the legislative liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| Some of them were webinars, some of them were in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| but this is just a listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| While there were seven monthly meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| with our TSBA government relations people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| it's a far cry from the weekly meetings we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| with both board and administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| when we had a person who was working for our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| So we went from weekly meetings last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| to monthly meetings this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| which meant that I had to do a lot more of the legwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| to go out and find that information and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| TSBA is representing the agreed interests of all the school boards in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| and this can leave the interests of larger districts behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| To illustrate this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| I'd like you to think about something that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| at our September area meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| If we are looking at special school districts, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| there is a county that has five different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| I think it's five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| five different special school districts in that one county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| That county, because of their so many special districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| they have 37 board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Those 37 board members represent fewer than 5,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| And so their needs are exponentially covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| And when we look across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| there are many counties that are in similar situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| In that particular county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| they have a school board member for every 122 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| where we have one for every 6,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| So while our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| students across the state are going to have some similar needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| our district deserves our own professional working for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| The third bullet was providing updates to the board during the legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| And here are the dates that I provided updates to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Seven is communicating with legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| And the way I communicated with legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| was by making eight trips to Nashville for a total of seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| This is just from February to mid-April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| and does not include the TSBA Legislative Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| It was more than 56 hours of driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| 52 hours in the Cordell Hall building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| In an average week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| I spent four to six hours preparing reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| In an average week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| I spent four to six hours preparing reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| four to ten hours watching or listening to meeting videos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| five to ten studying amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| two to five in live meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| one or two visiting legislators of legislative offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| up to an hour calling legislative offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| and up to an hour talking with other advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| attorneys, lobbyists, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Obviously, some of these hours overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| such as listening to a meeting while driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| or calling legislative offices while driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| So, as you can see, it's a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| And I don't want anyone to feel that I'm complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| about the amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| What I'm telling you is that I need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| in covering this amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| And if it's not me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| whoever is the legislative liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| is going to need assistance from this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| If we don't have a person whose job it is to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| if we don't have someone who is there 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| we need to find a way for this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| to be sure that we are there and represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| at least three days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| every week, February until mid-April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| I had informal discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| There were over 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| and these are just the ones that I kind of can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| So that means either in the hallway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| or drop-ins with all of these legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| The ones who have a star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| are specifically legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| who were on the education committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| The formal meetings that I had in office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| this legislative session was difficult as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| and I'm not saying for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| it was difficult for our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| because there were so many education committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| that were formed this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| They were pretty much continually meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| So for them to be able to have meetings at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| was extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| A lot of their legislative meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| were back-to-back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| So talking to constituents was difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| I was very fortunate to get to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| a couple of times with Representative White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Representative Sopicke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Senator Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Senator Joey Hensley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| and with Representative Ron Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| But what did we talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| We talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| and this is all we could talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| because this is all that I am able to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| As your legislative representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| these are the priorities that I was given to carry to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| and so these are the only things I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| these are the only lobbying items I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| I can't go and lobby for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| I can't go and lobby for changes to laws about chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| I can't lobby for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| except what I've been given right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| So I think that's important for us to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| is that when I email and I give you an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| and I say, hey, here's this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| that we don't have a position on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| but you might find it concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| or you might find something that you want to support in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| I'm not saying that I am going to them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| That's me giving that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| So that would be completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| So when I do that, that is just for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| That's not something I'm discussing with those legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| The only thing I am lobbying is this right here, nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6742)|
| 1:52:30| I might ask them questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| so that I can bring those answers back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| An example would be we don't have a legislative priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| regarding the zero tolerance law that changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| but I could go and ask about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| and say how is this going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Can the superintendent still override this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| I can ask those questions and bring those back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| but I can't go and say I like this or I don't like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| and we're not going to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| These are the only things that I can discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| So the last thing to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| is looking at our third grade retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Last time we talked about the call for resolutions from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| The deadline is September 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| and when we met, was it last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Did we meet last week with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| I talked to Emily Warren after, last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| I talked to Emily Warren after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| and she said they have zero resolutions so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| regarding retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| So no other boards have submitted anything at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| which is maybe they're just waiting until the deadline, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| or maybe their meetings may be later than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| But if they have nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| I think we need to seriously consider that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| I don't think we need to make any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| to what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| I think everything that we have already put into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| covers everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| It covers local control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| It covers parent input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| It covers all of those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| So I think if we want to look at doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| we should do it just as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| There is another option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| that I want to be sure you're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| that Emily talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| The deadline is September 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| and what that means is if we submit a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| by September 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| it will be on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| to be voted on in November, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| Well, by us, by all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| We can submit it after September 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| If we submit it after September 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| then the Board of Directors of TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| would have to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| on whether it would be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| I don't imagine that they would vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| but we do have that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| if we are not prepared to do this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| if we want to think about it another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| We certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| We could put it off until October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| but if folks feel like we want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| if we feel like we want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| that they have that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| then we might want to go ahead and do it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| So if anybody has any feelings there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| we can talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| or if you have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| What questions do you have that I can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| What would the official process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| of giving that resolution to TSBA look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| The process would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| we would have to agree that we want to send this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| so we would vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| and if we vote to send it to TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| then I would give the resolution to Terry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| and Terry would send it to TSBA, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Well, I just think thanks are in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| Thank you for all the effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| all the hours and everything you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| and also, I guess I should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| they say confession is good for the soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| I just want to say I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| I didn't read everything you sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| It was a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| It was a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| But what I did, what I was able to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| and take in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| it was very helpful in understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| where we are in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| and why it's so important for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| to stay plugged in legislatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| So thank you for your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Ms. Owen, how long have you been playing that role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| for the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| I mean, I know it's been the whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| I've been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| I meant to have a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| I have been doing it since I came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Karen Carson did it before I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| And as she went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| I asked to do it when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| Something to know about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| is that when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| now that we're having meetings all together again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| what I've found is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| very few legislative reps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| have done it more than one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| Most of them are brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| I mean, it is a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| I know I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| I would not do it nearly as well as you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| but I do agree that we all need to be supporting the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| Going back to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| you made the comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| procurement of a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| I know when we had discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| all of that last year, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| that was a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| And I'm assuming that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| the action of a specific board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| would need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| It might be good for us to get some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| from procurement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| what that specific process would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| related to a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| I'm sure it might look a little bit different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| other types of positions, maybe, that we would fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| But I think it would be good if we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| some information from procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I'm sure we're not going to suspend the rules on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| So, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Yeah, I don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| I would like the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| that we would need to be able to take action on that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| if that's something we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| All right. We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| I think procurement could do that pretty easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| because they have done that for county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| So, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| So, moving on to Item 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| Mr. Grubb, could we put this one up on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| This item is just to make me hush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| which I think we will all appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| So, last time I asked about our board member compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| and making sure it was transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| And what Mr. McPherson did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| is he went back into the budget that we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| and he put in a line noting that county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| may approve a raise for county staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| which would in turn give us a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| That does get the point across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| However, when we click on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| what it says is this is the approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| So, it appears that that line was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| when we approved the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| which is another transparency issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| So, I thought, okay, what can we do to make this easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| So, what we're doing to make this easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| is here we are in this public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Here is this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| It is as clear as mud so that everyone has it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Everyone knows exactly what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| And there it is on the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| Does anyone have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| So, any other questions or discussions on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Moving on to Item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| I have learned a whole lot about our background check processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| in the past few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| And I would welcome Dr. Adams jumping in at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| Basically, there are different levels of background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| depending on how much access people will have to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| For example, if I were at the teacher depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| and I were having people come in and help sort books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| they would have no access to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| And so, that would be a very different level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| than if we had a person who is going on a field trip with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| and will be a lone supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| So, that is something to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| is that there are different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| And so, when people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| well, this person had this kind of background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| and this person had this kind of background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| and how is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| It is right because of their contact with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| So, that is one thing that is important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| I think I would like to see some kind of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| for ensuring that our schools are doing our checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| the same way from school to school to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| so that everyone is really looking at that the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| So, I would like to see that if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| And anything else you can tell us about background check processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| I would be glad to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| So, the background checks, that is actually an HR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| That is in the HR's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| What we do with our school visitor management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| that is where we get involved for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| for anyone to have access to our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| So, that is where we would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Now, we work very closely with HR as far as the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| and how we identify the different levels of the background checks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| I am calling those the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| and that may be where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Because I know that that visitor management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| is a little tiny background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| So, that is what I am thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| is that visitor management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| where people are first coming into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| And then there are people who are questioning the background check process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| because maybe they have been through the visitor management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| and they are confused between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Yes, and the visitor management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| it is only to flag people who do not need to be in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| or have access to our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| So, the background check itself, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| that will go through the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| I will let Ms. Hemelgarn speak more to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| The HR department recently took in all background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| So, obviously, employee background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| previously lived with human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| but now the school volunteer background checks do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| And you are correct that there is a scale of involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| that would determine what, if any, type of background check is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| The HR liaisons for each region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| are overseeing the background check implementation and oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| and they are currently reviewing the processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| to make sure that they are consistent across regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| and also to make recommendations for how to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| Can we have an update on custodial staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| Madam Chair, yes, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| So, out of our 398 positions, we currently have 89 vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| 11 of those schools exceed the 50% mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| as far as vacancies are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| We do have 40 schools that are fully staffed, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| But we also have, we anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| about eight custodians retiring this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| We'll have approximately looking to retire in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| We'll have three looking to retire in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| So, although our numbers are not as near as where they were last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| we are continuing to have multiple applicants come in for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| I know I've spoken to some personally, and so it's just the ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| We've got very high-quality applicants coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| but as we have, you know, with attrition, we've lost a few positions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| So, we are closely monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| I will tell you, Dr. Reiswick has made it very clear with his SHL team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| that we need to have the pulse of Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| and so I've been in multiple schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| I actually had a scheduled meeting with a custodian two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| and it was an hour meeting, which was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| And so, we're still feeling a lot of those pains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| and we're really trying to understand what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| Back to Mr. Myers, what he had said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| trying to give our custodians the tools they need to be successful in the support that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| So, we will continue to revisit that and work very closely with HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| to ensure that we continue to fill those vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| and if we need to provide additional support, we will certainly look at those options as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| And the last thing I wanted to look at was our substitute processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| and I don't think I talked about this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| What I'm hearing from people who are certified teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| who have worked with Knox County schools but have retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| they may be more than a year since they retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Maybe it's been a year and a half or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| And so, they are having to go back through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| and back through the background checks and all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| and what they are saying is that it's taken six to eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| for them to get on a substitute list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| And so, I don't have anything to verify that except their personal stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| and I've heard from several people that it's taken them a really long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| For these folks who are certified teachers and want to sub for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| it's taken them a long time to get them onto the sub list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| So, I'm hoping we can look at some way to kind of speed that process up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| especially since they've been our employees, some of them for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| if there's any way to look at something to expedite that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7583)|
| 2:06:31| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, yes, we can definitely take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| You are correct that if the break in employment has been longer than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| there are a couple extra steps, hopefully not six to eight weeks worth of steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| but we will revisit that to see where we can make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| All right, so is there anything else on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7611)|
| 2:06:59| All right, so moving on to public forum, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| First up, Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| Oh, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| We have nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Do you want to take a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| Does anyone want to take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Does anyone need a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| Courtney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| Okay, got to make sure I have the right glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| My name is Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| I'm also a member of the Special Education Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| When I accepted the superintendent's appointment to the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I was optimistic, but I didn't know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| I think most of my fellow task force members felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| We felt like we'd all been here before, yelling into the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| Special education services are broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| Something needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| There's a culture of resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| Help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| I was pleasantly surprised at and grateful for the reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| and support our work has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| The report that Jason Myers provided the board is sobering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| and closely mirrors the task force report and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| In fact, I would say that our recommendations provide an actionable roadmap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| for implementation of his commitments and focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| And Mr. Myers, you have my full support to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| While I acknowledge that change will not happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| I believe the pace of change can be accelerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| Two specific recommendations that can accelerate the pace of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| is hiring an outside inclusion expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| and establishing a special education code of conduct for all of its employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| that Vice Chair Henderson has mentioned in her resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| To me, as a parent of children with all different abilities in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| as an employer who hires and also bears the responsibility of letting people go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| and as someone who takes a great deal of pride in being an active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| and engaged member of our community, I see the path forward very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Accelerating the pace of special education improvement begins with leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| Setting clear expectations for the special education director and all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| setting a new culture, one that values inclusion, follows the law, and puts students first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| A leader who sets this new culture celebrates and recognizes employees that embrace it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| and delivers consequences when expectations are not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| For example, parents continue to be told things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| the principal will approve your request for a private practitioner in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| specifically relating to ABA therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| This was not in the policy the board passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| I fielded no fewer than half a dozen calls with this odd interpretation of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| It wasn't until I made a second desperate plea to Mr. Myers for help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| after a parent actually recorded a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| that he assigned someone to clarify the policy with principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| But this is still happening. How?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| Or in my case, I have yet to be approved for my son's ABA therapist to join him in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| despite submitting my information in July and countless attempts by my provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| to contact health services to obtain clarity and direction on the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| We can make Knox County Schools a model district for special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| by following the task force recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Vice Chair Henderson's resolution is an important one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| to end the culture of resistance that's been allowed to fester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| and I thank her for her leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| Additionally, there are other items on your agenda that will address some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| laid out by Mr. Myers and the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| The Student Success Accountability Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| and subcontracting for certain services and positions are all steps in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Thank you, Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Jennifer Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| State your name and county of residence. I feel like you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| You know the drill, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Jennifer Rose, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| I just want to thank you, Ms. Henderson, for putting the resolutions up in front of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| and thank all of you guys for listening and taking those into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| along with thanking the task force for all of their hard work in coming up with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| I want to also thank and let Dr. Ronswick and Mr. Myers know that we here as parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| are here to support any way we can to bring these resolutions forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| The findings of the task force, along with the recommendations, are on point and cover issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| along with concerns parents have been facing and advocating for for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| Along with all the other parents, I ask that you all please support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| both share in the urgency to make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| As Ms. Courtney said, we know they can't happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| but if we all work together, collaborate, and come together as one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| we can make them happen faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Putting our kids first is the top priority for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| We don't want to have to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| We don't want to go to the IEP meetings and continuously fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| We'll tell you firsthand, me and my husband have been fighting since our son started school three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| We were over a month into school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| I couldn't tell you who my child's special education teacher is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| They've not reached out one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| We have encountered issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| His nurse was out one day, and he did not get his medication at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| To no fault of her own, it was the sub-nurse, but not trained, not knowing what needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| Fortunately, with the medication he's on, that can be very detrimental to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| We continuously face medical issues that we shouldn't be facing or even having to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| Our children need to be safe at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| We need to entrust those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| My son throws a fit not wanting to go to school because he doesn't want to deal with his special education teacher when she comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7971)|
| 2:12:58| because all he reports is that she's mean and yells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| So I've asked and told him just to tell his teacher because his teacher is absolutely wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| His general education teacher is, and that's where he's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| But we're here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| We want to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| We don't want to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| So I just urge that we put the urgency in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Let us be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| And by bringing in an outside source to look at everything would be the best beneficial way to go about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8002)|
| 2:13:29| and along with bringing in the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| Michelle, I saw you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| Just state your name and county of residence in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| Hi, my name is Michelle Meehan, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| My son, Max, is a second grader, and he has Down syndrome, and he's eligible for special education services under developmental delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| I'm here tonight to comment and thank Mrs. Henderson for her resolution to make Knox County Schools a model district for excellence in special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8040)|
| 2:14:10| which I think is a lofty task, but a very important one that will demand proper implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8050)|
| 2:14:16| I spoke at the last Board of Education meeting directly about the task force recommendation number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| bringing in an expert in inclusion and providing the teachers and administrators with the support and resources they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| I have read Mrs. Henderson's resolution a few too many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| and I'm wondering if line item two, which says identify opportunities to make success for every student a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8073)|
| 2:14:41| does this item number include the crucial recommendation of bringing in an outside inclusion expert to help correct the path forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8081)|
| 2:14:50| I believe that an outside inclusive schooling expert can and will address all of the other recommendations made by the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| If so, can the resolution be amended to clearly define bringing in an outside inclusion expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| a timeline for hiring the contractors, and a timeline for when they start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| Children with intellectual disabilities are already behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| They will not be best served if this recommendation is delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| I think many of you board members have seen that we as fed parents have been organizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| to bring these recommendations to the attention of all KCS fed parents in our force Facebook group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| We all have our niche and passion when it comes to our children's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| If you ask my friends, my wheelhouse would be inclusion and modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| I'm extremely passionate about both, but mostly inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| When our son was diagnosed at birth with Down syndrome, my husband and I made a promise to our baby boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| that we would provide him with a full and enriching life, and with all the early interventions and services that he would break glass ceilings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8152)|
| 2:16:01| And in the disability world, showing people that his worth should not be measured by his disability, but rather by his ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8161)|
| 2:16:10| My son is fully included in the general education setting with a one-to-one aid, modified content, and minimal pullout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8170)|
| 2:16:17| which is a rarity in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| I think about 10 to 20 students who hired an advocate or a lawyer got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8179)|
| 2:16:26| I have been a stay-at-home mom for 12 years now, and all my children are at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| I devote an unfortunate amount of time to make sure his IAP is properly implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| I know I am extremely fortunate to have this time to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| However, there are a handful of other opportunities I would love to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| And many families have two parents working outside the home, and they simply don't have this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| The problem is deep within the KCSI department, and I believe it is unrealistic to ask them to fix the problems outside their own ability to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8212)|
| 2:17:02| What would you do if this was your child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| Laura Hoffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Laura?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Just at your nine county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| Laura Hoffer from Knox County, and my son has had an IAP since he first began preschool at age three in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| He is now in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| I'm here today to ask you to adopt the Special Education Task Force recommendations, which are spectacular and long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8254)|
| 2:17:42| My son was born very premature with significant health issues, and today has over 20 disabilities and diagnoses on his medical profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| Medically and educationally, he has been through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| My son's IAP is serviced in his least restrictive environment of the general education classroom, and he is proof that inclusion works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8273)|
| 2:18:02| He is a happy student, a gifted reader, and last year he won his third grade class spelling bee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8282)|
| 2:18:10| However, there have also been many challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| As one example, my husband and I just spent the last full year advocating for our son's specific learning disorder in math to be recognized on his IAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8292)|
| 2:18:22| Last September, we attended our son's annual meeting with two private evaluations indicating his learning disorder in math, which the school declined to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8302)|
| 2:18:32| So we asked the school to conduct its own evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| After many months, they came back, again claiming he did not have a learning disorder in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| We then asked for an independent education evaluation, the results of which were returned to us on the final day of his third grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8321)|
| 2:18:49| Took the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Of course, those results indicated our son does indeed have a learning disorder in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| We then waited all summer for the IAP meeting to address it, and though the school just recently agreed to add it as a tertiary eligibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| they told us that no new goals and no new services, supports, or specialized math programming would be added to his IAP to actually help him progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8343)|
| 2:19:12| This, of course, is not our only struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| It's just the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| My husband and I are also educators, and we're disappointed for our son, but also for our son's dedicated teachers, who we know want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8357)|
| 2:19:27| So the superintendent's appointment of the Special Education Task Force has given us great hope that there are calmer waters ahead for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8367)|
| 2:19:36| The recommendations made by the task force provide an accurate overview of the parts of the KCIP that need repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8376)|
| 2:19:44| Recommendation number one is a good suggestion, asking for a new code of conduct to steer administration and teachers towards saying yes rather than no when asked to meet students' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8384)|
| 2:19:56| Recommendation number two is a good suggestion, asking for an external expert in inclusion and structural reforms to provide advice on issues such as resourcing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8396)|
| 2:20:07| so that teachers have the necessary support after giving students that yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| I encourage you to adopt these recommendations in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8419)|

| 2:20:25| Tiffany?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| Just state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8431)|

| 2:20:40| Hello again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| You might remember me from my previous speech in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| I'm a proud parent of four children who attend Knox County schools, two of whom have IEPs for autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| I am thrilled to support Ms. Henderson's Special Task Force recommendations wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| These recommendations are imperative for the success of our children in school, and I graciously endorse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8454)|
| 2:21:01| Mr. Meyer's report to the Board of Education this evening underscores the need for adopting the SPED Task Force recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8461)|
| 2:21:09| As concerned parents, we have not yet been able to witness the modification bank that we have been told exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| Although we have been informed that modifications have been made, we have also heard that the materials given to the teachers must be more specific and tailored to their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8475)|
| 2:21:25| It is alarming to hear that teachers are provided with links that do not match the content taught or relate to the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8485)|
| 2:21:32| The modification bank needs to be transparent, as we have been told that it exists and teachers have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| But at other times during meetings, the teachers have yet to learn what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| We speak for many parents when we say we need to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| However, we are not allowed to see it, which is surprising because it is a public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| I'm proud to say that creating exceptional modifications requires time and a thorough understanding of what works best for each child's learning needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8514)|
| 2:22:03| I am incredibly grateful to the teachers and the special education teacher at New Hopewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| who are quickly becoming true experts in creating exceptional modifications for my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| When my son receives an effective and properly prepared modification, which he is entitled to gain access to the general education setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8536)|
| 2:22:26| he claps his hands to his chest with excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| He puts a smile on his face that will melt your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| Their brilliant modification should not be limited to just my son, but also be available to other children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8555)|
| 2:22:43| Their work can act as a motivation for developing other modifications more suitable for different learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8563)|
| 2:22:50| In a written communication with Ms. Christie regarding the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| I was pleased to hear that she was excited about the prospect of parents contributing to the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| Having more people involved is essential as it will help us achieve our goal faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| I am eagerly awaiting a response from Michelle Flynn and Daphne Odom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| who are leading the initiative, to clarify some questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| We sincerely hope that our children's education hasn't been compromised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| and that the necessary steps have been taken to ensure a high-quality learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| Carrie Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Carrie. Ann. Sorry. Yeah, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| I'm going to bet you're a lot. I can never pronounce your last name, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8613)|
| 2:23:41| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| Hello. I am Carrie Burge. I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| I am a parent with two children in KCS District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| I am here tonight in support of the resolution to make KCS a model district for excellence in special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8633)|
| 2:24:00| My son's IEP is not currently in compliance with federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| My son's IEP has stated that speech therapy would be provided to him once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| Federal law also states with speech that data or an evaluation is required at least once every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8650)|
| 2:24:18| My son has not had either one since 2017, which was his first and his only evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8658)|
| 2:24:27| He was in kindergarten in 2017. Guys, he's in seventh grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| He's in seventh grade now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| And Knox County employees have not provided consistent speech therapy to my son in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8674)|
| 2:24:43| It is my belief, if there was more consistency with this type of therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| that there would not be as many children affected by, say, the third grade retention law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| Spoken language provides the foundation for the development of reading and writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| If COVID showed us anything, it was that one year of loss can throw our children off course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| So if children are receiving the services on a consistent basis, it will only help to increase, say, reading proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| Because of these situations, I'm in support of the new job position of someone to oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| and make KCS in compliance with these types of services and other special education laws and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8718)|
| 2:25:27| Currently, as he said, there were three vacant positions for speech providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| Three vacant positions represents approximately 200 kids that are not receiving speech therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8732)|
| 2:25:39| That's roughly 200 IEPs not in compliance at this very moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| While working with the task force, I found out that there were lawsuits due to FTI, which is failure to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8745)|
| 2:25:53| No matter which services it is pertaining to, this is not acceptable anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| There is a solution to these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| There is a possibility of subcontracting services from a company that only focuses on these needs and responsibilities of managing it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8760)|
| 2:26:10| So I encourage the superintendent and the school board to take action now and approve this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| so that we can actually start providing the best learning environment for every Knox County student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| Melanie Flurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| I have to go get the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8789)|
| 2:26:35| This is my first time speaking, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| I am Melanie Flurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Is that what I have to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| I will be speaking tonight on item number six from tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| First of all, thank you for allowing me, a simple parent, to just speak my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| Normally we don't have a voice, so it really does mean a lot that you let us come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| I'm here to persuade you not only to approve Ms. Henderson's recommendations and resolutions, but to also add a little verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8823)|
| 2:27:13| So here's my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| This is my son, Elijah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| He attends Carnes Elementary School in District Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| His Gen Ed classmates describe him as kind, quiet, and funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8842)|
| 2:27:32| According to their parents, they speak often about him, and believe it or not, they say things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8852)|
| 2:27:39| he's important, and he teaches me to be more patient, and it's okay to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8859)|
| 2:27:45| So thank you to Forward Thinking of KCS for letting Elijah be in a Gen Ed setting because of the inclusiveness and the environment that he's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8865)|
| 2:27:58| That is also helping the Gen Ed students, which is going to help Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| Nevertheless, our journey has been marked by challenges and obstacles when it comes to his IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| Despite all of your efforts, what happens on your desk sometimes does not convey to his desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8890)|
| 2:28:17| So I'm here to remind you that we need accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| We need a follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| You guys might say, yeah, let's do this, but if somebody's not making sure that you're actually doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| when it comes to the parents, we have to fight tooth and nail just to get what every other student gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| So Ms. Henderson had a lot of resolutions that were all great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| One of the things that she mentioned was having an external agent come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| I would like to propose that the word inclusion be used in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| We really want to have somebody from an external agent that is an expert in an inclusive environment come in because this is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8931)|
| 2:29:02| So I would propose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| But then also on Thursday, I really plead that you all approve her resolutions and the recommendations that were made by the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8944)|
| 2:29:14| And also I wanted to say thank you to Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| You have been excellent and you've been very communicative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| You've communicated very well to us parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| So when he talks the talk, he is also walking the walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| Lauren Cordova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| Just state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| Lauren Cordova, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| I first just want to say a big thank you to the board and to Dr. Myers and to Ms. Henderson for you accepting the task force recommendations with open arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8987)|
| 2:29:59| and thinking of creative solutions for how we do the work that's ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=8999)|
| 2:30:05| For those of you who may not know or remember, I am also a Knox County school special education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| This is my 10th year in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| I currently work at Ridgedale Alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| I do want to encourage the board to adopt Ms. Henderson's resolutions as well as to encourage for that inclusion expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9015)|
| 2:30:24| I think just as a Knox County schools employee that that would help empower our school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| Even though we all like to consider ourselves experts in the field, there's always ways that we can learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| There are people who know more from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| And I think that's crucial in how we look forward and really honing in on our inclusion and what that looks like for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9039)|
| 2:30:51| I also want to take some time right now to kind of point out some internal things that I noticed as a Knox County schools teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9051)|
| 2:31:02| When we look at staffing issues, I think one of them is to look at the job requirements that are being asked, especially out of our educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9062)|
| 2:31:13| I started as an EA. I'm now a teacher. I can tell you that the work that I was asked to do as an EA is exponential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9073)|
| 2:31:20| You're not always fully trained to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| You have a lot of requirements with not a lot of benefits and not a lot of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9085)|
| 2:31:39| I do think that it is important to note that until we start looking at the salary and the benefits that we're asking of our employees, that our retention rates will still continue to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9099)|
| 2:31:50| It's something that I hear every day out of my EAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| It's a lot of work for not a lot of money, and they're always looking for new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| And I think that's really important that the board considers and takes into their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| Allison Pasternak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9127)|
| 2:32:17| Allison Pasternak, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| First of all, I wanted to also echo all of our gratitude to Ms. Henderson for proposing this resolution, and I would also like to thank Mr. Myers for the work you have put into the special education interim report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9141)|
| 2:32:34| I would like to emphasize the importance of the tasks, the six tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| I don't remember exactly what you called them, but on your list for improving SPED services and implementing the KCS way for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9158)|
| 2:32:46| While implementing all of these items is imperative to improving KCS special education services, I would like to focus on just a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9166)|
| 2:32:53| Number one being expanding coaching and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| Mr. Myers says that they have established modification resources to enhance inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| My son, I'm very happy to report, is now in the general education setting, all but one hour a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| He has been receiving modified work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| His teachers have worked so hard to modify his lessons to meet the AAD standards, and I greatly appreciate their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9189)|
| 2:33:17| But I can say that the student-specific training they had over the summer was insufficient and ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| He had no teachers that had worked with him prior to this year in that meeting, and the only person who knew him was a consultant-type position, autism support, who meets with him for about four and a half hours per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9204)|
| 2:33:41| So unfortunately, despite the hours, I would assume, of work that these teachers have put into modifying my son's work, they were well above his abilities, and that made them inaccessible for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9221)|
| 2:33:55| So having maybe parents involved or some other people involved that could actually convey the abilities of the student before these teachers spent hours modifying work would be really effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9235)|
| 2:34:09| It also seems that the modification resources that have been mentioned a few times now in these meetings are not as helpful as we would all have hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9249)|
| 2:34:20| I would encourage the powers that be to reimagine—I'm jumping a little bit, sorry—going back to the modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9260)|
| 2:34:30| I have gotten some feedback from teachers that say they are way too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| Some have looked at me when I've asked about the modification bank, and they have no idea what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| Or they are just not—they can't transfer what's on the modifications bank to where my son is and what he needs to be learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9283)|
| 2:34:52| So that definitely still needs some work because these teachers are trying so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| And then as far as the trainings, I'm going to wrap this up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| Giving the teachers some practical knowledge that they can bring back to their classrooms rather than just legal explanations for what they're required to do would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9301)|
| 2:35:10| Sometimes they just get all this legal information about what they're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| They don't know how to apply that, and that's what they really need to help them do these jobs better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| So thank you all. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| Moving on to board forum, Ms. Hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| We had a Teacher Supply Depot opening this past Saturday, and also—has it been two weeks? Maybe it's been two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9343)|
| 2:35:51| And we also had an opening for new teachers over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| And I just want the board to know that numbers are incomplete right now, but it looks like the Teacher Depot was able to supply our teachers and assistants with around $70,000 worth of supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=9355)|
