| 0:00:17| We'll start with a moment of silence and the pledge led by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=22)|
| 0:00:46| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=46)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| I apologize for the delay in starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| The board was in executive session and Mr. Dupler, I'm going to ask you to give a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| words about that if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| That's correct, the board was in executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| That is the board's only opportunity to meet and discuss, I'm sorry, the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| office is the one that actually discusses litigation with regard to school issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| It is not an opportunity for the board to deliberate or discuss the issues amongst themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| and it is an exception to the Open Meetings Act under a case called Smith County Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| v. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=105)|

| 0:01:56| Seeing none, board members, you got a couple of emails this afternoon about a few changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| in the agenda I'd like to announce publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=124)|

| 0:02:13| Auditorium Lighting Project, the Special Education Recruitment and Retention Incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| Plan and our Strategic Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| And we will be reviewing those as we review the meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| It's also attached to your agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Do we have any other changes to the meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| Seeing none, I'd like a motion to approve the work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=162)|

| 0:03:06| As most of you are aware, Knox County schools will be closed tomorrow and Friday due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| flu-like illnesses that are causing increasing absences of both teachers and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| We hope this time out of school these two days, plus the weekend, will give them time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| to rest and feel better and be ready to go on Monday, February 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| We will be cleaning and disinfecting each school facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=201)|

| 0:05:11| All right, moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| The Community Health Council update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Council Chair, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| You're not Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| And I apologize, I did not get your name written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| If you'd introduce yourself, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Good evening to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| I'm Mitch Olszewski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I am the chair-elect of the Community Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| We serve Knox County, the city of Knoxville, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| I just wanted to let you know that your decision to close the schools was a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| My 11-year-old got sent home today, so it's working fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| First I wanted to say thank you very much from the Community Health Council for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| support and your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| What we're giving you today is, it should be in front of you, is a copy of the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| And this gives you a snapshot of what we did this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| And this gives you an update of each one of our Community Health Council Community Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| That's the CHIP, C-H-I-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| The CHIPs come out of the community health assessment that is done periodically in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| There's one actually just finishing up as we speak, and so we will be reviewing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| CHIPs in the summertime and possibly continuing some, maybe bringing some new ones in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| The plan that we use is basically a roadmap for improving four priority health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Mental health, opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| All four of which are obviously of importance to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| The particular CHIPs that we have right now have been in existence since 2016 and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| expiring this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| The final report of the CHIP activity for those years will be coming out in June of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| 2019, and you will all be getting a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| What we did in each case of the CHIP was to partner with a local organization that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| already working in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| We're not looking to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| We're not looking to come in and tell anybody, hey, you know, we're from the Community Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| We know what you're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| And so what we did is we worked with Active Knox on active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| We worked with Smokefree Knoxville on tobacco use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| We worked on the Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force on the opioid abuse issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| There really wasn't a current activity in the area of mental health that we felt really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=475)|
| 0:08:04| worked out real well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| And so we helped to put together the Mental Health Task Force, and that's who we're primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| working through on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Well, kind of what have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Over the past year, our partners have broken new ground in data collection and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| Once you start getting into this, you find out that a lot is not known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| There are a lot of data gaps, and it's tough to really make an impact in an area if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| don't know where you're starting from and being able to identify a quantitative measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| of where you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| We have improved outreach to people struggling with addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| We have educated policy makers, medical professionals, parents and children on some of the most pressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| health issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| So you can see we did a lot of educational activities, and we have also identified a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| lot of data needs and started some efforts to try and address those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| We have seen some positive trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Adult suicide rates have decreased in this three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| The amount of opioids prescribed have obviously decreased because of state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| And smoking rates among youth and pregnant women have gone down also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| Now, when we first started this, vaping wasn't even an issue, and so we're working to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| and incorporate those kinds of numbers now into the smoking issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| We still have a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| We haven't solved all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Opioid overdose deaths continues to be a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Suicide attempts among youth are a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| Pedestrian and bicycle crashes with cars is not improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| You have the draft report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| We will be giving you an exam after this meeting, and whoever scores the highest gets a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| prize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| We don't really have any specific ask for you at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| We wanted to make you aware of the progress on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| We feel that the school system continues to work with the health department to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| the youth risk behavior survey in middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| We applaud that, even though it is no longer mandated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| We think it's an important piece of data that we need, and we're grateful because this keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| our data collection very robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| We look forward to any opportunity to work together that you might define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=654)|
| 0:11:03| In June, you will receive a copy of the final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| In that final report, there will be a lot more meat on the bones, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| We will detail what was done, what impacts were realized, and we will give a lot of nuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| to those issues and what has been accomplished, so that you can understand why certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| were successful, why certain things weren't successful, and what we need to do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| With that, my presentation is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| I would be happy to answer any questions, if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Mr. Chvosky, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| I'm hoping that it will be an open book test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Oh, darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Give us a few minutes, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Looking now at the agenda for Wednesday, I am on Item 5, Consent Agenda, C, number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=722)|

| 0:12:46| Yes, Mr. Dupler, please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| On Item number C-8, board members, that may be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| It's not been approved as a form yet, but I'm working with Rob Spees at Fulton to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| and see if we can't amend that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| But we'll let you know before next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Ms. Horne, did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Great, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Item 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=798)|
| 0:13:45| Moving on to number 6, Board Policies, A, B, C, or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=825)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| I did have a question about, I noticed the vaping thing was added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| I was just curious about how our staff, how our administration handles the discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=854)|
| 0:14:24| of somebody who is vaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| How is that handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| What would be sort of the progression of penalties or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| Do we have a policy that guides the principles or how they're supposed to handle vaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you, Madam Chair and Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Yes, the policies do prescribe or give principals the flexibility to do what they feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=891)|
| 0:14:59| they need to do in terms of someone who commits the offense as well as multiple commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| of the same offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| So I think we're covered with policy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| I don't know, Dr. Roswick, if you've got anything to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| They pretty much follow the same as the tobacco currently in the guidelines that Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| So that's in the ones that were passed for that, pretty much follow the exact same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| So what is like first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| I would have to look again to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I know Ms. Asher is in the crowd and also I think Ms. Brennan just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Just ask Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| We can ask Becky if she'd like to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Being a high school principal, she's going to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| As I said, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I'll only answer if you promise to approve our grant that's up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| We do treat it just like cigarettes because, you know, it's been found to have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| level of nicotine in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| And so first offense is two to four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| And then it just, most schools, or most principals that I know, it's two days, five days, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| then strike three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| So at least two days for the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| So what are you finding in L&N now as far as the vaping issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| It's just like other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Students don't think that the adults understand that the sudden appearance of these jackets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| with big sleeves is so they can puff down inside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| But we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| So it's the same when I was just at a conference across country and it's pretty funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| You realize that things are the same all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I was talking to somebody from Michigan and they're like, these stupid yules, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| the vaping devices, they're like, the kids think that it's not a cigarette so it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| really smoking and it's rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Absolutely rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| So how many kids in your school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| That we have suspended to this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I know you're going rampant, really, but if you look at how many we have suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| for smoking on campus, zero in the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| So for us it's about awareness and I'll tell you the hard part is catching it because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1045)|
| 0:17:35| can't, when they puff it down into the jacket, there's no smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I mean, I know you remember the days when you had bathroom duty, you'd stand there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| you could see the smoke signals coming out of the stall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| You can't see that anymore so you have to rely on smell because they do have a scent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| and you have to rely on their friends, well, maybe not their friends, you have to rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| on other students saying, hey, so and so is doing this and then, you know, when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| probable cause to search and it's a lot of times the device itself looks like a USB drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| so I would imagine there have been some instances where people actually saw the device and misidentified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| it as what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| So for the two kids that you had suspended, you searched them and you found the jewel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| In an Altoids case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| They're that small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| That gets pretty, pretty cumbersome, I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Yes, Ms. Drennan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| I just want to add that along with the consequences, there is a huge national push from the Surgeon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| General's office because they recognize what an epidemic this is among our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| So you're going to see a lot of push in the media around public service announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| trying to educate families about the dangers of these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| And we at the local level, we have some, we're working real closely with the MDC to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| education so that we're trying to push that in our health classes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| I just wanted you to know that we are, we realize that the way to combat this is through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| And it will certainly have consequences, but I would venture to guess that we haven't changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| that behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| We really have to approach it from an education standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| We are into number seven, grants, letter A. Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1162)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Would you like to just hear more about this particular contract, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, Madam Chair, Dr. Ryser will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| We're learning to shuffle over here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Ms. Horn, thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| This is actually part of the grant that was approved earlier, the STEM grant that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| I think it's a five-year grant that we have for after school, growing the STEM program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| through our science department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Ms. Berry spoke to that a couple months back in October, but this is actually a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| There's a requirement for an external evaluator, and Wes Ed was the evaluator that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| So this is actually just the contractual part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I know Dr. Denton is in the crowd if you want specifics to the overall grant, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| the portion of that that was the external evaluator that was approved as part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Would you like to hear more about the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Dr. Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Laura Denton, do you have specific questions or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| No, I was, I just, I don't, I'm not sure I remember exactly what Dr. Ryser was referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| So just a quick summary would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Ms. Berry spoke to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| I believe it was actually the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And this is a five-year education, innovation, and research grant that we received from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| We were one of just a handful of grantees across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| So it's a five-year grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| We're going to start in year one at five of our elementary schools working with fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| In year two, we'll expand to 10 schools working with third through fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| And it's actually a summer camp, break camp kind of program that's going to run year round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| to expose those kiddos to STEM educational concepts and STEM careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| One second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I remember that conversation and I know we were, you all were still in limbo as to which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| schools you were going to select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Did you all decide what schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| And so let's see if I can do this off cuff or if I need to go pull my notes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| The fifth school, do you remember what it became?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| So now we've got Bell Morris, Cedar Bluff, Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| Sarah Morgreen and which South Knox school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| I will get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Ms. Berry took care of that part and she has a kiddo with the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| But I'll get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| If you might just email the board that, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Ms. Satterfield, you have a wonderful memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| She's younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| She's younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| Letter B. C. D. And E. Yes, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1352)|
| 0:22:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| We're on E, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| My question is sort of indirect to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| First, it's more about how are we, how are we doing as far, well, let me go directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| at the IPED card here first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| This is a replacement card, I'm assuming, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| I might ask Mr. Ryswick, would you know, would you have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I'm not 100% positive, Mr. Norman, if it's a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| I know Bearden Middle School has been part of the Digital Promise Network for the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| couple of years, and as some of those funds, and it was initially where there was access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| and iPads and things provided for the students, Carter Middle School was another one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And so this, as funding has pulled away, I think they continue to find grants and various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| other things to continue to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| They have a maker space in their library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| So my understanding is that this is for the iPads that were left at the school as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| of the original grant, and this is a grant for them to have a charging station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| So I'm not positive if it's a replacement or if it's one for those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| My real concern is a much broader issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| I hear in the communities that when it comes to technology, we may be less than diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| at protecting what we have in terms of our capital investment in devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| So, for example, Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Do we have within the system some effort to analyze how well we're doing at maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1470)|
| 0:24:43| these systems, securing these systems, keeping the systems working, ensuring that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| not abused, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| If I'm following your question, you're talking about physical security of the devices more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| than electronic security or network security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Physical security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| They're not tossing them across the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| They shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| We rely on the school staff to oversee that and take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| I think Ms. Byard is here, I believe, and she may be able to talk to you a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| about what our process is to look at those and do those repairs and get those back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| But we do most of those repairs on those in-house, and I haven't seen anything that's abnormal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Gail, you're closer to that than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| So I'm just wondering, Gail, if when we look at the devices we have, say, at one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| we analyze or we look at how much money we're spending to replace those devices on a yearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| basis, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| We certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| And some of that has to do with the age of the devices at various schools because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| do vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| But we do keep, we look at that very frequently, as a matter of fact, and we try to make contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| with the schools if there's an issue that's arising that makes one school stand out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Would, is there a line item in the budget for us as far as replacement or maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| values for these, for technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| So there is a maintenance and repair that covers, and it's a line item in my budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| that covers all devices in the district, whether it's a staff device, central office, schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| So there's a repair budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| You know, it is stretched very thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| And there are times when there is either neglect, total loss, or if it's deemed to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1609)|
| 0:26:58| negligence, then the school collects from the student in the same way that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| on a textbook that was damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| You know, they will, they will get with the parents and get reimbursement for that repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| And Mr. Norman, Ms. Coatney did pull that up, and it is a new card, just FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| It's not a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Yeah, and this might be for Ms. Baird, but I guess, and this kind of goes to Mr. Norman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| question, a lot of the devices, it seems like, are actually not paid through the system but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| actually paid through funds raised by the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| And, I mean, I'd be curious how much is that, and who does handle the repairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| Is it these same funds that bought them in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| And I'll, if I may, I'll start on that, and I'll let Gail jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| It's not some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Most of them are bought, you know, by funds at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| We dedicate very little centrally in our budget for that, and we do have a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:09| in-house repair team, and, you know, Gail's folks deal with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| I'll let her talk more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Our technician teams are both Dell certified and Apple certified, and what that means is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| they are able to easily access parts from the suppliers, and then we, in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| get reimbursed for the actual labor hours where we do the repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| But, yes, the devices are primarily bought through school student funds or other fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1709)|
| 0:28:37| initiatives, and then the district endeavors to repair them and keep them working as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Any more comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Ms. Birdwalking, a little bit, you do bring up a very good point, Ms. Babb, that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| devices still need to be repaired, and people need to be trained how to use them, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| it is still a cost to our system, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I just want to ask Mr. Oaks to say part of this one more time, because we do have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| folks in the community who are confused about the replacement of technology, and they believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| that we have a huge line item somewhere to replace a whole school's one-to-one technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| and that kind of thing, and they don't realize that that repair budget is for repair, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| it doesn't, it's not enough for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| So if you could explain that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Well, let me see if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| The way most of the technology in the schools is procured is through school fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and donations and the funds that they pull together, and that includes everything from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| whiteboards to computers and a lot of times staff devices that the teachers use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| So they manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| What we really try to do at our level is provide the infrastructure, the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| If the computers were a car, we're providing the highway for them to drive on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| So that's really what we try to do internally, and then through a number of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| try to keep the repairs made on that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| Ms. Byard has a little bit of that in her budget, and then a significant amount of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| is paid for if there is damage to the equipment that is reimbursed to us by the parents or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1838)|
| 0:30:47| the individual who damages the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| So it's, we do a lot of things, I would say, by hook and crook to try to keep them up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| keep them functional and do it as much on the cheap as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Moving right along, under contracts, letter C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Oh, I'm sorry, I think I missed letter B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1868)|
| 0:31:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| We're on contracts B and contracts C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| All right, regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| A, approved tenure for eligible teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| This is always a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Any questions, comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| B, C, D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1902)|
| 0:32:09| All right, so since there were no questions on F, everyone is satisfied with the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| This is what our workshop's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| I guess I would like to just say I really have not had time to go through it in the depth that I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| comfortably discussing it, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| You know, I feel like we went over the overview last week and that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| we did just get the detail, and so I don't know how other board members are feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and hopefully maybe some other ones have more room for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| but just getting it today I really haven't had the chance to go in depth with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| I was going to defer to Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I will agree with Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| We got this in our email at 1230 today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| and that's not a reasonable amount of time to be able to intelligently discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I would like between now and maybe next week for other board members, while I feel like this, again, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| I didn't have time to really go in depth either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| but I did look at the mission statement because the board did ask for another one to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| and I do feel like this one is an improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| but I would just like for other board members to submit their ideas if there's any changes that they want made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| and just quickly reading over it, I wasn't quite sure why the and was between potential and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| It's kind of awkward to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| So I would strike the word and and just say to realize their fullest potential that inspires lifelong learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| but that's a very small point, but we want to send out the best product possible that is grammatically correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2039)|
| 0:34:09| and will pass the hard race test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| So anyway, but thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| and I would like to see some more input into this mission statement so that we get a very good and solid one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| If I could, Dr. Davis, does this go to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| I believe you were the mastermind behind much of this strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| I know that you had a very short window from last week to this week to pull in some of the changes and all that were recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2080)|
| 0:34:49| I think it looks very, very good, and I commend you on the work that you and your staff have put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| Do you have any comments that you'd just like to make on the overall product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2097)|
| 0:35:06| Actually, I can't take full credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I was just a member of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Ms. Corley-Harrington sort of facilitated the group, but the entire senior staff worked together on that and sort of pulled things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| So I was a member of that team, so we all pulled together to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Ms. Harrington, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Yes, and indeed, thanks, Cliff, for Ms. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| I did have a question there regarding in the student achievement section, in that green section there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2138)|
| 0:35:50| under comprehensive and challenging learning opportunities, when we classify a student ready, what is ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2150)|
| 0:36:02| How do we reach that classification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| That might be a question for Dr. Reiswick about our ready graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Is that what you're asking, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| What a ready graduate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Dr. Reiswick, are you the appropriate one for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| I think either one of us can go, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| No, I do know, Mr. Thomas, that this is something that you speak about often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| So please, please take the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| The state looks at a ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| In the past year, that was a 21 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Now, for the current year that we're in and looking, moving forward, that's a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| It could be a score of 21 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| It could also be a combination of the early post-secondary opportunities like the advanced placement or IB courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2210)|
| 0:37:00| dual credit, dual enrollment courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Also, they look at industry certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| So it could be a combination of that as well as a score on the military test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| So there's some different combinations there that a student can achieve if they don't make a 21 on the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| but they can still be categorized as a ready graduate with a combination of the other activities that the state really has defined for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2240)|
| 0:37:33| So, again, early post-secondary opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Again, dual credit, IB courses, dual enrollment, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| Cambridge International, although we don't do Cambridge, some of our schools have expressed an interest in Cambridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| I don't know if that's answering your question, Mr. Norman, or if you're wanting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| No, I'm just trying to think about what that means in terms of, it sounds like 21 is sort of the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2275)|
| 0:38:08| and then for those kids that don't reach 21, we're trying to classify them as ready if they have some other attributes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2288)|
| 0:38:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Early post-secondary opportunities, industry certifications, score on the military test would all factor into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2298)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| For example, I think this year, well, we had roughly our graduation rate was 89%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| but when you looked at ready graduates, I think we're somewhere around 44% if you look at the report card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| So, again, theoretically what we want to strive for is that if we have 90% of our students graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| my goal would be 90% of them be ready graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| So in actuality, I mean, a ready graduate is someone who is either ready to go post-secondary at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| or get a job or be trained to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Or go straight into some kind of internship or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| So the things that we use to classify as ready would fit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I believe I'm correct, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| This is from the State Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| This is an initiative that has been given to us, and these criteria used, Tony, are from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| It's their definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| They determined what a ready graduate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| So, again, this falls in line with what the state requirement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| To that point about basically the definition of a ready graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| maybe we can include kind of a simple definition, which I know it's difficult to be concise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| because of the secondary opportunity and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| But maybe a concise definition, even on this page, might be helpful so that when the community looks at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| they'll understand what we mean by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| And I thought I agree with Ms. Bounds that I thought that transition was a little awkward at the end of the mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| So one suggestion could be realize their fullest potential while inspiring lifelong learning, maybe while inspiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2430)|
| 0:40:42| So that would be my suggestion as if we like this statement, maybe just making that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| And, once again, I said I have not looked at this in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| But as Mr. Norman was pointing out, it's made me look at a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| And on increasing student achievements in the green data part, where we're talking about the ready graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| and percent of graduates participating in advanced academics or dual enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| do we not want to have something tracking our CTE advancement that we're increasing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| And I don't know if there's pros or cons to doing that, but it seems like that seems to be a big thing we're all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| And that doesn't seem included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| Now, one other question I have is in the orange block above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| Well, in the blue block, we're talking about literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| And then in the orange block, it's, you know, the thing is increased student performance on state and national assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| But then when I look at what we're tracking, it's all math except for the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| And I'm just curious about that as to why math is what we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| Mr. Thomas, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| It's Dr. Rasmussen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Currently, science is not, I mean, it's being added in every category, and social studies is not tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| And I think the reason you see the literacy in the first one is because that's called out specifically for literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| We probably could do something around science as far as that goes to and do math and science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| but social studies currently isn't tracked, well, isn't tracked in every grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| So I think it's some consistency there, but we can take a look at which ones would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| But it might be more specific to a course or maybe a grade level because it's not scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| In early grades, things like that, you won't see some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Okay, and I'm more just, it was just kind of curious as to why it was the math versus other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Also, you know, ESSA does, the federal law requires those, you know, the English and the math both to be tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| and tracked, and they're required by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| So those are consistent across the board in every grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| And, again, science and social studies are not in every grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| But we can look at some additional science maybe if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| And I don't know if it is, you know, it might not be appropriate to track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I just more, you know, the first one in the blue block, it was very clear that we were tracking literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| and so it made sense what we were tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| I just wasn't as clear on the orange why it was just the math, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you, board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| I would encourage us to really try to spend some time on this this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| The agenda item reads discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| And I'm hopeful that we can move forward on this, keeping in mind that it is a fluid document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| that at any point in time we're free to go in and amend, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2632)|
| 0:44:04| I believe that completes our agenda, and we move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| Is that correct, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| We have one public forum speaker, Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| Hi, Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| State your name and county, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I'm Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| I prepared two points to make tonight, and now I'm struck by this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| And it's like it's rather frustrating to try and keep up with going on when the strategic plan changes from week to week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2678)|
| 0:44:48| Let me just go on with this and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| You know, I come to you as part of a coalition of community groups that presented this board 10 recommendations on the strategic plan in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| Last week's meeting made it clear to me anyhow that the strategic plan development effort is foundering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| In seven months since the first draft of the strategic plan was released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| the strategic plan has gone from a good start toward a plan to something that reveals neither vision for our schools nor the most basic elements of a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2711)|
| 0:45:27| The superintendent has proposed and the board has accepted three fine directions to take our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| But the general directions do not make a plan any more than saying having fun is an adequate plan for your vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2734)|
| 0:45:43| Plan for a vacation begins with a vision for what you want to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Our strategic plan should begin with a vision of what we want our students to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Unfortunate. Unfortunately, that cannot be discovered in the staff's latest document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| The superintendent at the board's annual retreat in September, the chair made a wise proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| Organize a committee of the board to set a direction for the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| It is the board's strategic plan. It was their understanding and our understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| At the retreat, the staff asked to prepare the next draft of the strategic plan for the board's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| The board agreed and it took four months later for us to have less, not more strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| It seems completely clear to me that the board must provide the vision that the staff lacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| I urge you to take the action, Chairwoman Hill recommended last fall, organize a committee to set the direction for the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2798)|
| 0:46:49| More times than I can remember, I've heard this board lament the lack of community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| Right now, you have a coalition of community groups representing thousands of people asking you to engage on the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2814)|
| 0:47:04| What's more, the coalition wants to engage about things that would be good for all our students and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| not the usual kind of group that shows up just to advocate for their own special interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| While the staff has not been able to articulate a clear vision for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| if you read the coalition's recommendations carefully, you will find an implicit vision for a school focused on the needs of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| And you'll find that their recommendations include most of the elements of an effective strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| All this is to say that if the board takes up the strategic plan as Ms. Hill proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| there is an active coalition of community groups that will provide thoughtful input to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| And if there's a better kind of a community engagement, I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| So, you know, I guess the only other comment I want to add here is that we provided this input on strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| this coalition in September before your retreat, and it has been ignored for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Even this new thing shows no evidence that they took the recommendations or considered them or evaluated them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| or made any effort to incorporate them into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Now, this is not the way to encourage community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| You know, if you want to engage with the community, when the community comes asking, offering to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| provide positive constructive input, the way to do it is to engage with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| So I'm a little bit I am more than a little bit disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| I urge you to to take this strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| You know, it's an important thing. Give it the time it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Even after we've wasted four months with not much happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Let's spend the time it takes to get it right and let's engage with the community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you, Madam Chair. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Just a point of privilege here that I will take to this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2945)|
| 0:49:15| And Lance, you know, I appreciate you. I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| I do take exception, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I have in front of me the list of the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| There were 10 that the coalition presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| And there were certainly, it looks like about seven or eight groups that participated in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| And I know that for all of you to come together and come up with these 10 specific bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| that you wanted to see in the strategic plan was an ordeal in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I sat down with this list provided by this coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| And with one exception, I could pinpoint where every recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| if not worded the same way as in the recommendations of this coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| were mentioned in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| It was not ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| It may not have been as specific, perhaps, as the coalition would have liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| But every single point of these 10 is found, mentioned in this strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3020)|
| 0:50:30| So I just felt it was important to have that on the record because we have not ignored the coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| And I do believe that our committee and our staff has been very diligent in its efforts to try to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| as much as we can into a document that has to be relatively concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| And, again, as I said, it is a fluid document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| So no, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| This was my privilege to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| So I hope that you will look at that and consider that because I do not want the impression to be from this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190212?start=3066)|
