| 2:13:11| So, oh, familiar face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| And when someone moves in rural West Knox County, what's the general water flows or I don't know how to couch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:34| They said there's not enough water for fire, infrastructure for fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| But is that an expectation, I guess is my question, for your clients as you sign folks on in West Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:52| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| John Owings with Robert Snover, Wilson and Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| I was asked to come here today on behalf of the Board of Commissioners of the West Knox Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| as well as its general manager, Mr. Mike Banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| In response to your question, Commissioner, there's always a need for more capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| Certainly in this very area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| West Knox, that's part of West Knox Utilities District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| We're all defined with district boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| We have a certain water flow, 20 pp, 20 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| For answer, pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| I'm not so much into the technicalities of that as I am their legal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| But certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| So are they meeting legal requirements currently with the current population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| So this would only enhance it to deal with the additional growth that these facilities would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| And the gentleman that's developing the property, he came to the West Knox Utility Board, I believe it was a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:02| prior to the recession that we've just gone through, and presented the board with his plans and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:11| And they were certainly in favor of the project from the standpoint of the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:20| We can certainly use all the help that we can get as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| And it certainly helps our rate payers within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| And that was going to be my last point for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| So similar to the county engineering, our roads project, this isn't something, this wasn't a push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| You guys did not identify this segment to say these folks really need additional fire protection and need additional water flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Was it on your lower tier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| It's probably on the lower tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| I mean, I can't answer that absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| But it was brought to us, not, you know, we didn't approach the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| The developer approached us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| Could someone speak to these 1,600 jobs that we talked about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| You know, and I am a proponent of jobs and job growth in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:23| 1,600 jobs, what type of, I see it's broken down here, retail, 579.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| I'm guessing retail is minimum wage plus a dollar or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| And with the manager making, you know, a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| Is that type of retail that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| I can't answer that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| The study has been provided, the complete study, not in the little quick thing that I gave you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| it's been provided to IDB and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| And it has a breakdown based on all the local rates, what's being paid across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8213)|
| 2:17:02| So a couple of things I'd like to see maybe on Monday is maybe a cross cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| It sounds like you've done the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| What's going to be the average per hour or per year or per month salary for these 1,600 jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| I mean, I don't mean to sound mean, but you guys trumped out a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| It's a great number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| But I'd like to see what type of jobs are we talking about with this 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| So I don't know if you can cross cut that or maybe have someone come on Monday that can answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| about the types of jobs that we're talking about in this 1,600 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| You know, Sevier County has a bunch of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| No one's running there to sign on because you're talking about, you know, $1.50 over minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| And I'm not saying that that's what these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| In terms of transportation and things like that, you're out there in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| You're in the richest part of our county per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| So you're not going to get that's not going to be your pool, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| So you're going to have to bring those folks in from another segment of our county or the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| So I just want to make sure that we understand what we're looking at with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| Putting monies in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| And these are good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| But should we, is there better ways for us to spend our dollars, to spend our today dollars, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:31| And I guess, you know, my bottom, I guess, point is I brought up an issue with the red stops, the red steep slope development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:45| In fact, I asked the developers, the police, their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| And I was, maybe rightfully, I don't know, but I was told that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8331)|
| 2:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| And what I'll say, this is to commission, it's our job to set the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| It's not our job to say this part of West Knox County needs additional water flows when the numbers don't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| That's, you know, it's our job to say where should we be putting our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:21| It's not, you know, it is our job to say this isn't a priority road in Knox County in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:31| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| So I'm going to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| And I'm going to say these niceties that will heavily, you know, benefit one project are just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:44| And there will be benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| I'm not saying that there won't be benefit for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| But in terms of a priority, in these times, in these tough times, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:56| So I'll have some more questions on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| Mr. Maddox, thank you for wanting to invest in the fastest growing district in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| You lie within the western boundary of Hardin Valley and the 6th District, almost in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:18| but we're not going to give them that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| So, you know, I'm not one to hand out TIFs for, you know, last TIF was just a reapplication process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:31| And I think it's important that the commission understands that we were just verifying a TIF that was given by a previous commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:38| But it's kind of disheartening to me that this has turned into a geographical socioeconomic warfare right before our very eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:48| Because there's been numerous amounts of economic development dollars given to every district in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:56| And to say that the fastest growing district just so happens to may have some high per capita income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:04| and the rest of the county doesn't deserve anything is offensive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8464)|
| 2:21:12| Everybody complained about Turkey Creek getting a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| Nobody's complaining the $12 million yearly that Turkey Creek is turning over to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| or the city and the county coffers for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| And to take this project and to make it about geographical warfare is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:37| Because, you know, West Knox Utility District is not out seeking developers to enhance their water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:45| That's not their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| Their job is to provide that the best they can at the lowest cost they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| And so it wouldn't be a phone call that West Knox Utility District would make to you for investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:58| And for them to sign on as possibly a half-priced partner says a lot about the need in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8518)|
| 2:22:06| And if you haven't driven that part of the district, I would encourage you to take the Watt Road exit and turn right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:13| and find your-I'm not talking to you, Mr. Max, I'm talking to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| And turn right there and head to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| And you'll see that the economics that you think are there are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| There's single wide trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:28| Of course there's large homes, but there's a lot of single wide trailers and low income families out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| And I take offense to this becoming a class warfare issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| If the estimates on your-Mr. Woodford's estimates are half right, it's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:47| You know, we're still looking at the-at half we're talking 800 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| and at half we're talking $5 million in potential sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| That's, you know, I think the TIF is for $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| And, you know, you're almost-it's like Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| You're almost getting your money back faster than you printed it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| And so a couple of questions I have for you, and I'm not-did you develop Dow Springs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| It just looked very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| The pictures look very familiar and I was just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| In light of your property not being part of-if Ridgetop passes, in light of that, would you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:37| kind of police yourself, I guess, a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| but would you make sure that the reforestation is part of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| I know you want it to look good, but would you make sure that the reforestation is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| very good in that area to make it what it was before somebody stripped it ahead of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| As a matter of fact, the roads that we've started in a different-if you go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| there's not many developments that are in this early stage that are landscaped like we've started on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| We've just started, but you can see some of the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| and a lot of the trees and all that we've planted in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| Another question or point I was going to make before I got sidetracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:20| And I know you can't say-you say you have interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Do you have somebody ready to go in with that groundbreaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| I wanted to address three issues that were discussed here, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| And this, I think, may be a good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| First, I'll come back to that one, but first is the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| And when Ms. Pionkey talked about the studies, they were ten years old and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Those studies were done and looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| That was before Hardin Valley School was in out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| Hardin Valley School is in now, and there are school buses going through there every day, lots of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| and they're running on a little narrow two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| It's one of the highest accident roads in the county with dump trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| And that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| And it was mentioned that, you know, these improvements were for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| This is a partnership, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| I think it would be good for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| And the roads, they just need to be improved, period, and the school kids, if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:22| Secondly, on the utility district, Mr. Owen is maybe not quite as familiar with it as I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:31| because I've been working with West Knox Utilities for several years on several different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| As a matter of fact, I brought one of the newest sewer systems to Knoxville that had never been tried before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| West Knox tried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| At first they didn't like it or didn't think they would like it, but then once it was installed, they love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| And it's one of the sewer systems that they use all through the county now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| So we have a good history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| But there have been plans for years out there to increase the water lines and the sewer lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8751)|
| 2:26:01| There has just not been the funding to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| And this is one of the first projects that has enough weight, I guess you would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| to be able to carry its portion of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| So there is a need for the water and the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| The fire flow, there is none, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| The third thing about the companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| We have, as I mentioned, several different companies very interested in out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| We have some hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| All these businesses that I'm talking about are new businesses to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| not moving anybody from one place to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Several of these are regional draws, drawing people from Rhone County, Loudoun County, Sweetwater, from Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:47| These draws, they're aiming to draw people from Sevierville that stop at 407 up there to come through here to get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:58| The problem with it is every single one, when they look at those roads out there, that kills the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:06| It just absolutely kills the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| It's the roads that are the only ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| They love the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| They love the visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| They love the way the property is developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| They see it's good for their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| But what I try to associate this with is like Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| If you take Lovell Road, Lovell Road used to be a two-lane road also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| And Lovell Road's got two big truck stops on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| Plus it's got all those trucks and everything from Murdoch and all those other roads around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| There's as many trucks on Lovell Road as there is on Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| The problem is on Watt Road there's two lanes, and a truck going across that bridge or going down Everett Road at 15 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:47| will have 30 cars lined up behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| And everybody's mad and disgusted and don't want to use Watt Road anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| Whereas up on Lovell Road they've got six and eight lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| Cars zip on by the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| They don't even hardly pay attention to the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| They just don't even notice them because they get by them quickly and move on to their destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| That's all we're asking for here at Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| That's just what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| And as part of the interstate interchange, TPO is working with Wilbur Smith, who did our road study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| on a study for that intersection at the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| And one of the things that has picked that up was, I'm sure all of you are familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| there was originally going to be the orange route that was going to go up through Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| I live in Hardin Valley, and, you know, that was a situation that was controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:40| Well, that's no longer going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| But if you read the articles and you read the comments from TDOT in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| they said, well, since we're not going to do that, we need to start at I-40-75 split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| and work our way east and improve this interstate to be able to carry this traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| that was going to be carried on the orange route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| And which one's the first one? It's Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| But they need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| The interchange will come as part of the roads that we improve for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:17| The interstate obviously takes longer to get done, but they work together over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:24| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Again, I want to thank you for, I mean, taking the property that was scalped, as Commissioner Norman appropriately put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:35| and doing something that looks very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| And I thank you for putting it in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| I know we've talked about lots of things along the way here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| but I've written down a question that is there any opposition to this in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:57| or is there any opposition that's been verbalized about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| About your project now, not about this TIF, but about your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| I have had zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| The property was already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| It's CB, which is a very good commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| The property is surrounded on a couple of different sides by industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| So, you know, we're not really affecting any homes immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| but it's also the people that I have talked to are glad to have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:32| an entrance into Hardin Valley besides this two-lane road with dump trucks on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| The second thing I believe I get out of this paperwork is that the value of the TIF, $10,800,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9038)|
| 2:30:46| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| The TIF is $6,100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| The $10,800,000 is the tax revenue generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| For how many years, to reemphasize that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| How many years is this recoup going to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| I would like to get Mr. Mamentoff to speak to that, but we've ran a schedule out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:14| and there's a couple of different ways to approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| And maybe I should let Mr. Mamentoff address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| Mr. Maddox asked me, as you all know, I work frequently with TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| and he asked me to help him with the application process and advise him on how to structure a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| Knox County, the Industrial Development Board, and you all have approved policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| There's some of the, and I'm not saying whether this is good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| but some of the most restrictive in the state in terms of the percentage of incremental tax revenues that go toward the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| Forty percent of the incremental tax revenues comes off the top, on top of the debt service component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| So when there is a new development, if this new development occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| not only do you get that portion of the property tax revenues that are used for debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| which I think is somewhere around 12% to 15% of your tax base, but then also you get 40% on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:14| Because of those restrictions, it would not finance the $6.1 million that Mr. Maddox needs within the 15-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:21| that is the standard under the TIF guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| So as part of the resolution that you're being asked to consider, it is asking you to approve a 20-year limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:29| That limit is the limit, which actually is the limit that the Comptroller's Office believes is an acceptable limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:39| one that you do not have to go to them for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| It's been sort of interesting since I was here just a few weeks ago talking to you all a little bit about North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| There is a significant piece of legislature working its way through with the Comptroller's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| and approval on tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| And it's become very, very controversial, surprisingly because they're cutting back on TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9174)|
| 2:33:01| They're cutting them to be used for these purposes only for public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| Because I mentioned to you all before, I wrote the statute under which you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| It does not involve any blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| I know you're all tired of me saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| This is purely an economic development statute, not a blight statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| Although you could argue this one's blighted, but this is a purely economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| And what they are, right now it allows you to go up to 30 years under that statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| and they're going to limit it to 20 if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| And it's going to be quite consistent in many ways with Knox County's policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| allowing TIFs only to be used for public infrastructure, not for on-site grading work, for example, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| And other people across the state are using it much more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| So I know that's a long answer to a relatively short question is how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| Twenty years is what's being asked for, which is five years more than sort of the standard that is presently in the TIF guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| But there is a substantial property tax immediate benefit to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| It's not the entire increment goes toward this project immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:05| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Yes, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| The short answer is 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| There's a background to it, but that's the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| I know how a watch works. Now I know how to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| And then the follow-up of the dollars and the length of time, what specifically are these dollars going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:30| Specifically, they would be used, 4 million roughly would be used to improve Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| from the Watt Road interchange back to the backside of the property to essentially three-lane it with a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:41| And Mr. Maddox can correct me at any point, but it would make Everett safe for that entire distance along the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:50| And roughly another million or so for utility improvements, both electrical, wastewater, gas, sewer, all those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9290)|
| 2:35:02| And you have some capitalized interest during the construction period plus cost of issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| Obviously, we can bring it in under 6.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| That would be wonderful, but that's the high estimate of what it will take to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| And some of that 6.1 is going to be matched by utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| I would probably like to have a one-page sort of look at this come next Monday about where the dollars go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| and who else will be putting up dollars to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| But the 20 years makes it begins to stretch me because you might be able to blame me for the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:41| but after that there's 15 more years it might be tough to blame me because I might not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| So it's just something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| I think I'm going to try to make a non-controversial statement this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| This mostly tries to address the fact I know there's been some about whether we should give county money for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:06| or not give county money for this project or there's now being a disproportionate amount of county money being spent out in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9366)|
| 2:36:15| A TIF really isn't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| And if I state this incorrectly, I really want someone to correct me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| What a TIF is is that there's a loan that's made, and the loan will be paid off by the difference between the present tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:34| and as the tax rate increases, that difference or that increment is used to pay off the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| There's really not any of the taxpayer's money directly that goes into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| because if that project set the way it is for the next 10, 15, 20 years, we would continue to get the present tax receipts from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9405)|
| 2:36:55| But by it improving is that the tax base goes up on it, and it's that increment that it goes up that's used to pay off the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9415)|
| 2:37:03| And only 50 percent of that increment is used to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Roughly 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| And so there's really no tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| There's no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| There's no county money that's really going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| It's just what happens because the value of the property increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| And, of course, you know, we get the added benefit of the sales tax for retail businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| And I did want to clarify one point that I may have misstated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| I said there's no more free money and that this is free money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| What I was really referring to, I should have used the term easy money from private financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| As we all know, a few years ago, when I talked about giving away money, I was, it was really hyperbole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| is that up until a few years ago, the private lending institutions were much too liberal, I think we all agree now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:48| in financing both private, you know, private homes, businesses and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:53| And that's really why we got into a lot of the economic difficulties that we've gotten into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| And now it's difficult even for people that have legitimate loans, legitimate uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| unless it's really collateralized well, is for them to get those type of loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| And what I was really intending to say is it doesn't matter whether we're trying to finance a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:17| or we're looking at ways to make public improvements where the county does not have to accrue more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:25| We could build a new school by borrowing $10 million or $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:30| We could make these improvements by borrowing the county taking on additional debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| and paying interest on that money to make these public improvements out in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| And we can argue about what the priority would be without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| But really what I was trying to say is that we need to look at new and creative ways of financing some of these public projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:52| We're doing it with the Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| We're doing the TIFs a different way than what I would have really been in agreement with several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| And that's just what I wanted to make clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| There's no taxpayer money going to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| It's just the increment in taxes that occur because the property becomes more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| I just wanted to say to Brad that the way I see this, this isn't geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| or geographical warfare or class warfare or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| The fact that this is the fastest growing part of the county makes me question whether a TIF is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:32| that development is going to happen there, whether we give this TIF or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| And the way that I've always looked at TIFs is that you use them in an area that's not growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| or where there's not sufficient development or where there is economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| or physical blight to stimulate that kind of development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:54| And, obviously, this is the fastest growing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| So that's why I have a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9597)|
| 2:40:01| It's not about class or geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| It's about where we're going to put our resources and where we really need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| Can I answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| If you don't want to TIF public projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| then build the infrastructure that necessitates the quality of growth that we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| There's no investment in growth in that district except for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:26| You know, Hardin Valley is the best road out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| And once you get off of that, there's roads that two cars can't pass without stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| So if you don't want to let the developers build it on a TIF, bond the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| let the county build the roads to support the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| It's interesting because it sounds like, from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| that the roads have not been evaluated and prioritized since the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| So I'm just wondering if we're, because we're talking about this being a dangerous road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| I would think that those studies would be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| and that those roads would be at the top of the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| 2000 was your last census, and we didn't have that growth then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| And also the state and the TPO was discussing expanding Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| from Edgemoor Road to Dutchtown Road and also Oak Ridge Highway from Shod Road to Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:24| It sounds like what we need to do is to also ask for a current study be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| on the state of the infrastructure and prioritize these places that obviously need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:38| You can either bond it out now or bond it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| or you can partner with developers and let them build it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:45| Is that something we could put on our agenda for next month, asking for that kind of study be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| I think that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| I won't comment to that point other than to say I really would like to see maybe a more dynamic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9721)|
| 2:42:11| If that's number one, if that's the number one priority, I'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| I'd like to see a study that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| So if that means that we need to put some additional funds in how we spend our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| I mean, because that grows our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| They're not developers' jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| They're our job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| Then we need to get those priorities set correctly and build those roles accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| Mark, could you talk with me a little bit about, since you've authored most of this legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:45| these laws, about that chapter of TIFS, this economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9765)|
| 2:42:54| I mean, you don't have to go into gory detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| But what I'm trying to get is, what were you all thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| What were the crafty proposals that asked you to craft this legislation thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:07| Well, it really wasn't a Dr. Briggs, it's really a different time that we were working in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| At the time, it was much more a go-go economic development time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| where the thought was more taking the incremental property taxes off a large industrial prospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9798)|
| 2:43:25| and using it to buy land or do development for the next prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| That really was what we were originally working on when we started working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| And then it went through the legislature, as I've said before, without really a whole lot of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| And that's why the comptroller's office has sort of come back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| what do we really want TIFS to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| And that's why this debate has been very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| And it's really been interesting that the big four chamber of commerces have all come out against this legislation, limiting TIFS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| They want to see it be used more broadly to be able to incentivize directly prospects to come to counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9835)|
| 2:44:03| and cities for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| Tennessee is woefully lacking in incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| I mean, for better or worse, because we don't have an income tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| use the credits against income tax and the like to attract businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| And TIFS are one of the few economic development tools that people have found to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| So it has morphed into a pretty common tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| Even though I'm not seeing a ton closed, everyone is going after them and trying to use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| and I'm going all over the state talking to various chamber of commerces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| because they want to learn how to use them because they're fighting other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| and cities for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| And where I was thinking it was somewhat being misused, it was really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| people were starting to use it for the actual bricks and mortars for shopping centers and things instead of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| and I personally just as a citizen believed it was not probably the right thing to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:54| And, again, I think this was a middle road approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| I think a huge difference, and, again, I don't mean to butter up Dr. Bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| but I think he hit the key point is when we really had this debate as a community a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:07| and I was sort of in the middle of it, the whole landscape of financing commercial development has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| You just can't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| It used to be fairly easy to tell the developer, oh, you go fix all these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| You know, you can get the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| It's not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| You know, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| You're hard enough to get your construction loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| much less to get the extra money you need to fix all the public infrastructure you're being asked to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9927)|
| 2:45:32| So in many ways it's become like our blighted properties downtown where you can't fill that gap that's needed to take an old building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| and make it into a new without this type of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| Whether you want that type of developer or not, I certainly can understand the sentiment one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| but it's just the world has changed, and this TIF type is a gap that can fill where you really didn't have to fill that gap maybe five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9946)|
| 2:45:56| I think more and more people are finding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| Is this mature enough to be able to say or look and see when a municipality has done enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:13| And I'm not saying we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| Don't jump me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| I'm not saying we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| But, you know, since you've got a lot of experience, there has to be a point where there is enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:25| and maybe we're there downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| But is there a point, you know, that you've seen across the state where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9988)|
| 2:46:35| Well, I think in Memphis they basically gave tax abatement in almost every single downtown development for a period of 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=9995)|
| 2:46:43| They probably did too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| The county finally got fed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| They said, got legislatively fixed that they got to sign off on tax abatements downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| They did too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| What is too much is really hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| I've got a lot of confidence in John Troyer and his ability to monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| You know, it goes to the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| Is it if you dedicate, you know, $600,000, $700,000 of incremental property tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| but derive $10 million of additional other taxes, then you certainly probably haven't done too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| If you've used that money and that doesn't materialize, not such a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| But Mr. Mannix, you know, the money, this TIF has to go to, you still have to go to a bank to borrow the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| You're using a new stream of money, and he's going to, to a large extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| sticking his neck out to guarantee that that increment is going to materialize to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:33| And so, you know, I think that as long as the, because our county is so conservative in a good way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10053)|
| 2:47:41| and essentially a 50-50 split, I think it's going to be a lot harder to say you've done too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| because the county is going to benefit from every single one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| unlike in many counties where they give away the whole farm for 15 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| And I want to ask Mr. Mannix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10079)|
| 2:48:00| I'm sorry, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| Quick for Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| The bank that buys that, is that tax-free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| Is that the same as a municipal bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| It is like a municipal bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| And if you want 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| No, 30 seconds, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| Yes, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| The answer is maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| It just, a lot of it depends on how it's collateralized and what guarantees have to be behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| Usually these TIFs can be converted to tax-exempt debt once they are totally self-supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| So the second geographical question, since we're talking geography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| the fireworks thing across the interstate, is that Loudoun County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| Is that why they can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| That's Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| That's Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| The county line comes across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| Diagonally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| If I may speak for just a second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| We talked a lot about setting priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| My priority number one for our folks is a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| It seems to me that if you don't have a paycheck, you want one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| And we have approximately 1,600 people here who are going to benefit from a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| Now, that means it might be individuals, that might be families that are going to be benefiting from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| It's also, because it's going to be down at Watt Road, this is going to benefit people from Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| other people from Anderson County and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| I know that at Turkey Creek, for example, you've got people from Morgan County who drive in to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| So these folks that come in and take advantage of the restaurants and the retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| they're going to be helping us with our tax stream because they're coming in from out of county because it's right there on the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| Also, as I understand this, and correct me if I'm wrong, 6.1 million is your TIF over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10168)|
| 2:49:35| Now, over that 20-year period, if your figures are correct, we're looking at sales tax revenue of $193.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:45| I'll take that deal all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10187)|
| 2:49:48| So the motion on the floor is to postpone this for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| Without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| We'll send it on without recommendation for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| Until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| Who else said no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| Okay, two voted no for it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| I've been asked for a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| I think that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| We'll come back at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110418part1?start=10210)|
