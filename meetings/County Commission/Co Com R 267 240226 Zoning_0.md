| 0:01:28| or if you're here in opposition and you plan to speak to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=88)|

| 0:01:39| Everyone, please, if you're going to be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=103)|

| 0:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| If there's no objection, I'm going to try a little bit different order on zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| We have five items that were voted on 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| They were consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| I'm going to suggest that we do those first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| and then we will go back to items that had opposition or had speakers at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| If there are any speakers for these consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| though, they will still have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Our order of agenda is going to be item 48, 49, 53, 54, and 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=147)|
| 0:02:42| and then we will come back to the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| So, again, 48, 49, 53, 54, and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=167)|
| 0:03:00| Madam Clerk, would you please proceed with item 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| Item 48 is 1-H-24-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| It's a request of Richard LeMay for rezoning from PR plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=193)|
| 0:03:23| to PR plan residential up to 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| The property is located at 648 Fox Road, parcel ID 144006 in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=208)|
| 0:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Oh, please come forward, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| Would you state your name, please, and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Ray Isaac, 9858 Foote Path Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| I'm on behalf of Richard LeMay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Is there any opposition present for this item or anyone else that would like to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| I see no hands, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Did you want to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| I just want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| You originally were approved for 10 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| You're just jumping it to 12 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| No, actually we were approved for 12 to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| but then there were some mistakes in the plot calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| and the commission, you approved 12 units to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| But then they found a mistake, so now they're trying to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Okay, it's just a clean-up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Director Brooks, would you please read the recommendation of the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| The Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR plan residential zone up to 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| joint use per acre because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development by a vote of 14 to 0 in consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| You have already been asked to speak to your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Was there anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Any comments or questions from fellow commissioners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Seeing none, hold on one second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| I'll look to Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| I tried to reach out to Mr. LeMay a couple of times because I was curious about the project, and I haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| So do you want to explain anything about the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| In terms of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| What your plans are for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| It's a single family home, 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| What I have done with the last one that came on Fox Road is I actually only approved three dwelling units an acre because of Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=362)|
| 0:06:12| So I think that that's where I'm more comfortable of being at three acres, three dwelling units an acre instead of the 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=372)|
| 0:06:22| So I will make a motion to approve the PR zone up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=382)|
| 0:06:33| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| We have a motion by Oster, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| These lots are already platted and the road is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| I think what's happened here, because it was only a property that had 3.4 acres, they were originally given the opportunity because they thought the acreage was larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:07:03| They only went for three units an acre, which gave them 12 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Now they realize with the final plat, the acreage has been reduced, and they were originally obviously given the 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:17| So you've already got the, do you have the water and sewers already in for 12 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| Everything connected to 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| That's the dilemma we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| And the county office already approved it before for 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| So everything going on until they discover there is some error, but everybody involved in the error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| So now it's going to be a devastating thing not to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| That's why it's a really good idea if a commissioner reaches out to the applicant to get back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| Because I really shouldn't have to be reaching out to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| You should be reaching out to me or having your representative reach out to me so that there's not this communication problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| So I will pull my motion back and amend it that I will approve the PR zone up to three and a half dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=480)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Commissioner Frazier, are you still all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=504)|

| 0:16:17| The F, Floodway area will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=977)|

| 0:16:25| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Yeah, we've currently gotten some of our plans back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| On January 11th, it was recommended that we do four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| We're actually going to be closer to about two and a half, three, given the current plans we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| I've reached out to a few people that live in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| After running through the plans with them, they seem pretty happy to see the future work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1006)|

| 0:16:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| So are these going to be single-family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I left too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Yeah, it's going to be single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| I just don't like to approve that many dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| I'd make a motion to approve two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Motion by Lee, second by Frazier, to approve two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| Are there any questions or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| You said you were only going to do two to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Currently, as it states right now, the plans that we have is about 2.6, what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| Planning recommended up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| The current plans, given the topography of the overall site, are able to get two and a half to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| That's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| So no more than three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| I just want to make sure I'm clear that you went through staff planning and planning commission and both came out at three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1091)|
| 0:18:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| The recommendation was four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Four units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| And you're wanting to come in under the recommendation at three units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| I'm just saying that's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I was great with the recommendation of four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Just the way that it boiled down now is three, and I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Your district commissioner just made a motion for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| So it's been cut in half from where you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| You know, when we go through these processes, we go through them trying to figure out every piece of land is different, every property is different, every development is financially viable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:19:00| And it's sort of an unusual request to go down from where you were approved at the beginning, much less than it being halved as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1140)|
| 0:19:11| I just want to make sure you have an opportunity to express that, because if it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Well, do I have the right to object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Oh, yeah, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| This is your thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| So I'm just – I want you to understand, like, there's a motion on the floor to do half of what you started out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| And if it's not viable for you, you need to speak up, because it's – and your commissioner may have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| I just want to give you an opportunity to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| In that case, I do object to the two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Well, I've had some opposition from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Hold on, hold on, please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Let me call on Commissioner Frazier, and I will circle back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I just wanted to point out that the proposed future land use map has this parcel classified as rural conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| and that is based on aligning this parcel with existing development in the area to maintain the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1195)|
| 0:20:05| Also, it's concerning that the average daily vehicle trips that your proposed project would produce is 2,700 daily vehicle trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1205)|
| 0:20:18| So I just wanted to point that out, and that is why I supported Commissioner Lee's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1218)|
| 0:20:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Mr. Snowden, what will be the access point to this subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| There's an existing access point that I believe, Mr. Kelly, is going to come out at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| There's a culvert there that we think the state may have built for access to that private property some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| And if you can kind of see it on KJS, it looks like it lines up with – let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:21:02| Just a little bit south of where relocated tail mine it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So our department didn't have any concerns with the access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| So it will be on Maynardville Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| My motion still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| The motion I make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Did you have anything else to say toward this, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Anything additional beyond the abject of the two units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Just a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Commissioner Frazier, you're saying that on the comprehensive land use plan that's publicized by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| this is in the – could you repeat that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| And that allows how many units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| We'll defer to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Can you ask that question one more time, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| This property is classified under the new comprehensive land use plan that's going to take effect here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| So if it's under rural conservation, what is the designation number of units per acre that it's allowed under that designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:37| It's still in the planned growth area, so it would allow up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Consideration of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| We have a motion on the floor at two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1376)|
| 0:23:06| Commissioner Wolford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| So say we do pass the plan and everything, can he just come back and get his three units an acre at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| So in the planned growth area, I was still thinking three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| It does allow – because it's in the planned growth area, it allows consideration of more than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| It's not limited by the rural area of the proposed growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| So it currently could be considered up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Does that answer your question, Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| So after the new plan gets put through, he can come back and get up to five units an acre because that's what's allowed in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| In the future, in theory, if everything gets passed, then blah, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| They could come back and request additional density under the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Once it gets up to five units an acre in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Well, currently they could request up to five now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| What happens if we pass the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Would they be at three or would they be at five in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| That's what I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Well, it depends on what's approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| The zoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| The zoning is not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| They would still have to – so if the future land use map is adopted, the rural conservation place type would be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:24| But the zoning is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So if they wanted to make any additional changes to their zoning, they would have to come back before the planning commission in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| I think you're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| The question was if the rural – what is it going to be, two units in the future, regardless of what this is zoned now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| No, it's currently in the planned growth area and is going to stay in the planned growth area if the plans move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| Okay, so I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| It's a piece that's in planned growth that is designated as rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| In the future land use map that you all have not considered yet and the planning commission has not yet voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| the place type designated for this property is proposed to be rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| With your basically 60 acres, you've plotted it out and you can do 2.6 homes per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| And you've kind of filled in all the gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| That number would work for you then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I'll make a substitute motion to approve a 2.6 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| We have a substitute motion on the floor by Jay, seconded by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Is there any discussion on this substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Commissioner Durrett, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| What would the, well, before the substitute motion at 2 units per acre, how would that affect your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| If we dropped it down to the 2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| It would kind of bust our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| It wouldn't bust the budget, but looking at things from the whole perspective and development costs allocated to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| there's a certain number that we have to reach, and if we keep bumping down closer to 2, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| how close can we get to that number before the whole deal blows up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| So that's really what I take in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Ultimately, the design that we have right now is at 2.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| That's what works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Anything less than that, I just can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Mr. Kelly, what is the general price point of the homes that you're going to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| The range, broad range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I know it changes on the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I would say that we're looking at a range between $350,000 to $415,000, $420,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| So the reason I made the substitute motion is to keep, we talk about needing affordable housing, and there's only two types of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| government-subsidized and government-built housing, or houses that are more affordable for everyone across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| And the reason I made the substitute motion to try to find, I think it's a reasonable compromise to go from 4 down to 2.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:28:00| is to try to keep it more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| If it goes lower than that, you're going to have to charge more for the same general houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| We're talking about probably not more than a few different units different, but your costs are going to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| and it's going to be more unaffordable for people to buy that first home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| We heard earlier, and we've been given reports in the past that shows how hard it is to buy a $350,000 to $450,000 home right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:29| just for the average teacher, police, fireman, but just anybody in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| And so I'm always trying to find more opportunities to keep it more affordable, and that's why I made the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you. Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you, Madam Chair. So you don't know what the cost difference would be between 2 versus 2.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| I don't have that exact number, and I really don't want to misquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Moyers, is it advisable for this body to ask about price points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| Okay. I can't give you a legal answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| I can't tell you what's advisable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| I'm here as your legal advisor. You're talking about a question of policy rather than law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| It's not illegal to ask about price points, if that's what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| But have we not been encouraged to not ask about price points so that it does not influence our decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Well, I don't know. I don't believe that I've suggested that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| I don't know what happened before I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| When you make these decisions, you're taking everything into account, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and that's one consideration you can legally, you know, have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| You can take considerations of the surrounding neighborhood, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| You know, it's all sort of a holistic way that you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| And, you know, when we keep talking about growth and what's happening in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| what's happened to house prices, that is a legitimate thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| But it's certainly not the only thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| You have to take in all the factors that would be appropriate in making a decision about whether or not to rezone and at what density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| And if you believe that higher density leads to a lower price, then you can take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| I don't know, you know, what the evidence, no evidence necessarily has been presented for that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| but it is something you can consider, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| I would say that the biggest thing that matters to me is what the people in my district want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| and they don't want that many houses on that many, on the acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| And so what the people want matters to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| We're going to have an election here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| We're going to have seven commissioner seats that are going to be open here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| Five people on this commission won't be back in a few months because they're either term limited or have chose not to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| So I think that when we ignore what the people in the district want, we're in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| because I think what the community wants is important too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| So that's what my decision is of why I only want two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| We have a substitute motion on the floor at 2.6 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Motion at 2.6 per acre passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Good luck with your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1921)|

| 0:32:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| I do see some opposition out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Is there any consistency or plan on the speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| I can give you all a total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Who will be speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| So each side has ten minutes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| I will give you ten minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Before you speak, Mr. Mullins, I will get the recommendation of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR Plan Residential Zone up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development by vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| The floor is yours, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Thank you, Madam Chair, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Ben Mullins here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| This is a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| It is 42.44 acres in southwest Knox County off South North Shore Drive between the Choteau roundabout and the Loudoun County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2018)|
| 0:33:49| It has access to both South North Shore Drive and Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| The original application for this was an application for rezoning to planned residential at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| Staff, when they considered this application and they looked at the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| what the surrounding development was built out at, what the surrounding development had been zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| what the current plan growth policy plan calls for, the planned growth area, and what the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| the low-density residential sector plan, which allows consideration for up to five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| they made a recommendation that this property would be appropriate at three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| which if you look at a one-mile radius at the properties that have already been developed in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| they are built out at approximately 3.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| So it is consistent with what is presently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| It's consistent with the sector plan that has been in place since 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| It's consistent with the growth policy plan that has been in place for 24 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| and it's consistent with the proposed growth policy plan that this body is considering tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| And with all of those factors in mind, we, as the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| accepts staff's recommendation at three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| and that is, in fact, what Planning Commission did vote to recommend by 14-0 for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| I know there's a lot of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| There are problems with South North Shore Drive and the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| specifically from the Concord roundabout to the Choteau roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| That's the most heavily traveled portion of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| And there are plans that Director Snowden can illuminate on to modernize and widen that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| The section that we're talking about here between the Choteau roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| and Harvey Road has significantly less traffic on it currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| It's 4,800 cars per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| The traffic accident rate in that stretch of the road is below the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| But, again, this is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Once we have the rezoning in place for three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| we'll have to move forward with a development plan and a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| where there will be a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Now, I know there's some skepticism on what that traffic impact analysis may or may not reveal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| but with a level of scrutiny on this, I know Mr. Snowden is going to really look at what the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| that we're going to cause on this stretch of south-north shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| and make us contribute in mitigating those impacts, which is what the legal standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| We can't fix problems that are existing, but we can't make them worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| And what we can be called to do is participate in improvements to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| that are going to mitigate from the impact roughly proportional to the impact that we're going to cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| And that will happen once we move forward with the traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| I think this meets all the factors that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| When we're making a decision, Tennessee does have strong property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| You have a lot of discretion in making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| As Mr. Moyers just talked about, you can take everything into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| but you still have to follow the existing standards that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And the existing standards in place all call for this property to be considered at low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| And three dwelling units an acre is right in the middle of that low-density residential factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| And it also is consistent with what is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| I know we have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I want to reserve about five minutes of my time for rebuttal following what the opposition says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| But when you have opposition like this, when the people that are in the existing neighborhoods now say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| enough's enough, we don't want any more, it kind of reminds me of the Ronald Reagan quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| The people that are opposed to this already have their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| They're already living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| The farm that they want to call this has not been farmed for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| It's been a vacant field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Harvey has wanted to sell this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| This is an opportunity where he can recoup the investment he has on this property in a way that is respectful to the existing plans that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| So for that, I would ask that you follow staff's recommendation, follow Planning Commission's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| and approve this at PR at three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Spokesperson for the opposition, your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| Good evening, Madam Chair, esteemed members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| My name is Mike Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I live at 716 Bricksworth Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| There are people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| You can see them behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| And I hold here the 567 comments that they made to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And I want to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Adding more traffic to the roads in Choteau will undoubtedly lead to loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| Traffic is no longer a minor inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| It is literally a matter of life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Consider the alarming statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| The crash rate on North Shore Drive between Choteau and Concord is already above the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Accidents along the North Shore corridor have increased a staggering 39% in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Tragically, we have witnessed at least two fatal accidents in as many years, claiming the lives of Suzanne Russell and Janet Guzman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| Commissioner Larson Jay has aptly pointed out that most of these accidents occur during daylight hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| in clear weather conditions, and along the roadway not near an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| Rear-end collisions account for nearly a third of the reported accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| and are undoubtedly fueled by the increased volume of traffic congesting our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| This dangerous condition has been fostered by the allowance of increased population density in Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| without necessary road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Fifty-three years ago I used to ride my motorcycle down North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and nothing has changed there except for two roundabouts, a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| and now we're going to get two feet per lane widened on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| Each time we raise concerns about increased traffic from proposed rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| we are met with promises of a traffic analysis at some distant point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| The county adopted traffic endpoint guidelines back in 1995,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| along then with the development of Montgomery Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Since then, the growth has been steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Here are the following subdivisions since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Jefferson Park, Harpers Cove, Mallard Bay Unit 1, Mallard Bay Unit 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| the livery, the woods at Montgomery Cove, Choteau Landing, Bayou Bend, Harper Crest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| Lake Cove, Ferris Property, Choteau Meadows, Choteau Mill, the woods, Shady Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| All of that since 1995 and hardly anything has been done to the east-west connector to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| My little sister almost died in 1976 at North Shore and Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| The consequence of overdevelopment extended beyond just traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| I'll share a personal anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| A close friend of mine faced harrowing circumstances when he went to UT emergency room in December of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| Despite the fact that he had an urgent need for medical attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| he was left untreated for 17 1⁄2 hours and then he had a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| And they gave him a stent and he lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Had they reached him in less than 17 1⁄2 hours, he would not have had a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| The public safety issue here is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| There's also evidence that we're facing an imminent tax increase as single family residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| fail to generate enough tax revenue to support the necessary infrastructure and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| So we have now gotten, by kicking the can down the road, we're behind the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| It's going to be a cash problem to fix these roads of North Shore, Choteau and Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| Every new residential subdivision places existing additional strain on the county infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| exacerbating the already precarious situation we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| As many of you are running for re-election, you should keep in mind that promises have been made repeatedly to widen North Shore Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| I remember in this body in the early 2000s when District 5 had three commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| Mike Hammond, Craig Luthold and John Greese talked about four-laning North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| It's time to move beyond empty promises of future road improvements and another useless traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| So what can we do as we face this crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| We must demand action from our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| First, the most effective action would be to deny this rezoning and others like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| until the crash rate on North Shore Drive is no longer above the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Therefore, I urge this commission to stand on public health and safety and fiscal responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Deny the requested rezoning and any others like it in this area until our roads are made safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| and the crash rate for North Shore Drive falls below the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| The time for action is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Let's prioritize the lives and well-being of our community above the developers' quest for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:36| Mr. Mullins, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I'm sorry, I didn't know. Is Mike the only speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| I do want to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| I appreciate the time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| I do appreciate them mentioning Commissioner Jay's letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| and that letter was to Mayor Jacobs on September 1, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I have read that letter, and I appreciate, Commissioner Jay, what you're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| You're calling for there to be even more roundabouts in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| because those roundabouts are traffic calming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| and help alleviate the types of accidents that you're seeing on that stretch of South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| I don't believe you're calling for a moratorium for any development on South North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| and that's the way that has been represented throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| I would like to ask Director Snowden if he's able to talk about the planned improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:43| along the stretch of South North Shore Drive between the Concord roundabout and the Choteau roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| and what the purpose of that is in light of the crash data in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Yeah, as part of the – there's been multiple commissioners involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Jay have been advocates for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| As part of the budget that was announced last year by Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| we did want to modernize North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| The two and a half miles from or essentially between the roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| everything to the east of the Concord roundabout is a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| so Knox County does not maintain that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| But everything to the west is a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| And the two and a half miles that these folks have said does have an elevated crash rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| does have higher traffic volumes, and there's lane widths there that vary between 10 and 11 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| shoulders that are nonexistent, zero to two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| There's some deficiencies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| And so what we have chosen to do that actually right-of-way acquisitions will be in front of this body next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| is to make those two and a half miles from roundabout to roundabout at Concord to North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| is to make that roadway a minimum of 11 foot lanes in each direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| have minimum two foot paved shoulders, have centerline rumble strips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| edgeline rumble strips, those operational safety improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| In addition to, if you'll notice, a lot of those areas, there's a steep drop off right at the edge of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| And what we're going to do is install four to one or relatively flat four slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| So if somebody does get slightly off, even off the wider lanes and the wider shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| they will have a slope in which they can get off and drive back onto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| It's traversable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| So there's a big change there that we think is caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| We see the accidents are related to maybe some inattentive drivers that just don't have the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| they look down and they get off the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| So we do believe those improvements will improve a lot of that safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| In addition, there is some outdated guardrail out there in that one embayment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| We'll be installing new guardrail, new end treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| So this project we anticipate probably start later this summer, probably take eight to 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| So it would be worst case completed in the summer of 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| It's an important project that we're hopeful can get started soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| and really mitigate some of these safety concerns that you've heard about tonight from the citizens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| I appreciate you telling commission about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| And I guess the goal of that is, as I understood from your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| is to make sure that the crash rate along this section of South North Shore is actually falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| then below the state average for that crash rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| And you've identified these plans, although they, you know, are not a four-lane highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| but by modernizing the road, by widening the road to the extent they plan to widen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| and by improving these shoulders is anticipated to bring the crash rate down below what the state average is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| And the crash rate along the section of South North Shore drop between Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| and Harvey Lane is currently below the state average as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| But there's also quite a bit of frontage of this property along South North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| and I anticipate that there will be an opportunity when we get to the development plan phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| to be able to improve that section as well and participate in the improvements in that section as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| And, again, that is something that's not decided now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| That's something that is decided when we move forward because this is a planned zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| and it will require a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| So, again, this meets the standards that we have in place that we are bound by law to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| and I would appreciate that if you would follow Planning Commission's recommendation and vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| And, Mr. Mitchell, in fairness, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2943)|
| 0:49:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| I just want to point out that people don't, until you live through this, you don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2955)|
| 0:49:25| I live on Turkey Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| It doesn't take much to lock up North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| An accident can cause a backup for miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| And then these people come down Choteau and Harvey, and they come to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| The problem is what happens when a tree fell down, blocked two lanes of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2981)|
| 0:49:49| and the emergency people could not get there to cut the tree up and move it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| What happens if you live in one of these Choteau communities and a loved one has a heart attack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| How are they supposed to get emergency services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| This is a public safety and health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| And I remember in this body talking about four-laning North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| and I appreciate what Mr. Snowden said, but it's still not going to be, even when it's widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| it's still going to get log jammed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| How do you get a fire truck, a sheriff's deputy, emergency medical services when you just can't get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| I understand that we're standing here and we're saying enough is enough, and that's a little hard for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:42| But at what point do we draw a line in the sand and say that public health and safety is paramount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| Commissioners, I did not see whose light was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I want to thank Ben Mullins and Mr. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I don't think he's here for meeting with a few of us and the members of the community recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| We always welcome and encourage engagement from the applicant with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| So I appreciate you sharing your time with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And I want to say I'm not opposed to development and I'm not opposed to the development of this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| In my opinion, the staff recommendation, it does align and form and character based on the current lane use classification and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| However, the proposed place type for this area, as proposed today, is to rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:51| And so that will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| That will change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| So because of the proposed lane use classification of rural living and a forthcoming road safety improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| what I can't support is the timing of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| Road improvements to address the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| They're slated to begin late summer 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| I have seen and lived how over 2000 daily vehicle trips negatively impacts safety and congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| And I would feel personally irresponsible adding that many vehicles before making the planned much needed road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:37| So I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| Commissioner J. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| I just want to my my letter has been used, I'd say, by every side that has an opinion in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:53:01| However, they seem wish. And I'm not I'm not exactly sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| I'm pretty sure I copied all of you all on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| But if I didn't, I'm happy to supply a copy to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| This was in relation to a previous development that had strong opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| And I'm someone who tries to find solutions instead of just saying no or it's not going to happen or we all get to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3197)|
| 0:53:27| And and I'm just I'm not a believer in pulling up the drawbridge and and saying, I got mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And you all can, you know, forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I just we're not it's not the reality of where we are as a growing county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| So I tried to present to Mayor Jacobson and Mr. Snowden some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| How could we improve it? And and that was with additional roundabouts, which I do think will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And I think is a a logical solution for so many parts of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| But those things cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| And as much as and we're going to talk about this when we get back to our other meeting and talk about the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| But as much as everybody has said the same thing and will and have for the last six years I've been here and probably will be for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3246)|
| 0:54:16| Is we are so inadequately investing in our infrastructure and we have and we've made that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3256)|
| 0:54:24| This everyone in this room and everyone in this county collectively for 25 years has made that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| We're all part of it. So it's not just us versus you or you versus the farmers or farmers versus the next neighborhood or neighborhood versus neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| We've collectively elected representatives that said we're never going to keep up with revenue costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| We're never going to keep up with expenses in this county. We're never going to build more stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| We're never going to expand and grow. And we're talking about a growth plan that they never adopt, never kept up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| And I and I do commend Mayor Jacobs for finally putting a flag in the ground and saying we've got to catch up at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| We've got to have a plan. Our former colleague of Amy Brooks, as he was walking out the door, so adequately said, you know, per the old Beatles song,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3301)|
| 0:55:12| if you have if you don't know where you're going, then any road will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And we have never stopped and said this is where we're going. But this is how North Shore became North Shore in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| When you rode your motorcycle down there, there weren't any neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| But every neighborhood after every neighborhood and many of you, including people I know in that area, all decided, yes, I want to buy my house in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| And I'm OK with it. And I'm OK contributing to more traffic. And I'm OK with the next person and the next person and the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| And I'm also OK not investing in infrastructure. We've all collectively made that decision together and it's been inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| And so literally the very first project I ever worked on as commissioner six and a half years ago, before I was even sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| was this area when I saw a young family trying to get to the park in the ditch, dodging cars with no access to their own public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:56:05| And for six years, I've worked side by side with Commissioner Schoonmaker, Mr. Snowden, to build improvements to pedestrian safety, to improve shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3365)|
| 0:56:15| which we've done to advocate with TDOT to put in more infrastructure, which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| And now it is unbelievable that the project that Mr. Snowden outlined is two and a half to three million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:30| Tell me one other place of a two mile stretch in this county are we spending three million dollars on infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| I'll wait all night because the answer is zero. And I point that out because in a 20 million dollar road budget for half a million people and 535 square miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3397)|
| 0:56:50| we're never going to catch up. And at some point this community has to have an honest conversation about that. And this commission does, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| In the meantime, we're in a chicken and egg scenario every single time we come up here to vote. Every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| If you don't have growth, you don't have a revenue. And if you're the only two things you're doing in any business, you're growing or dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| I'd rather be growing than dying all day long. But you can't have growth without the infrastructure. You can't have infrastructure without the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| So what do you do? You do your best to keep up with as much as you can, when you can, with the resources you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| And I'm a huge proponent that we ought to be putting a hundred times more resources into our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| But the financial reality is that this community has chosen not to do that. And so maybe we will one day. Maybe we'll decide to buckle down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| In the meantime, I'm a huge believer in personal property rights. And I looked up that while we were having this discussion earlier, I looked up this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3461)|
| 0:57:51| The Harvey family has owned this parcel since 1906. 1906. And I bet you at one point, way back when, it really was a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| It was a working farm that produced hay or cattle or whatever. I don't know the Harvey family, but I imagine that that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| So for 118 years, the Harvey family has worked this land, has maintained this land, and have paid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| Do they not have any rights? Who wants to tell the farmer or the next person down that they don't have a right to their land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:25| They don't have a right to the value of that. They don't have a right to pay for their kid's college fund or their grandkid's education or their senior housing or their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| Why don't they have rights too? And I think we lose that. We always point at the greedy developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| You either want government housing, which I know you don't want. I know you don't want because we went through that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| So you either want government subsidized housing or you want free market housing that's more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| And the only way to get free market housing that's more affordable is to have more inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| This is economics 101 and supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| So we are growing at Knox County whether we like it or not. And water is going to flow where water is going to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| And it's our job to manage it the best we can. But people are going to come here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| And if the status quo is do nothing and put our head in the sand and say oh well and wait for the infrastructure to catch up, we're not going to do anything ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3550)|
| 0:59:19| We're going to just stop and it's going to be more unaffordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| And so this is a perfect example of where somebody has a right to their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Somebody has a right to build houses that we will move in just like the ones you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And we are going to do our best to catch up with the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Should North Shore Drive be widened? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Okay. But let's go tell the five subdivisions to put their entrance into the right of way into the public land that we're about to chop off half their barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3578)|
| 0:59:48| Let's see how that goes. We've had that discussion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| It's not going to be pretty but it is going to be incremental and natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| So I think that this is a reasonable compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| It was started at five. Three is just like every other neighborhood in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| We're going to do as much as we can to invest and I hope we invest more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| I would hope that we can invest more in roundabouts and more widening and everything else that every concern has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| We just have to decide if we want to pay for it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| So we can't say we don't want to pay for it and then complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| We've got to be part of a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| I'm happy to support three units an acre because I think it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| I also think it's legal and I also think the Harvey family has some rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3629)|
| 1:00:38| I agree. I support totally what Commissioner Frazier is saying for all the reasons that she's saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| I support all the people that turned out tonight and all the people that have emailed and reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| I disagree with what Commissioner Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Because I think we're not listening to the people that it affects every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And these people matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| And all we hear is growth, growth, growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| I think we need to push back and not grow so fast when it affects people's lives, people's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| So I cannot approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker, if I may ask a question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| Oh, absolutely. I'd rather be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Mr. Mullins, do you know at this point if there is an immediate plan to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| There's not an immediate plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| To Commissioner Frazier's point about the timing, I don't know what that timing for the build will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| We don't have a development plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| And so I suspect it would take some time to get that together, get that through the process and get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| And the timeframe between whenever we are moving forward with this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| and the improvements to South North Shore Drive are going to be really compressed, if not close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| Based upon the estimates I've heard Director Snowden give is when they want to start that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| And to follow up with you, Mr. Snowden, I really appreciate what you're trying to do out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:25| And I heard you say that you anticipated roughly by the summer of 2025 it would be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3745)|
| 1:02:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| That's our current estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| So the improvement probably will be done before any traffic, measurable traffic anyway, would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3760)|
| 1:02:55| I have to say I tend to agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| I, too, am a huge property rights proponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| And the development along North Shore, it's, you know, we are just in this chicken and egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:14| Like you said, it's always all right for you, but it's not okay for the next guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| And I promise you if any of you were sitting out there with that kind of property in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| and someone was trying to tell you what you could not do with it, not one of you would be happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| So for that reason, I do think that this is a reasonable compromise, the three per acre, and I will be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:42| Commissioner, anyone else like to speak before Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| A question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| My question is, are there any additional requirements associated with the PR zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Will they have to bring anything back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Yes, this is only the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| So if it is rezoned to plan residential, they will have to create a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| and come back before the Planning Commission for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair, Commissioners, if you'll allow me a little professional courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| I'd like to read a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| You know, as a commissioner, I've always had a very, very soft spot for the residents of the Choteau community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| because our family has so many friends out there, and because as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| I've gotten to have more friends because I represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| You know, I was the one that stood up and prevented a pill mill from being located on the roundabout at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:05:03| You know, that illegal facility would have brought really just an undesirable element to the Choteau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:13| You know, and I was the one that initially alerted the Choteau community to the Choteau landing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3913)|
| 1:05:22| which was the Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Nobody was aware of that until I brought it to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| And, you know, I've been well aware of the traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Let me back up a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Also, when this issue came before rezoning, the Harvey Road project at 1620 Harvey Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| I reached out to the leaders of the Choteau community to make sure that they were aware of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and had all the proper information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| In fact, I attended the NOx planning meeting and sat with the members of the Choteau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:06:02| And so, you know, I'm also the one along with Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| but I actually sat down on these traffic improvements with Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| and we were able to work out a $2 million budget item for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| So over this time period, I've been trying to do several safety improvements to the North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| So I'm a little frustrated because about four days, five days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| a small fringe group of Choteau residents hired an out-of-state PR firm, I guess, to, you know, to intimidate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=3992)|
| 1:06:44| And as my colleagues know, John Schoonmaker cannot be bullied or intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| So that tactic didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| But I guess I was a little surprised that they'd hire an out-of-state firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| when we have such good PR firms here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| So even though that's transpired, I'm not going to give up my responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| to represent the residents of the Choteau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| I'm still going to work for them until August 31st of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| So if my colleagues could go to their computer and go to the knoxcounty.org website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4036)|
| 1:07:24| which is Mayor Jacobs' homepage, I'd like you to look at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| You see on the tab where it says Advanced Knox, if you click on Final Plan Available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| and you go down to where the green tab says Interactive Map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Am I going too fast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| And you pull up the map of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| These are all the new land use classifications that we're going to approve here in the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4068)|
| 1:07:57| If you can zoom in to the Choteau area, which is the southwest corner of that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:08:06| and you're going to have to do a really good zoom job, if you'll notice on that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| that the property in question that we're talking about tonight is classified as rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4093)|
| 1:08:23| which under that category, with all the other property south of North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| is limited to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| So if we believe in what we're getting ready to approve here shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| which is our comprehensive land use plan, and we don't follow what we've already got in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| and it's been in the works for months now, as Commissioner Beeler said during the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| if we don't believe in it, then what are we doing here, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve this rezoning at two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| based on the proposed comprehensive land use plan that's provided for us by the Knox County Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4147)|
| 1:09:20| We have a motion on the floor for two units per acre by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Second by Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Director Brooks, Commissioner Schoonmaker just brought us a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Director Brooks, Commissioner Schoonmaker just brought us our attention to the interactive map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| We received an email from you about an update to our comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| Are those updates added already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| They are? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| And, Mr. Mullins, so your original ask was five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| You are okay with three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| We are fine with three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| How does that, and forgive me because this is so new and I'm still learning all of the place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| what is the density for rural living in the new proposed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| If the comprehensive plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| there are a number of different zones that can be considered for the rural living place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| and one of them is planned residential up to one to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm on the map and I'm struggling to, while I find Harvey Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| I'm struggling to find the intersection of North Shore Drive and Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| Are you referring to the striped blue areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Yeah, you have to really zoom in close to actually see all of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| Harvey Road is actually, it's on about the third or fourth stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| You can actually see where it says Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| And this is the raw land that's now been incorporated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| including this south side of North Shore Drive in the Choteau Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| Are you finished, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| What? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| We have a proper motion and second on the floor for development at two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:14| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Let's, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Yes, we will do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Madam Chair, if you wouldn't mind to repeat the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Motion on the floor is residential development at two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4355)|
| 1:12:46| Per the future map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Chairwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Did I hear someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| I just want to provide some additional clarification because I know that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| this is, it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| The future land use map, the plan that has not been adopted or considered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Planning Commission or County Commission yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| does not in this particular area determine density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| That is determined by the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| So I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| So this place type does not limit the density per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| There are a number of different zones that can be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| just like today in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| And the LDR, for example, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| So a correct wording, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker would be approve development at two units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| So are you agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Yes, but I think I need a clarification on what she's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| because the mayor's office is saying something different to what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Because you're saying they're saying everything in the Choteau Peninsula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| south of North Shore will be the max is two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| So you're saying that doesn't fly if the comprehensive land use plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| I'm just trying to make sure that you all understand the distinction between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| the place types and zoning itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| So the place types allow consideration of a number of different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| One is which is PR and currently that place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| That zoning PR plan is a zone one to two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| It is very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I just want to be clear that the place type in and of itself does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| limit dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| It has to be attached to that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| Would you identify yourself, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Mandy Benedict mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| I think you're referring to the rural area for the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| We did not change that to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| We changed the place types on those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| But what would be the zoning then for those parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| We don't have the new zoning for those parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| but it would be created through the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| That's the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| Did you have some more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Oh, I just heard you speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| Mr. Mullins, briefly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Well, I just want to make sure I'm on the same page with commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| with the mayor's office and with planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| The rural living place type does not assign density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| It allows there to be a number of different zones that could be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| The only zone that referenced density is the PR1 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| However, since this is still in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| it can still consider densities for different zones up to five units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| So the density isn't artificially restricted just by this place type yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| until that zoning map gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| So I just want to make sure that it being designated rural living by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| itself, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| does not restrict the density to essentially converting this from a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| growth area to a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| So I want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I think with what's built out there, three units an acre is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4588)|

| 1:16:39| I'll start with Derek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Mr. Lundy started with only one ordinance and that's the only roll call that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| So I'll start with Derek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Derek, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Yes, in our rotation of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| And then we really are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I just had a question for commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=4627)|

| 1:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Are there any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| Commissioner Mullins, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Commissioner Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| No, would not want that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| My job's hard enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| It's not as hard as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| This is a bit of an unusual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| It did pass Planning Commission by a vote of 12-2 to rezone this from a planned commercial zoning to a general commercial zoning CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5024)|
| 1:23:54| Planning staff recommended against the zoning to change it from planned commercial to the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| And the reason the justification in staff's report, as I understand it, is that the planned commercial would allow them, the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| to have a development plan move forward to see what was going to be done there on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| And the applicant's point is that really on this particular piece of property, that really isn't necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5056)|
| 1:24:26| He owns the other parcels, the other two parcels to the east of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| They are already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Traditionally, before zoning was even in place, all this area was kind of a mini commercial node along Strawberry Plains and John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5075)|
| 1:24:46| This property is very small for a planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| It's 5.77 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| And the planned commercial zoning, 5.33.04,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| says that planned commercial zoning is intended for larger tracts of property with a coordinated arrangement of commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| He goes on to say it is not likely, therefore, that a planned commercial development would contain less than 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| And I was initially retained not to seek a rezoning for this property, but to help with the development plan to see what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| He wants to relocate it as an existing automotive industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| It's not really an automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| It's more like battery-operated equipment and things like that, gators and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| He wants either to expand it or at least relocate it on that corner, which would be a better place for that type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| And given there's topographical challenges, there's a floodway, the PC zone has a 50-foot peripheral boundary all the way around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5137)|
| 1:25:46| and it just really constricts what can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| And we couldn't identify a way to develop that property without having to go to the BZA for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| And even under the best conditions with environmental constraints, getting a variance is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| So we wanted to see about a rezoning first because we believe the CA zoning is more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| There's industrial property to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| There's commercial, the same CA across John Sevier, the same CA that my client already owns just to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5168)|
| 1:26:17| And given the fact there's not been any opposition kind of underlines the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| while there's sometimes a need to have a planned commercial zone to look at and mitigate impacts around the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| this piece of property really isn't appropriate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| You know, it could be developed in a way that's respectful to the existing zoning and existing uses that are surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| And this was a strikingly very similar conversation to the piece of property that Mr. Gilreath owns now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| It's immediately to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| That came through in 2018 where staff recommended planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| and this body approved the CA zoning that they were asking for back in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| So, you know, I do respect staff's consistency in their opinion on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| but I believe that the planned commercial zone is just really not appropriate for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| and the general commercial is the most appropriate zone for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| So I'd ask you follow Planning Commission's recommendation and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5236)|

| 1:27:22| I agree with Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| This is at the corner of Strawberry Plains and John Sevier Highway where there's a red light there in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5243)|

| 1:27:43| So I am going to make a motion to go as Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5263)|

| 1:29:47| This request for an amendment to the Sector Plan, the South County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| from LDR to Mixed Use Special District, South County 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| The South County Sector Plan contemplates several areas being designated for mixed land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| The rationale for this as set forth in the Sector Plan is the changing of conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| The Special Land Use Districts are located in areas that have good transportation systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| and necessary infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| This request is a minor extension of the Special District, South County Sector 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5417)|
| 1:30:27| The adjacent property to the west of our track, it includes a retail shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| as well as a golf driving range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| And on a portion of property on the north side of Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| also has the same sector designation of mixed district specialty use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| I have the hardest time saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| The South County Sector Plan recommends a diverse range of uses in the Mixed Use Special District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| from retail, office, low and or medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| The zoning recommendations that follow this Sector Plan designation under the South County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| are commercial, office, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Commercial zoning is by far the predominant zoning in this Mixed Use Specialty District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| It was noted and commented during the planning staff review at their agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| they're doing some historical research on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| that this property did not originally, under the last update or amendment to the South County Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| wasn't designated as the Mixed Use Specialty District, South County 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| likely because of site concerns with ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| There were site distance issues and therefore leading to safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| Since the South County Sector Plan was last updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| TDOT has made substantial improvements to this area of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| and these improvements have in fact alleviated the safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| There were turn lanes added, the road was expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| and the sharp curve was reduced around this property that created those site distance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5532)|
| 1:32:21| Utilities have been expanded, including new water line, new gas line in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| We're asking that you follow the Planning Commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| and approve the Sector Plan amendment to the Mixed Use Specialty District, South County 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Are there any comments from Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Seeing none, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Also, I would like to say that Simpson Road was raised about 20 feet to make it an at-grade intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5566)|
| 1:32:55| which makes it a whole lot safer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Other intersections has been widened to make it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| They're still working on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| A little faster than Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Well, a lot faster than Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I won't be alive when Alcoa Highway is finished, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| This is a good area for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| It's at Chapman City, the driving range, that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| We need to, as I told the Mayor one time, we need to stop them before they get to Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| because they're spending their money in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| That's how you get roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| That's how you get sales tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| We get it all from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| So I am going to make a motion to approve Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5617)|

| 1:34:41| as specified in the case boundary map because it is a minor extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| that is consistent with the surrounding development, subject to one condition, a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5684)|

| 1:35:19| I believe, as Commissioner Daly stated, this is a good expansion in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5719)|

| 1:35:36| Commissioners, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| I'm good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| I saw in the packet that there is a natural barrier or buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Are there going to be any other buffers in this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I think what you're referring to is there's a major gas line that runs along the eastern boundary of the entire track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| Obviously, with that gas line, there cannot be any vertical-type development over that gas line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| So you'll have that naturally man-made barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| There will also be land escape buffer requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| So with this rezoning and the condition by staff is that we would have to come back for a development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| for the commercial development on the commercial portion that will go to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| So this is for a specific portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| Will future development of this property require any additional review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| Yes, the development plan review by Planning Commission, which requires site plan, landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| all to be submitted and reviewed and ultimately approved by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Commissioner Durrett asked my question, but just to follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| and you addressed this as well as part of the condition with the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| if a landscape design plan will also be included in a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| I believe those are looked at by Planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| As far as the traffic letter, I know it will include the landscape plan, exterior lighting, architectural design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| parking signage and access, and there's some stub outs across the property in different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| and those will all be reviewed, I know, during the Planning Commission review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| whether those make sense to keep those open or not to disperse the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| Seeing no other lights, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I'd like to make a motion to approve Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Motion by Daley, second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| The next item is number 52, 1-N-24-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| It's also a request of Thunder Mountain Properties for rezoning from RA low density residential to PR plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| up to five dwelling units per acre, and the property description is the same as the two previous items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| And again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| I promise I'll sit down after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| Seeing none, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan residential zone up to five dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Would you like to speak to the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Again, rezoning request from RA to plan residential up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| This would be the rear portion adjacent to the recently rezoned commercial portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| The request is supported by recent rezonings and development plan approvals in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| There is a 117 lot townhouse development at 9109 Chapman Highway, which is southeast of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5958)|
| 1:39:27| That zoning density is at PR at 9.46 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| There is the Highlands Ridge subdivision, which is west of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| Zoning plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| The density on that is recognized as only 1.47 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| That was a 125-acre track, which was mostly hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| The development was clustered into a small corner or portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| The actual resulting density in that scenario ended up being 4.7 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| Property located on the east side of Suburban Pike rezoned to PR at 2.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| There is support of a variety of density within the recent PR rezonings ranging from above 9 to 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6017)|
| 1:40:29| Considering this being adjacent to a commercial zone track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| a 5 dwelling units per acre under the PR zone is an appropriate use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| It serves as a transition between those two tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| As stated with the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| we do have the improvements that I mentioned to Chapman Highway that Commissioner Daley also mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| That expands the lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| It's five lanes, two eastbound, two westbound with a center turn lane in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| At the intersection of Chapman and West Simpson Road was realigned and an eastbound deceleration lane was installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| The utilities have been expanded to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| The new water lines, gas lines being installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| As I mentioned previously, there's two different accesses on both sides of this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:24| Not sure if there will be access through the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| That will be something to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| But there will be a development plan review for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| There will be landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Again, along the eastern boundary, we still have the same gas line easement that no vertical improvements will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6093)|
| 1:41:42| so creating an additional barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| We'd ask that you follow up planning commission recommendation and rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| Plan residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Would the applicant be willing, and I know you addressed some of the landscape buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| but to include a condition of a landscape screen type B along the boundaries adjacent to existing residential properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6125)|
| 1:42:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| You moved on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Seeing none, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| I will let, if I agree with it, I'm going to let Commissioner Fraser approve with that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| Is that what you were going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| I will make the motion to approve per planning commission recommendation of PR up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| with one condition, a landscape screen type B along boundaries adjacent to existing residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6180)|

| 1:43:02| Motion on the floor by Fraser, second by Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Just quickly, we have very, very bright young junior commissioners with us, and when they signed up for this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6197)|
| 1:43:25| I told them I promised we would never keep them beyond 9 o'clock so that their studies and their grades could remain excellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| and we have reached that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| Now, they are not required to go home, but I did want to say thank you and not keep them any longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| so they did not get disgruntled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Junior commissioners, please feel free to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| We will continue on reading item 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| 12-D-23-RZ is a request of Freddie Treanor, Jr. for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6236)|
| 1:44:06| The property is located at 11308 and 11234 Stanley Road, parcel ID 103063 and 067 in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6246)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| The applicant introduced themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| I see one hand that has been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| We'll go ahead with discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| Actually, yes, we will go ahead with discussion first on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| Mr. Mullins, would you like to speak first, or would you like the opposition to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| I think I have to speak first under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Yes, sir, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Would you like to have it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Go ahead, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan residential zone up to five dwellings per acre because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development and is supported by local amenities, 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6314)|
| 1:45:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Ben Mullins, this is about 10.74 acres on Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| If you're familiar with Sam Lee Road, as I know Commissioners Frazier and Hill are very familiar with this stretch, it is at the 90-degree turn there at the church, which is a very challenging turn, admittedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:54| The property, however, is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| It is just to the north of the Hardin Valley Academy and the middle schools, and the sector plan designation on this property is medium-density residential, which allows for considerations of density between six and 24 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6358)|
| 1:46:17| The applicant originally asked for the lowest end of that existing medium-density residential for six units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6377)|
| 1:46:26| Planning staff recommended five dwelling units an acre because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development and is supported by local amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6386)|
| 1:46:37| The applicant accepted that recommendation, and this was voted and approved by Planning Commission by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6397)|
| 1:46:45| One of the things I think Planning Commission took into consideration in approving this unanimously is that the applicant had reached out to the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates about what they were concerned about and what type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6405)|
| 1:46:59| They wanted it to be single-family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| They wanted it to have internal sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| They wanted it to have rear entrance garages to the buildings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| Kind of a patio living front-facing and have some internal sidewalks and local amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| We have come up with two plans, one for 39 units and one for 42 units, that meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:29| We have been engaging with Hardin Valley Planning Advocates about something they feel would be compatible for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| Back to Sam Lee Road, which is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| Following the Planning Commission's vote, Engineering Public Works reached out to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| We have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| This is a great opportunity for a private-public partnership in trying to improve a very difficult stretch of Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| They recognize the medium-density residential and the type of density that would be considered for that, but they also recognize there's a chance that this needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6475)|
| 1:48:06| What they proposed is us donating 50-foot right-of-way to extend Sam Lee Road, not around that hairpin curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6486)|
| 1:48:15| but actually through the southern portion of our property and swoop up into the Boyd-Lonas property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| We don't have right-of-way acquired for the property through Boyd-Lonas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| At some point, that property is probably going to want to be developed, and there will be another opportunity to extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| Or they can acquire it through condemnation at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| But this road needs to be improved, and we're willing to do that, to extend that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| and basically leave there to be two stub-outs, driveways on Sam Lee Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| accessing those properties to the east and to the north that still need those accesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| What we passed out were three documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| One was the option that Engineering and Public Works have conceptualized that we are in agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6539)|
| 1:49:07| and the other are the two concepts that we had worked out before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| but then we took into account what the road realignment would make those concepts look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| We can make that work, either 39 or 42 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| We are still asking, though, if you do the rough math, and again, I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| math is one of the reasons I went to law school, but 10.74 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| if you have 42 units an acre, then you're in the four dwelling units an acre range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| But we don't know because we don't have a development plan fully worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| We haven't done the engineering. We haven't done all the geotechnical work that needs to be done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| We know we're giving up about an acre for the right-of-way dedication that we're being asked to do, that we're agreeing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| We'll get a little bit of that back if some of the road is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| but we don't know exactly how all that's going to shake out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| So even though we're still committed to one of those two concepts of 39 or 42 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| having it still at five units an acre will give us a little bit of flexibility to work through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| and make sure we're not putting ourselves into a corner with the project as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| This will have to go through a development plan again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| and we've agreed in addition to everything that we've talked about with the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Engineering Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| at the time we move forward with a development plan and a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| We can't get a building permit until we get a concept and development plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| So we've got a lot to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I know they asked us to contribute in some of the construction, specifically kind of the grading of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| We'll already have that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| We're working on our internal roads at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| So we'll agree to do this, and they'll talk about doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| and we'll be able to have time to really sit down and have very intentional conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| about what exactly that's going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| and have a memorandum of understanding in place at the development plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| But right now we're just asking for approval per Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| and Planning Staff's recommendation of five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| and let us kind of get in there with our hands in the dough and work through all these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| and really do something that's going to be respectful for the development that is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| the existing neighborhoods that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| and an opportunity to really make an improvement on a very bad stretch of Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| So I would ask that you support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Would opposition step forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| If you'd identify yourself and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Rob Clark, Knox County, 11228 Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| Our property, which has been in the family, is a farmland property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| Excuse me, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Sir, would you raise your right hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| Do you solemnly swear or affirm testimony you're about to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Mr. Clark, go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| So our farmland property, which has been in our family since the 1950s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| joins this property here to the south, and it's actually downhill from this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| So I've actually spoken with Mr. Farber, I think is his name, with Red Door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| He seems like a genuine fellow and seems like they're going to try to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| But here's the problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| If you're not familiar with this area, Sam Lee Road from Solway Road to Steel Road is about a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:43| and a half length of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| There is no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| There are numerous switchbacks, and just right outside this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| there are two 90-degree turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| So adding additional volume of traffic there becomes a safety concern, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| So, again, on one side of the property halfway down through there, there's actually a mountain on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| You're not going to expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| On the other side is Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| You're not going to expand that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| It's straight downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| So we're concerned about the volume of traffic that's flowing through Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| We've got Hayden Farms, Hayden Hill that's come through, plus another development that's even larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| on the west side of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| So you're adding a lot of volume in a hurry, and I keep hearing about the infrastructure concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| across the county, and it's a real concern here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| There's a song lyric that goes something like, they paved paradise and put a parking lot in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6819)|
| 1:53:47| I've lived that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| The property that Hardin Valley High School is on is our farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| It was eminent domain was taken from us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| They said, well, you got paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| We didn't want to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| It was just taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| So now we're on the north side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| We're having an issue with more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| You can't hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| There's growth concerns across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| But what I would ask you to do is consider the problem with the infrastructure for Sam Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| and limit the number of homes that are going to go in right next to our property, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| next to farmland property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Where is that water runoff going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| It's going to go straight downhill to our property into our pond where cattle graze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| So I heard someone ask about one property, whether it was farmed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| I can tell you that this property is currently being farmed and has been farmed by me and my grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6883)|
| 1:54:52| So I would ask you for consideration of the limited use of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| limited number of homes that go on that property, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| And I don't think there's anything I'm going to say that's going to keep you from approving this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| But I would also ask you to have some buffer built in between us and the neighborhood with regard to some barrier of landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| or some kind of drainage that would move that water away from the pond and the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| I want to thank Commissioner Lee and Commissioner Fraser, some of your moderated responses today and your voting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| Thank you, Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| Smellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Perhaps I missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| You're proposing realignment of the road is sort of a conditional thing, but you don't really have realignment of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| I mean, this is not on our I'm not seeing this on our capital list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| I think the Miss Commissioner Fraser indicated that she wanted to condition the rezoning upon a memorandum of understanding being entered into between us and the county about realigning the road and working through exactly what are the details of that realignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6970)|
| 1:56:28| How much are we going to be responsible for as a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| How much is the county going to be responsible for as the county in order to take away those two 90 degree turns that Mr. Clark just referenced and make it come along the south edge of our property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=6991)|
| 1:56:42| So that condition that can be imposed by commission would be we would agree to this realignment, this dedication of right of way and a memorandum of understanding as a condition of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7002)|
| 1:56:53| OK, hold there right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Do you own the Boyd Lowness property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Do you have rights to go through the Boyd Lowness property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Because this road is essentially going right through a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| It would have to stop at the edge of our property until another project could be commissioned and approved either through if it's a road project or if someone moves toward Boyd Lowness and wants to he wants to develop the property about talking about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7026)|
| 1:57:24| But at least it'll have a it'll it's one step in the process of making this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7044)|
| 1:57:31| And I believe we have spoken to Mr. Lowness and he's not in an objection to us starting this road process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7051)|
| 1:57:39| Understand at some point he would like to develop his property and that would be something that would be beneficial to him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| I got to say I got I have a I have a little heartache on this whole corner is really predicated on a new and better road that doesn't force everybody into a into the existing tight corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7067)|
| 1:58:05| I have a hard time approving it if you don't have a plan and a piece of property that I mean if you own the Boyd Lowness road and you had a plan with Mr. Snowden but unless that's there it's really hard for me to see how you guys are ever going to build a road together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7085)|
| 1:58:21| Knox County has not been in the in the business for a long long time with the exception of a time long before us that maybe eminent domain or public use was more widely used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7101)|
| 1:58:32| I I've been here six years and I don't think I've ever been part of something that we just magically said we need a new road right through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| So Mr. Snowden help me understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I think we're back to the chicken and the egg scenario but this really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| We have it and Mr. Mullen summarized it well we would like to take this opportunity to try to fix this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| Unfortunately in this condition much like years ago we had one on Nubbins Ridge that one property owner owned it all so it made it a lot more simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| In this case we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| I have shared and this alignment that my team drew up with Mr. Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7143)|
| 1:59:11| We can we could phase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Obviously I would think it's it is a project of the scale that we could easily do in house to mitigate some of that cost and obviously new projects have to come in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7154)|
| 1:59:27| But it would be one that I would recommend for consideration because as the homeowner said there I mean there's there's a lot more trips on Stanley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7167)|
| 1:59:38| It's probably 18 to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| So the way it's not too problematic but this curve is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| So I mean I would like to pursue the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| I think it's something that we could do with little with minimal cost minus the property acquisition for Mr. Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| So yeah I mean I would like to try to do the project but it would require you know I guess your all's consideration and approval of that acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7197)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Did we recently rezone a piece of property in this general area a couple of months ago or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:24| Does that ring a bell with anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| And then if we don't get the road improvements Mr. Snowden the access to their development would be where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| We could and Mr. Mullins kind of alluded to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| One of the things we could do if there was a to phase it in so to speak we could build that road along their south property line to the property to essentially their west property line and allow them to access that new road and then still leave the 90 degree curve in this current configuration until such time we can then secure the property for Mr. Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7238)|
| 2:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| How much would it cost to acquire this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| Mr. Snowden do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| Commissioner Lee we haven't looked in great detail of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| I mean let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| It's really hard to establish that right now because he would have a remainder on that I guess that northeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7290)|
| 2:01:39| We would want to make that remainder large enough that it wouldn't be a damage to that remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| We want to make sure that property up there doesn't have a diminution of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| So then we would be looking at essentially a 50 foot right of way for let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7310)|
| 2:02:00| Probably less than 1500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| So I'm not entirely sure about what the valuation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| But I do think that that expense would be justified due to the growth in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| But we don't know how much it would be at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| I mean I could make a guess ma'am but I really hate to guess at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| Well let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| Is the county in the alternative they can't purchase it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| Would they at any time consider doing an eminent domain on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| This body approves all land acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| So this body grants me that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| I would think that there is a significant public benefit by realigning that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| So the justification could be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| But it would be this body's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| I mean I could make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| I think I would make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| But it would be up to this body to give me that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| And my last question is Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| What is your plan for any type of buffer on the farm property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| Well if the road realignment is the road would run between our property and the farm property on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7396)|
| 2:03:25| So that it would be basically giving them frontage on the new Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| So we wouldn't have any if you look at the alignment there that there's really other than a small sliver that really isn't developable on that southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7411)|
| 2:03:42| The road creates that buffer area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| The road creates that buffer at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| And that's based if the county is able to acquire that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| They would acquire the right of way for our property regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| That would be the point of the memorandum of understanding and as a condition on this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7435)|
| 2:04:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| I was led to believe that Mr. Lonas was in agreement with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7452)|
| 2:04:33| Am I hearing that there's a question about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| I know that in our conversations and I wasn't personally involved in those conversations that he is supportive of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7480)|
| 2:04:49| I don't think there's any agreement with him about acquiring the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| We're starting one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| I do know he is at some point going to be interested in developing his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| And at that point that would be the time to discuss that with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| We can't do something with property we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| But we can try to make it better and give the county and empower the county the tools to improve this through this development in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7509)|
| 2:05:21| And then later there will have to be another step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| We've had a lot of discussion about this in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| We've spent time with Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| I know that HVPA has personally been in touch with the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| Kudos to your clients for their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| I know that HVPA has personally been in touch with the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| Kudos to your clients for providing this much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| This is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| It's certainly beyond what we could have asked or could have required for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| I'm very excited about the willingness of Knox County Engineering to step up and take what would be necessary to fix this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7565)|
| 2:06:20| That's very exciting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7580)|
| 2:06:30| I guess I thought this road was going to be a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| So I'm hearing now that even with an MOU between the builder and between Knox County that we cannot promise the people that this will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7594)|
| 2:06:57| because we don't have it in writing from the other property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| I think you are correct on that, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| We can only control the property that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| As a county, you have tools in your tool belt that we don't have, obviously, that Director Snowden referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7635)|
| 2:07:23| Whether that's through some type of project to acquire the rest of that or whether that's when Mr. Lowness or whomever he's selling his property to wants to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7643)|
| 2:07:34| and discussing with them finishing this road out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| But we can't do it without taking the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| This is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| Director Brooks, would you please address what could be on this property given its current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7666)|
| 2:08:04| The current zoning of the property is ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| Let me restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| The sector plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| The sector plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| Maybe additional clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| The fact that this could be medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| It is currently designated as MDR, which does allow consideration of a much greater density than what is currently being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7709)|
| 2:08:44| This is where the problem lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| I really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| I was so excited about this initially, recognizing that still what could be happening here is apartments or duplexes or something that really would not be compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7735)|
| 2:09:12| Quite frankly, I was stunned to find out that that was even a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| And that's just a result of the old plan, which certainly is not appropriate even a little bit in this area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7758)|
| 2:09:33| But this puts such a different slant on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| Can I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Might I jump in and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| ...maybe offer us an alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| Mr. Mullins, Mr. Snowden, I think that several members of this body may be agreeable to postpone this for 30 days to see if you could work out an agreement with Mr. Lonis or to find...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7787)|
| 2:10:02| I feel like if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| If this road project felt real and it was going to happen and you had a bit more concrete, then you'd be out of here in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7803)|
| 2:10:11| Right now, I hate for progress to stop because we're not quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| And I might suggest that the Commission Chair, if it's agreeable, to take 30 more days and see if we can't get something a little bit more concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| And then things can move forward without going into a period where it might be denied for a much longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7824)|
| 2:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| And also, Mr. Clark, we spoke at length, and I genuinely appreciate your concerns about runoff and pollution of your property, the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7833)|
| 2:10:51| And that's something else, too, that I'd really like to take a harder look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| I didn't realize the trajectory was as sloped as you're indicating it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7858)|
| 2:11:06| So I would be comfortable, Mr. Mullins...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| We're agreeable to a 30-day postponement to see if we can give a little bit more direction on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| It was something, again, that didn't come up until after Planning Commission's meeting that this was even an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7880)|
| 2:11:27| So as busy as everybody's been, it's been hard to get all the details nailed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| It has. I know. I know. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| Well, thank you, Commissioner Jay, for that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| And I would like to make a motion that we defer this until the April Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7897)|
| 2:11:47| March, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| It feels like April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| It does. All right. March. I apologize. March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7913)|

| 2:11:58| Thank you. We have a motion and a second on the floor. Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7923)|

| 2:13:01| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR Plan Residential Zone up to 12 dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the sector plan and the surrounding development, subject to one condition on a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=7981)|

| 2:13:20| This is one where, through the efforts of Commissioner Oster and her district, we have been able to – we haven't met directly with the neighbors, but Commissioner Oster has been a mediator and a go-between with the neighbors on this about their concerns and what we can do to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8000)|

| 2:14:13| The concerns that were raised through the neighborhood was they wanted something that was more in line with what they have, the current townhome development, and the density, 12 units an acre, they were concerned about, even though they themselves have 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8053)|
| 2:14:32| This property does have some constraints on it with the hillside, and so doing 12 units an acre on this property would be difficult anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8072)|
| 2:14:39| So we were fine with reducing our ask today that you approve a density of 10 units an acre instead of 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8079)|

| 2:15:40| We'll be dedicating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| They'll have access through our neighborhood to Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| So if and when TDOT closes that right-of-way, there will be an opportunity then to connect to our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| So we are agreeable to maintaining a right-of-way between our development – whenever we do a development plan, that will have to be on the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8152)|
| 2:16:03| That was the condition that staff imposed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| They have a stub out and an open right-of-way, so then there can be a connection if and when TDOT closes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| We won't be building the road into their neighborhood until TDOT closes that, and then that's something that they'll have to work out or ask the county to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8175)|
| 2:16:23| But we'll give them that opportunity to do that if TDOT ever does do what they've been talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| It's a state. Who knows when they get around to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| So I think that's an opportunity then to give them better access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| The neighbors, I believe, are looking forward to having different access instead of going through Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| There's a lot of existing landscaping on the property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| We're going to try to keep as much of that as we can, but to the extent we can't, we're agreeable to a Type C, which is like the lowest level landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8210)|
| 2:16:58| It's going to be a buffer between our properties and the residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| So that would just be to the west and the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| And to be clear, I talked about the 35-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| We would want to be able to reduce the setback going towards Pellissippi and Bob Gray, but that doesn't affect anybody but our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8230)|
| 2:17:17| So those are the things that we've talked about with the neighborhood, and those are the things that we are agreeable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| We'd ask that, subject to those conditions, you approve this at 10 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| Thank you. Any other comments or questions? Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| Thank you, Ben. This was pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| Ben and I have been working on two big ones. We'll have another one next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| But it's very exciting to be able to sit down with the developer and be the mediator with the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| And the constituents understand that land is sold and purchased, but we can keep them in mind, who've been taxpayers here for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8270)|
| 2:18:01| and do a development that, for my district, is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| And let me also say, when Ben and I started talking, and then when I sat down with Mr. Horvath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8286)|
| 2:18:13| he was going to do apartments, which I wasn't happy about, and neither were my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8293)|
| 2:18:20| And doing these townhomes is going to be a great opportunity for people that are needing housing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8300)|
| 2:18:30| and especially in my district. So it stays in the landscape, and I think that is huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| that we keep that identity and that landscape from neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| So I couldn't thank you, Mr. Horvath, anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| David Harbin was great to sit down, and it seems like it takes forever for us to come to an agreement sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| but when we do, it's kind of sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| So I am going to make a motion to approve 10 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8335)|
| 2:19:07| There will be landscape buffer C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| There will be a traffic study that we agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| 35 foot peripheral setback, south and west property lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8355)|
| 2:19:21| right away and stub out to Odin Street when TDOT closes the entrance to Parkway Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8361)|
| 2:19:28| which, let me say really quick, is a huge, huge deal for my people on Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| because you can imagine trying to get into that subdivision off of Pellissippi at 90 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8373)|
| 2:19:42| So this is great, and they're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| And the new developments entrance will be to Bob Gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| so they won't be coming through Parkway Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| We have a motion on the floor that I won't repeat, but I trust you've gotten down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| By Oster, seconded by Schoonmaker. Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8409)|

| 2:20:54| My understanding, this is the second no-show of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| Commissioner Oster, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| No, I've actually tried to reach out a couple of times and haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| This was deferred from January, so with it being a no-show, my motion will be to deny the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8469)|

| 2:21:54| All right, this will automatically be deferred and Commissioner Beeler, you'll reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8514)|
| 2:22:01| I believe we have no zoning appeals. We have no amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8521)|

| 2:22:16| Thank you, Madam Chair. Now, to do with zoning, but I messed up and did not tell our junior commissioners before they were dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8536)|
| 2:22:26| I will follow up with them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| Last week, in preparation of their mock meeting next week, the junior commissioners voted on who would be the chair and vice chair of their own mock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8548)|
| 2:22:40| I'm happy to say your new junior commissioner chair is William Mendoza-Uceda and your new vice chair is Baylis Bolt, both of which are representing 3rd and 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8560)|
| 2:22:52| So I will let you reach out, but I apologize for not mentioning that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| Oh, and I also passed on incorrect information too, because I believe I was thinking we were patterned after last year, which the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8577)|
| 2:23:13| That was a bit of the feedback. They wanted to choose their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| All right, so I owe him apology. I've been trying to gear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| At any rate, we are about to adjourn zoning, and before we do, you always have to listen to something from me before we reconvene, and now is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226-zoning?start=8601)|
