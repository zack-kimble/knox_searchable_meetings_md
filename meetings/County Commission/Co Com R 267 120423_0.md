| 0:01:32| Clerk, would you read in the record 5A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Easy Stop Food Mart, number 67551 Oak Ridge Highway, Easy Stop Food Marts, Inc., Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=95)|
| 0:01:44| I'm sorry, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Sir, would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Tommy Hunt, CEO, part owner of Easy Stop Food Marts, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| and we have our supervisor, store manager, and trainer here as well, if you'd like any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| We're not contesting the arrest and citation of our employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| He did make the sale, despite two attempts to key in the date, which he keyed in correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| and the registrar told him not to make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| He went ahead and made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| We instruct our employees, Ms. Kirkpatrick instructs our employees prior to them taking duty in the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| on customer service, beer and alcohol, responsible selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| and a training session lasts a day in our corporate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| They sign a copy of our beer and alcohol policy as part of their application, which I have brought here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| if you all would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| We also do a monthly review with each and every employee at each and every store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| which I have a copy of this store for the four months that this young man was in our employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| We also employ an outside agency to do mystery shops in our stores monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| If the employees fail our mystery shops, they go through retraining one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| If they fail a second time, then they are terminated by us on our shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| We have 22 stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| This is the first citation we have had since we had, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| a lady who was on chemotherapy and working three days until she retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| and got caught for a mystery shop in Knoxville last spring as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| Other than that, it had been several years before we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We operate 22 stores in East Tennessee, take our responsibilities seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| I have college-age girls and know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| And so that's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| We made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| We've got to fess up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Tucker Spankin, if you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Officer Mays, would you please just state for the record exactly the time, date, and offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| On March 8, 2012, I sent an underage into the Easy Stop 7551 Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| about a six-pack of Coors Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| We already have an admission of the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Yes, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| So you take pretty good measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| You've got an in-house training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Secret Mystery Shopper and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| You know, we've been pretty strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| But, I mean, you've taken some pretty significant measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| But I think we have a standard that we've kind of laid out on first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| And I'm going to go ahead and make that motion for a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| or, at your choosing, a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| And I can agree that you definitely have taken a lot of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| And I do appreciate your candor and honesty in admitting what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| I'm just generally curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| So it sounds like, you know, I'm trying to get inside the head of the cashier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| It sounds like the person wasn't intentionally trying to sell this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Was it just a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| I had already sent an email out that day saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| trust the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| If it tells you no, I'm not going to fuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Don't make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| And we do that routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Because, you know, if you're standing at the counter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| and the guy is six foot three and he bought a beer up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| you don't want to make him mad if you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| But thank goodness we got the ability to say the state made us ask for your ID now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| so we don't have that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| We're very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| But the young man did not trust the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| It told him, do not make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| And he thought anybody, in his thinking and the words afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| that anybody that presented an ID had to be legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| or they wouldn't have brought it up in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| What's the status of this employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| He is a former employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| My fellow commissioners, this is off on the side and not related to this one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| But I think it again points out to us the fact that no matter what the employer does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| there's not a stigma attached to or a punishment attached to the person that actually broke the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| Motion on the floor is 30-day suspension or a $500 fine at the whatever the applicant would choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=404)|

| 0:07:18| I'm a customer service manager at this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| My store manager, Steve Albright, is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| If you have any questions, you'd like to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| And we do not contest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| What kind of mechanisms do you have in place, sir, to preclude this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| What we have in place, we use Diane Pearson, who teaches top shelf at our location, to come in and certify our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=454)|
| 0:07:45| We also have the register safeguards similar to what Easy Stop has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| And within our own corporate policies, I'll actually read part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| we actually have a waiver that we have all our associates sign, whether they are old enough to sell in the state of Tennessee or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| that says the only acceptable identification is government-issued ID with photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Be sure month and day as well as year of birth is checked on the identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| and properly keyed into the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Looking back on our records, the associate, I should say former associate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| was not keying in the month and day as presented on the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I have no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Make the same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| I mean, other than the fact that you guys have taken great measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| I think it's kind of a baseline for us is a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension at your choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| You said he just keyed in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Was it to a friend or he did it on purpose or by accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| From what we could tell on the journal receipt, it was almost like our training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=537)|
| 0:09:08| our insistence on keying in the proper month and date was lost on this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| And I was not there that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| I didn't get to look at the recruit's ID or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| but I can almost with absolute certainty say that it was nowhere near the actual date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| Well, both of these cases today, I think, kind of point out that as much care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and precautions and training as you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| it's only as good as the person on that end standing behind the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| And I know you all take great care in, first off, hiring these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| and running them this way, but it is unfortunate that you have to bear the penalty in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| And I'm like Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I just wish there was some way that we could do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| But, anyway, keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| And that is my question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| I thought that there's a citation process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| So what does the citation cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| What's the citation cost to the individual who's the offender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| I mean, does he have to go to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Does he have court costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Does he have to pay a penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| The individual would pay a fine plus court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Usually they put them on probation for $1,129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| A lot of them are eligible for diversion, which, if they don't get in any other trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| it comes off the record after $1,129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| So, Wolfie, in this type of situation, say an average penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| and court costs would cost the individual what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Give me a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Probably close to $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| And I think, Wolfie, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| they can't sell for, as long as it's on their record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| they can't sell for two or three years anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| They can't be employed where they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| I think they've changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I'd have to defer to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| But I think that they've changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| It used to be that way where, for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| that they couldn't work in a place that served alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| even if they were in a restaurant and they were a dishwasher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| But I think that's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| And I would like to say about Ingalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| that my underage person actually handed the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| and basically just looked and handed it right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| And that would be something, both for the gentleman from Easy Mart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| and this gentleman from Ingalls, if it was me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| I would certainly be emphasizing the punitive possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| not just keying in and, you know, the technical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| To me, if I was a $500 hit, that's a whack for a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| probably in the category that you employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| So that stress and emphasis on that I think might serve you in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So the motion on the floor is a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| at the applicants or the licensee choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Deferred discussion and possible action against beer permittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| that are delinquent in paying their annual beer privilege tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| and or Knox County business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Renee Lynn Thompson, Pat's Corn Pound, 7715 Clinton Highway, on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=770)|
| 0:12:59| Is Renee Lynn Thompson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| Officer Mays, can you give us any updates since the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| The Corn Pound is still closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Coach did a fine job of getting all the things that was flea market stuff in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| And I think they've moved from that building, one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| down to a tire store that has tires piled up in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| Do they have a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| But the business is closed and has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Previous last month she was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| and she said that she was holding on to the beer license because if she sold it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| she wanted to give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| And I tried to explain to her that they would have to make an application through you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| as far as the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| My understanding, too, that their privilege tax still yet remains unpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| which is grounds for suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| I'd like to make a motion we suspend the beer license pending them coming to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and to paying their privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Commissioner, motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Our next item, I believe, has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Do we need to vote on it being withdrawn or is it just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| So item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Jeffrey James Barron's J.B.'s Creekside Tavern, 7428 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| This should be on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| It's formerly Beer 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Jeffrey Barron's, 2309 Denton Way, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Sir, you have been sworn, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I'm going to ask you a series of questions, please, and I ask that you answer audibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| I haven't, but I haven't taken over because of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| You can't go into the location until after you get all this process done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| so I don't know what any of the employees in the building haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| And beer has been sold at this location before, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Is there a pending license at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Okay, so there's an outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Is this for on and off premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| And what is your relation to the owner of the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| He's a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=943)|

| 0:21:49| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Sir, please state your name and business address for the record, and please, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| explain to the Commission your purpose here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| My name is Jack W. Piper, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| I'm an attorney here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| My office is located at 550 West Main Street, Suite 310, in the Bank of America building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| just west of the City-County building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| I'm here representing Lorena Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Ms. Rice previously operated as the owner of the Game Room, which was a bar located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| on Sutherland Avenue just west of West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| The armory in that area actually, I guess, immediately west of what used to be the golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| and student housing that was the UT complex that's been razed recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| There was an investigation that actually began several years ago with some undercover Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| Police Department detectives or some informants that went in and found that there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| sales of illegal drugs occurring there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| She had a couple of appears or allegations made, at least, that she had a couple of bartenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| She says she was unaware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| As a result of that investigation, those bartenders have been charged, and there has been a count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| against my client that she was aware of it and conspired with them to make those sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| She disputes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Basically, there's an agreement that's been made between me on behalf of my client and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| the DA's office that if she agrees that she will not ask for another license to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| an establishment of that type, then that will resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| She is 74 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Frankly, she was an absentee operator in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Her husband's been suffering from cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| She was not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| The DA's office is prepared to work something out with us as long as this board would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| And also the city of your board is also doing the same sort of thing that would prohibit her from requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| or being authorized to operate an establishment that serves alcohol in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| We're asking that you approve this agreed order so it's a part of your minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| That will satisfy the DA's office as far as her inability to do such in the future in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| Commissioners, I have reviewed the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| It is legally sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| You're empowered to enter into it, and I see no legal reason why you should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| That's all of the business that we have before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| We are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1462)|
| 0:24:41| It is 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1481)|

| 0:25:30| Just don't nobody call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| With regards to our resolutions, we have two resolutions that we would like to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| one honoring Coach Pat Summitt, the other one honoring Coach Warlick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| They will not be here today, but we'll ask you to approve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| There will be an opportunity for us to present those to them at a function later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| So do we have a motion that they be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=1549)|

| 0:35:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| I just want to thank the commission for approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| and I was glad to bring this forward any way that we can honor our veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| a lot of which paid the ultimate sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| I think we need to, and Mr. Bacon was a true hero to this community as well as to this nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| so I think the mayor wants to speak and then we'll let Ms. Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ms. Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| General Bacon is a fraternity brother of mine, and he's just a really good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Too often in this society what somebody seems to do with a football is who our heroes are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| and here's a man who fought for his country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| And if you ever knew General Bacon, he was one of the kindest people I'd ever been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| I can't imagine how he'd be as a fighter pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I guess he saved all his meanness in the air because he was always a complete gentleman around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and he was especially kind to my daddy who was just an old Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| So I know that was hard on him to be that way, but it seemed to work out very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and Bud was just a class act all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| And every time there was a veterans, anything to do with veterans, Memorial Day, Veterans Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| or any parade or anything about something at one of the cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| Bud was always kind enough to loan his time to be there and just a class act, and he is greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you, Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I would like to thank all of you, too, for this wonderful honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| especially since it's a library because he was such an avid reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2220)|
| 0:37:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| If I could have just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| You know, this points out that a lot of times we fail to honor those sometimes until they're gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| but in this case it's great to honor his memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| This past Wednesday I had the occasion to go with about 129 veterans to Washington on the Honor Air flight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2250)|
| 0:37:41| If you want a real experience, you need to go as a guardian on that flight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| and see these ladies and gentlemen that gave their lives, in some cases not these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| but a lot of their friends gave their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and these folks gave their time and talents to be sure that we were able to meet like we do here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| So I just want to say thanks to Colonel Souter and the Honor Air team for a great day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| and I would encourage anybody to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2293)|

| 0:38:56| We have over 15 people who have signed up to address us at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| We only have one item that is not on consent that we are to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| and so we want to go ahead and get our regular business done, should move very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| and then we're going to go into the public forum segment of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2349)|

| 0:39:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| As we begin is that this is TCAPS week in Knox County, so this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| please pray for our students and their educators that they do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| Give them support this week as they embark on their TCAPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| There will be prayer in school this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| There will be, and at home, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| There are over a dozen unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and separate religions that are practiced in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and hundreds of denominations and sects within those religions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| And during devotion time, it can be difficult to represent everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| But whenever it's my turn to do devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I like to try to incorporate the devotional practices of religions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| that we don't normally see in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| And today I wanted to talk a little bit about the Religious Society of Friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| who are known as the Quakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And some of the most wonderful and spiritual services I've ever attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| have been during a friends meeting, which if you've never attended one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| it's conducted mostly in silence without an ordained minister leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| And so what we're going to do today is I'd ask everyone to please take a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| for prayer, contemplation, meditation, focus on the work that we have ahead of us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| and become centered and ready to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2479)|
| 0:41:49| Silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2509)|
| 0:42:20| Eternal source, please grant us wisdom and compassion and grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| as we undertake this work before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Blessed be, shalom and amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Our pledge of the flag will be led by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Let's all stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2573)|
| 0:43:02| Next item is the approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| The Knox County Law Director is entering into a determination about the new District 89 seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2595)|
| 0:43:26| and I'd like to add an item of discussion for the Law Director to sort of tell us where that may stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2606)|
| 0:43:35| as it relates to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| We'll put that on item for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| And then a second thing, this week on Wednesday the Charter Review Commission meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| Could we have at the tail end of this today, if we are still discussing things, some charter review issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2626)|
| 0:43:57| And I'm not wanting to really vet anything or talk about anything that might be before the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| but Commissioner Broyles has a discussion item that we could have discussed earlier, except we did not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| Well, she withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| And whether Commissioner Shoust is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| maybe Commissioner Broyles and I might like to know the feel of commissioners about the size of commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2659)|
| 0:44:30| as a result of today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| If we could add that as a short discussion item also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| It will be added during discussion time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Given that we have a lot of the people here that are in favor of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=2679)|

| 0:57:21| and I wanted to recognize them and tell them how much we appreciate them taking an interest in Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3441)|
| 0:57:31| and learning not only the great thing about the Citizens Academy was it wasn't just about how government worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| It was teaching individuals how to better interact with government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| how to become more involved in the process, and how to take charge of their local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| And it was a wonderful experience for me to watch this take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| So I want to recognize the first class, which is Rachel Bodenbender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3475)|

| 0:58:50| How could I have forgotten Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Paul, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And I would like for my vice president, Wren Doops, to speak on behalf of the league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| She was chair of the Citizen Academy Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| Just to let you guys know, our academy was three sessions, one on how county government works, one on advocacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| and one was a simulation held right in this very room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| And if any of your chairs are higher or lower than they usually are, it's because some of our participants were sitting in your chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| So I just wanted to thank Commissioner Hammond, County Law Director Joe Jarrett, Dean Rice, Stephanie Matheny, Chris Irwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| Margo Klein, Carleen Malone, Mark Harmon, Hubert Smith, Suzanne Doops, Laura Cole, Blunt Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3572)|

| 0:59:45| who was at every session with us and helped us in many different capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3585)|

| 0:59:51| This is something that meant a lot to me and Jamie and Randy also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| and we were just very happy that we got to do it and very proud of our participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| And we will be doing this again next year, and we hope to work with you guys again and maybe even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| and with the mayor's office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3606)|

| 1:00:23| Chuck Williams, 922 Oglewood Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| One of the things they taught us in this room is you give your name and address and they seem to forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Basically, every citizen should be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| I really think not only with the county, I know they're talking about doing it for the city level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| but I like to see them do it on the court level, the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| and even as far as the agencies within the city and the county so people will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| I mean, I know because I've been involved, so have people like Sharon Welch, Paul Bernie, but others that don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| And I'm thrilled that the commission backed this and that the League of Women Voters did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| Mr. Paul Bernie's got something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you, Chuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3672)|

| 1:01:20| and that is a friend of mine, a retired fellow Oak Ridge National Lab employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| is really active in the Oak Ridge chapter of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| And when I first laid this program out to her about what the Knoxville chapter was, I guess your chapters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| or what was planning, you know, this was a ‑‑ she was just amazed that the league had the wherewithal to organize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| and to team with a county entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| So kudos to you all for really being trendsetters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| The next person who signed up to speak is Ricky Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3713)|

| 1:02:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3722)|

| 1:02:15| Would you give us your name and address of the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3735)|

| 1:02:20| My address is 6810 Truesdale Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| I'd like to thank Ms. Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Last Tuesday night I came for the city council meeting, just attended, whatever, and showed up my signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| And I was actually grabbed behind, twisting my arm, pulled outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| and told I could not bring my sign inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| And my signs, I'm out to the public, express concerns about the incompetent judges we have in the state offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3768)|
| 1:02:58| And, like I say, I want to play a tape of some evidence that shows the corruption of the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| Pardon me, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Mr. Jarrett, would you rule on the appropriateness of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| If you'll hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Playing audio tapes and making these types of accusations, I'm not sure that that's what we're going to be able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| but I want to get our law directors ruling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Obviously, free speech is one thing, but we may be crossing the line just a bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Mr. Jarrett, would you explain to Mr. Jarrett what you're asking to do, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| I've got some evidence that shows judges are corrupt and not doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| and they're trying to take my paring time away from me because I've exposed actions of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| And, like I say, I'm just trying to use public forum to let the public know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| You have two other recourses, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| You can talk to the state attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| and the Tennessee Supreme Court just changed the rules relative to complaints against judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| You may want to call Nashville, call the administrative office of the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| They're on the Web, and there is a new complaint process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| If you feel you have a viable claim against a sitting judge, they will investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| So, sir, you have other recourse, but I'm not going to allow you to play the tape here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I'm just not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| And you can check with Mr. Jarrett here to get the addresses and the phone numbers of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| if you would like to pursue your complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Next, we have a number of people who have signed up to talk about the school budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| and so we'll move right into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| First of all, Mr. Mike West, Mr. West, if you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| if you'd give us your address for the record, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Mike West, 2055 Hidden Cove Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| I am a managing partner and CEO of BPV Capital Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| and I spend almost all of my day thinking about and investing in macroeconomic issues that affect people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| that affect the people that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| And I can tell you that the biggest driver of economic success is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| Nothing even comes close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Now, the funny thing is we probably all agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| Almost everyone would say that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| and almost everyone would stand up and proudly proclaim their support of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| But you're faced with a difficult task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| and that is do you approve a budget that would require a tax increase to citizens in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| The funny thing about taxes, I don't like taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I don't like paying them, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| I suspect if I gave everybody in this room $1,000 for showing up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| somebody would be mad that they have to pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| That's just the world we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| The world we also live in is the world where we're competing with everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| People are making sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| People are doing things necessary to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| I'm not sure we are, but other parts of the country are, and certainly the rest of the world is competing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| So here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Leadership's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| You're privileged and blessed and honored to represent us, and we appreciate your effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| Sometimes leadership requires you to do things that aren't popular, like doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| Sometimes it requires you to even do things that your DNA tells you you don't want to do, which is to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| Now, I'm not going to stand here and argue over things like how much the administrative budget is and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| What I will tell you is that at the end of the day, I've never seen a company have success through cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| You don't create a great company by cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| I can't get to profitability by cutting my way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| I have to grow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| You have to innovate, and to innovate you have to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| So I know this is a really tough decision that you face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| There's a lot of pressure in this town to cut expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| That's really not thinking towards the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| And so if you want to look at what we look like in the future, think about what we invest in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| If you don't invest in today, it won't be pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| I promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Now, I plan on spending the rest of my life here, and I believe in education, and I know you do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| I know you believe in education, but you have to believe in investing in education to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Next is Vinnie Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Vinnie Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| If they come in, we'll be happy to hear from them before we finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Sandra Clark and Jake Mabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| Could you give us your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| My name is Jake Mabe, 6503 Arborcrest Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| It is an honor and a privilege for us to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| You know, none of us likes taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| None of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| You know, particularly if you're a born and bred, lifelong East Tennessee Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| Heck, I've still got my Kaz Walker for president T-shirt hanging in the closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| And unless your name is Mike Wallace, you know, you're not reporters taught not to insert oneself in the middle of a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| We believe so strongly in the budget that Dr. Jim McIntyre has presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| that we came here today to look you in the eye and speak to you directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| You know, we got to thinking that of our new staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| we probably spend more time in the school system other than students, school system employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| or those that get a check from the school system, or from PTA volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| And so we've seen the needs of the teachers, and we've seen the success of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| and we've imagined what could be and what can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| You know, a few weeks ago, Sandra Clark, in her usual timid fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| had a line in her column something about leaders leading and chickens hiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| Well, I don't think there are any chickens here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| but we have a memento for you that Sandra just gave you to remember this promise will make you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| If you choose to support it, we'll support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| We've got your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| We've got you covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Those feathers are our promise to you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| And, oh, by the way, just in case you all want to know where those feathers came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| I'd like to quote the great poet laureate of the 1970s, Mr. John Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| It was nine feet high and six feet wide and soft as a downy chick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| It was made from the feathers of four yellow geese, took a whole boat of cloth foot thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| We rolled eight kids and four hound dogs and a chicken we stole from a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| We didn't get much sleep, but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Don't give up your day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Our next person is Kelly Shiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| And if you'd give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Hello, 8406 Thornberry Court, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| Hello, commissioners, and thank you for letting me be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| I'm a parent of a fifth grade student at Rocky Hill Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| My fifth grader will be going on to Bearden Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| and then I have a kindergartner restarting again at Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| I've also had the privilege of serving as the PTO president at Rocky Hill this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| I've really gotten to know the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| gotten to know a lot about our teachers and the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| and just have a high respect for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| I'm here today to just express my support of the school budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| and urge your consideration to support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| There are lots of reasons that I do support the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| but I just want to share one brief story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I was on a run a couple of weeks ago with a friend of mine who's a realtor in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| and she was sharing with me about one of her clients who was moving to Knoxville from Germany.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| And she was saying that the only school that they would consider sending their high schooler to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| was West High, and it was really because of the introduction of the International Baccalaureate Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| And she was saying, you know, really, West has become such an in-demand school to be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| And I said, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| In fact, I know 10 middle school students who are moving to West High from a private school for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| So anyway, it occurred to me that really Knox County has the same opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| to really be the place to send your children for public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| You know, we can be the community where people move not just for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| and for great community life, but also because we have the best schools in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| You know, I think Dr. McIntyre set out a very, very challenging five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| But there's no way we're going to be able to reach the goals that he set before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| unless we allocate proper resources to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| And so I think we have a great opportunity to move our schools from good schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| We've loved Rocky Hill. We love public schools here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| But we have the opportunity to move from good to really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| And so I urge you, again, to show your support and to allocate community resources to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Mary Kay Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And Ms. Sullivan, if you would give us your address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Good day. Mary Kay Sullivan, 1039 Scenic Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| I'm here today in support, in strong support, of the budget approved by the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| and also in support of the goal that they, and I believe you, articulated, let me see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| for Knox County to be the best school district in the southeastern U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| I'm excited by that goal, and I applaud you for articulating such an ambitious and achievable goal, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| Now I want to ask your help in the next step in reaching this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| And this is the funding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Several other speakers have addressed this, so I'll cut my remarks in half here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| But I do want to suggest that to make this goal a reality, we do need to consider, you, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| will consider raising the property tax rate a modest bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I and other citizens are willing to sacrifice a little bit to achieve excellence in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| I'm a teacher of finance, and I often bring to my students examples of things that have increased in price over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| Milk, bread, I won't go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| But I will mention one to you that I dug up for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| To show you that since, well, property tax rates have not increased since 1999-2000, but a number of other things have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4500)|
| 1:15:10| The example I want to give to you is movie ticket prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| And I calculated in those 12 years, movie ticket prices have increased a cumulative 56%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4514)|
| 1:15:23| So I just throw that out for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I do think it is appropriate to ask Knox County citizens to sacrifice a little bit to achieve excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| We've heard some of the benefits, well-prepared students that companies are really looking for to hire as employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4534)|
| 1:15:42| increased property values, a number of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| I would like to ask you to consider this funding as an investment, an investment in the future of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| an investment in the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| And I'm convinced that we will all benefit from your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| Thank you for all you do on County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| Just so that everyone knows the procedure that we're going to be going through on the budget, we have not received the budget yet from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| The mayor will present that to us at 9 o'clock here in this auditorium on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| After that, there will be a series of public forums in each of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| May the 16th, we are scheduled to have budget meetings here that will not involve the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| We do have a joint meeting with the schools on May the 22nd, where we will be talking and discussing the budget with them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4594)|
| 1:16:43| And then we're looking at having our regular commission meeting on May the 29th, the day after Memorial Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| which will not include the budget, but a special call meeting on Tuesday, which will be May the 30th at 5 p.m. here in the main auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4609)|
| 1:16:57| At that time, we will be considering the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| So just for your calendars and just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Alex Lavage has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| And if you would give us your address and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Alex Lavage, my permanent address is 6545 South North Shore Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| I'm here today as one of many volunteers of the Support Our Schools Grassroots Movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| as well as a third-generation Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| From what I can tell after dozens of conversations with my friends and neighbors across both District 4 and the rest of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| the overwhelming majority of them, representing all sides of the political spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| are supporting this forward-thinking budget increase for the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| Those that are young parents or parents-to-be agree that it is not in their self-interest to have Knox County schools spend only $7,543 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4662)|
| 1:17:54| Our ranking is practically last in a per-student funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| which in part explains why we also rank poorly in metrics like ACT performance when compared to surrounding districts like Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| which spends close to $11,000 per student, Merrillville, Shelby County, and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| The only way to turn the tide is to provide more instructional time and to provide more intervention for struggling students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| two components of this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Needless to say, these are two salient areas of education where we cannot cut the budget on the path to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| Other colleagues, whom are entrepreneurs, business owners, or young professionals under the age of 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| whom are all fiscally conservative, told me that they are keenly aware of the fact that even if they were to send their child to a private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| or think about sending their child to a private school, that as future community stewards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| a slight property tax increase is a strategic investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| Numerous case studies and surveys suggest that it can mean over the long run more employers will consider moving to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| Our businesses will have an educated and competitive workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| and that an increase in property values in the long run could offset the short-term costs of increasing taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Thank you for your time and for all the hard work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| James Norris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4757)|
| 1:19:32| And, Mr. Norris, if you give us your address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| Yes, James Norris, 2804 Knott Road, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| First and foremost, I want to say I'm here as a taxpayer of the Third District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And today I have been asked to come on behalf of the Knoxville chapter of the Tennessee Society of Professional Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| As a local chapter, we have over 200 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| Our disciplines include all engineers, civil, mechanical, electrical, nuclear, just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| We are part of a national society of over 45,000 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| The Tennessee Society of Professional Engineers really focuses on all engineering professions and all aspects of those professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| But one thing we really pride ourselves on, especially on the local level, is our STEM involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| so anything involving science, technology, engineering, and math education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| With the presence of the University of Tennessee Department of Engineering, or, excuse me, Department of Energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| and the Tennessee Valley Authority in this area, as well as other STEM entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| there's a large concentration of STEM professionals in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| We feel like we represent their interests very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And as on behalf of TSP here today, we have shown up to let the commission know that our board has decided to endorse the proposed budget increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4846)|
| 1:20:58| and has also decided to request that our members contact their individual representatives and county commissioners to voice their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| We hope to be a leader and set an example for the other STEM societies in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| to advocate and assist in the attainment of this objective of the Knox County School Strategic Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| which is the excellence in all children, K-12 STEM education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| We're also looking to engage the Americans Association for the Advancement of Science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| which is the world's largest science society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| This would not be the first time that our local chapter has become a leader in the education realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Our Knoxville chapter was the founder of the Vols for STEM program, if you're familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| This program facilitates the collaboration of area STEM professionals, educators, and employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| to improve K-12 STEM education and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Primarily, this is accomplished by getting STEM professionals involved as volunteers to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| and be in STEM-related outreach activities to area youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| We are also looking to provide resources and possible funding to STEM-related programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| Some of the programs you may have heard of, the Math Counts program, the FIRST Robotics Competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| these are all things that we look forward to helping with in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| We've all read reports that over the last several years, STEM education in America has fallen behind our peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| as the gentleman said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| The Knoxville chapter of TSP is willing to roll up our sleeves and work to reverse this trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| with our programs and sponsorship, but we also need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| We would ask that the commission approve the proposed budget for the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| As a personal note at the end, I want to appreciate each and every one of you for your service to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| and thank you for giving me the time to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=4968)|

| 1:23:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| My name is Virginia Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I live at 5332 River Brier Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| I want to first off thank all of you for the service you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| I know it's very time-consuming and you have big decisions to make as far as the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| I want you to know that I live in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| I'm very involved in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I've been very involved in my kids' elementary school, and now I serve as the PTA president for Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| I also serve as the president of the Homeowners Association that I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| And I really feel like I'm out in the community talking to people on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| I personally am behind this proposal by Knox County School Board, and I really hope that you will be behind it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| I fully support a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| And as I'm out in the community, I'm talking about this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| I mean, I never thought I'd talk about something as much as I'm talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| And what I'm finding is that people, I'm not finding people not supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| People don't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| And when I start talking about it, the thing that I keep hearing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| well, of course our elected officials are behind this, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| And I'm like, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| You've got to let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| So I really think there's a lot of just unknown out in our community that we're trying to get out there and let people know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| Because I'm really finding as people learn more about this, they're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| They're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Our schools have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| And one other thing I'd really like to say is I think we hear so much about the problems in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| and where we need to get going and how this budget can help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| but we forget about all the great things going on in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| I had the opportunity on Friday to sit on a scholarship committee at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Fourteen kids competed, and these kids are amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| I mean, I wish I'd been that together when I was a senior in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I talked to my friends who've got kids at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| These kids are going on to amazing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Austin East just won the ethics competition for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| and their head leader for that team is going to an Ivy League college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| Across our county, kids are doing amazing things in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| But there are a lot of kids that need a lot more help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| and this budget is there to help them to bring the ones up that they can succeed the best they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| and contribute back to our society so they're not contributing to crime and the social welfare system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| Anyway, I'll conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| I want to thank you all for your time and consideration over the next month or so that you're considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| David Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| Sir, if you would give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| David Patterson, 5400 Montrose, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| I've been a resident of Fountain City for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| During my career here in Knoxville, I have been heavily involved in a lot of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| but the most important one was economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I was director of the Tennessee Technology Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| I appeared before the county commission a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Johnny Mills back there could probably recount some of the rather tough fights we had to preserve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| And when I was involved in recruiting, when someone asked about the educational system here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| I talked about Oak Ridge and Maribor and, you know, about our great private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| That was we don't want to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Other people have talked about the importance here of good schools for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| So I won't go there, but just let me add a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| Firms today require higher education for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| If you can't read well, if you can't do math, at least algebra, when you graduate from high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| you're not going to be able to go very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| You won't even be able to get through Pellissippi State or Rhone State without some remedial courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| An educated workforce can be thought of as a critical part of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| If a group of people were here raising what my beloved Aunt Mary used to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| about bridges falling down or potholes, you would respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| The lack of a well-educated labor force is at least as important, if not far more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| If you look at the numbers on the percentage of our grade school children that can read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5256)|
| 1:27:45| the eighth grade students that can do math, et cetera, those are potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| Those are falling down bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| And we'd better fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Finally, frequently people say, well, you can't throw money at the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| I would like, when you say that, to think about all of those people in our community that spend a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| their own money, sending their children to expensive private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| They are throwing money at the problem with a great deal of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| I hope you can continue your good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Did I miss anyone that had signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| I want to make a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| If you would come on down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| If you would give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| And you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I'm Greer Novinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| I live at 931 Highland Point Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| I'm a grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| I'm retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| I live on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| I have two brilliant grandchildren at Beaumont School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| I've spent a lot of time at Beaumont, and I've spent a lot of time volunteering at Lonsdale School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| All of these kids need to be presented with a challenging, creative curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| And it takes money, and it takes time, and it takes training to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| Our kids need to be challenged to take risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| And I can say everything that everybody else has said, but I encourage you to make the tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| I think many, many, many of my friends are willing to go for higher property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| if it's going to mean what a better educated workforce, better educated population will mean to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5371)|
| 1:29:40| It's an investment in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Thank you, and I encourage you to make the difficult choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Yes, the lady on the --if you would give us your name and address of the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you so much for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| My name is Elsa Nouns, and I live at 928 Woodside Street, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5399)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you so much for allowing me to come here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| I was bragging to my daughter on the way over here that this is one of the great things about this nation and this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| I am here, like everyone else, to ask the county commissioners and Mayor Burchett to fully fund the school board proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5419)|
| 1:30:34| I am the president of the PTA at Sequoia Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| and we had a resolution that we support this budget proposal, and, in fact, we had a vote on it, and it was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5439)|
| 1:30:52| Every single person in the room supported this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| and I made them understand that it means that property taxes will go up, and everyone still was okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5456)|
| 1:31:07| I hear a theme here today that we are willing to pay higher property taxes to get this budget proposal fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5467)|
| 1:31:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Give us your name and address of the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| My name is John Bostead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| I live at 7317 Westridge Drive, 37909, right down the road from West Hills Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5491)|
| 1:31:40| I've owned a home in Knoxville for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| My kids graduated, went through Bearden Elementary and Bearden Middle School, and graduated from Bearden High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| I've noticed in living here 30 years that Knoxville citizens generally follow their elected leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| They expect them to do the right thing for the community while they get on with their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| Now, this year's school budget presents all of us with a leadership moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| It reminds me of that old American poem, the road less traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Go back to high school English, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| You remember how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5539)|
| 1:32:29| The old familiar road is no new taxes, but if we take that road, we're just going to fall farther behind Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5549)|
| 1:32:38| and Merrillville and Chattanooga and all our other competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| To take the road less traveled, on the other hand, to take leadership, is to seize this rare moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| when everything is coming together, the plan, the leadership, the resources are there, and the community support is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5572)|
| 1:33:04| Where a modest property tax increase that we're all willing to pay would mean much better schools, much better student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5584)|
| 1:33:13| This is not throwing money at problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| You know from reading the plan there are nine specific targets, and accountability is built in from the first to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5596)|
| 1:33:25| We know great schools help attract new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| The chamber tells us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| But great schools also raise home values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| People pay more for homes near great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| In fact, should we dream a little bit, that rise in property values could repay this property tax increase in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5619)|
| 1:33:51| So in closing, leadership often means taking the road less traveled, but it could pay off and in more than dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5631)|
| 1:34:02| To take Knox schools from good to great would be to look to the future rather than the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| It would leave a big legacy from your time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| Like that of Lamar Alexander, remembered for being the education governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Looking back ten years from now, your leadership could be the time when Knox County began to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5666)|
| 1:34:35| We all know the community with the best schools wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| I hope you'll lead us to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you for letting me talk with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Is there anyone else that wanted to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| If not, let's have the discussion item from Commissioner Norman about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| And Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Thanks to all the folks that came today and wanted to support the schools and support the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| There's nothing that has been said that I disagree with at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| Scott Peck was one of my favorite authors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| And in being a teacher, a foreign teacher, as all these guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| the easiest thing for me to do in the world would be just to fall in line with the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| as have been made from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| But I have this deep question that I can't ignore, and I must keep probing at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| at least until I have some satisfaction that it's been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| And so the question is, as my colleagues know, it does revolve around central management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5748)|
| 1:35:56| And my intent in the budget process for the people who don't, haven't heard me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| or haven't been to meetings in which I've expressed this, it is just to address the question about size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5761)|
| 1:36:10| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I don't, you know, fundamentally, there's a lot of accounting practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| and budget practices that I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| So when I start to look at the budget as it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| I need to frame it in a way that I can start to get a handle on what really is central management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| And that's not an easy thing from people who have done research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| I mean, some of the best researchers in the United States are still grasping, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| grappling with what is central management exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| So at least for us, around here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| I have some simple ideas that I'm trying to assign numbers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| So I'm just, I'm wrestling with the size, the cost, the efficiency of our, of what we call central management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| And I'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I think that's good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| I think it's, you know, I'm certainly in favor, I may be in favor of a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| Once I get that, you know, some kind of satisfactory interpretation of what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| so that I can get my head around it and say, okay, all this stuff that possibly that I have observed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| or been biased towards or against, it's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| And so when you're in the public, when you're in the political realm, you've got to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| there's a lot of stuff that you get exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And there was a lawyer friend, used to be a lawyer friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| I don't think he's a friend anymore, but he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Norman, you just don't want to know what goes on about certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| And so some of that, I don't want to know what's going on, it's where I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| And so I'm just trying to get by that, but I'm certainly not, I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| and I don't like the phrase a lot of times, oh, we all want the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| Well, I think we do all want better schools, and we certainly want better for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| And we can all say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| And certainly that's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I'm certainly not trying to be just a disruptive influence on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| So that's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| And just by the way, Dr. McIntyre informed me that my second request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| I had another correspondence that I forwarded to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| and that will be coming shortly, here within a couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| and that will be back out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| I guess I'm trying to figure out where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| We're in, okay, city, county, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| But in terms of the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| We have finished the public forum, and he had asked for a discussion item about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| So unless there's other discussion, we're ready to move on to Commissioner Wright's discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| So I'd like to, tell me if I'm getting outside of the parameters of this discussion, and I'll relent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| No, go ahead, because this is discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| So you're, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| And I just have a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| Dr. McIntyre, could you come up, and, again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| it's kind of like that doing math in public thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I'm hating to put you on the spot there, but it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| just a couple general questions that will help me frame the present state of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5977)|
| 1:39:49| I mean, when you gave your state of the schools address, I thought I was an educational commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| and I kind of understood the state we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| But when you gave some of those numbers, you gave a lot of great numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| and then you had that infamous but, and I do appreciate that, and what came after that startled me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| So to dig deeper in that, and that's kind of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| could you help me understand, if possible, state assessment tests is where I'm going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6014)|
| 1:40:23| the former definition of proficient, zero to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| Could you tell me what that minimum proficiency was, say, five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| whenever we, prior to starting this, and where it is today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Is that kind of too simple of a question to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| I know it's convoluted in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| I can try to give you some perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| I'm Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| Commissioner and Chairman Hammond, I think probably the best way to think about the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| and how that worked is to look at the numbers a couple years back when we still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| before we moved to higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Part of the impetus for moving to higher standards was this gap between what we saw in terms of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| scoring proficient on Tennessee assessments that measured Tennessee standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| versus those same children taking a national assessment based on more rigorous national standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| So there's the TCAP assessments a few years back, just roughly speaking, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6082)|
| 1:41:30| Tennessee students scored roughly about 90% of them scored proficient or advanced on our TCAP assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| Statewide, and it varied a little bit, a couple percentage points here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| depending on grade level or subject area, but basically about 90% of our students in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| were proficient or advanced on TCAP assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| If you took those same students and had them take the NAEP, the National Assessment of Educational Progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| sometimes called the Nation's Report Card, only about 27% of those students were proficient or advanced on the NAEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| which measured a more rigorous national standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| That was really the gap that we were looking at at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| and that's really that difference began to, I think, catalyze a lot of interest and support around really raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| our academic standards from where they were, which was literally among the lowest in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| to where they are today, which is among the highest academic standards in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| So that was really the gap that we were looking at, and so when we moved to higher academic standards in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| again, rough numbers depending on the grade level and subject area, but the new standards that measure proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6153)|
| 1:42:41| I think it's fair to say we're probably closer to about 35% to 40% of our students achieving proficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| or advanced status on the TCAP assessment now versus 90% just a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6170)|
| 1:42:57| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| That's a startlingly low number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| It is, but it was the right thing to do, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I mean, I think we want to measure our, and I was just so glad to hear so many people say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| we need to measure our performance in a realistic and meaningful way against not just other students in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| not just other students across the state of Tennessee, but really our kids are going to be competing for jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| and other opportunities with students from around the country and around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| and so we need to make sure that they're prepared, and I think in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| it was a hard thing for us to do as a state, but in order for us to do that, we need to know where we really stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| and that's what we've done, and then it is pretty eye-opening when you say 47% of our third graders are proficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| or advanced in English language arts or reading last year on the TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| That's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| We're certainly seeing progress, and we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| In fact, we saw gains in TCAP scores on all four subject areas last year from the year before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| but the gap is still there that we need to close, and the budget that the Board of Education has adopted is really our strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| to close that gap, to invest in our kids and in our future, and to really provide the level of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| that our students are going to need to be prepared for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| And I guess, you know, as I dig into this, and I don't think the superintendent would argue with the fact that I've not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6258)|
| 1:44:27| kind of a flying ointment as far as central staff, and we had long conversations about that last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| but I really think we need to, for the purposes of where we are today, delink those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| We can have that conversation, and I'm all for having that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| But in anyone's model, if we use, you know, Commissioner Norman's model or someone else's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6286)|
| 1:44:55| some great school system in Timbuktu's model, we're not talking about the kind of transformation that this budget could give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6295)|
| 1:45:08| should give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| So, you know, I think, you know, as we go forward, and I'm ready to have some serious conversations about education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6309)|
| 1:45:19| about education in Knox County, about what our role is, and we're in our lane now, what our role is in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6319)|
| 1:45:31| When you throw too many parameters out there, I think it just muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I think we need to talk about this, and then let's talk about the central staff in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| and let's look at the models, and let's look at the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| But I think for the purposes of this, we need to talk about what this budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6347)|
| 1:45:55| what this $35 million is going toward and what it's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| And I guess I'll close by saying I really appreciate not only the newspaper, but I appreciate the zip codes I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6360)|
| 1:46:10| There's a lot of diversity in terms of where people came from to come down here in downtown Knoxville to have this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| and I think that's extremely important as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| And I'll say, and I mean this, folks on the other side, show up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| Come and tell us why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| We're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| We're going to be listening a lot during the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| I mean, it's easy to anonymously blog, and I'll read those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| I'm guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| I'll be the one out there reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Everyone says I never read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| I do every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| But I would rather hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Eyeball to eyeball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Tell me why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| I want to know both sides of the argument from the people that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| So, you know, folks, I'm sure with all of us, they don't mind stopping us in Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| so we'll ask you to continue to stop us in the Kroger and the Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| But, you know, come here and in your own way tell us why you feel what you feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| and I do think this lady and these gentlemen will hear you out and internalize what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6432)|
| 1:47:21| But I'm really pleased with the conversation that we're having thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Yes, this is to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| And really what I keep hearing from people in our district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| we can talk about we're spending too much on janitors, we're spending too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| I'm just saying arguments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| We're spending too much on schools that the school board says we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| We're spending too much on the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| But the bottom line is that I think people want results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| And if building a new school makes you have results, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| If spending more money in the central office makes the scores higher, then that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| You know, where do you spend the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| That's your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| But what I want to know is that at the end of five years when this program is fully implemented, how do we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| how would the taxpayers know they've gotten their money's worth out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| You mentioned something about the NAP, what was it, the NAPA test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| NAPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| NAPE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| NAPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| N-A-E-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| The NAPA test, what years are those given in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| I mean, because that's a national standardized test that we can compare ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| It's a national assessment, but it's given to a small sample of students in every state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| And the results are compared state by state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| So they're not compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| There's a couple of large metropolitan areas that are in a trial for looking at whether that data would be statistically significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| to compare school district to school district, but they don't do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| They're state to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| So when I was talking with, responding to Commissioner McKenzie, that was really Tennessee statewide results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| versus the NAPE results that we saw compared to other, the standards that are set in place for the NAPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| Well, you know, I guess really what my question is, is over five years you're asking us to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| I'm going to do some, take some risk here, I am going to do some public math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| but it's going to be $175 million sold for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| And what people are asking me, how do we know, how are we measuring the students as they go along that things are getting better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6562)|
| 1:49:31| Are we using ACT scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| I mean, is there some other measure that we're using that every student takes that we can look at Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| and say that at the end of five years, the $175 million that we spend was worth it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6580)|
| 1:49:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| And I think that's a great question and one that I think we are prepared to really answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| When the Board of Education adopted its strategic plan, excellence for all children, in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| we set out to define quantitatively what success looked like and define really a whole page full of metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| that we think are meaningful to measure our progress and our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| And if you look, this is the year two progress report on our strategic plan, you see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I would highlight two of those, and there are several others that I think are useful to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| but two that I think are really important metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| One is the third grade reading statistic that we talked about, scoring proficient or advanced on the third grade TCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6631)|
| 1:50:40| English Language Arts and Reading Assessment, and where are we on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| And what we believe and know from research and experience is that the specific educational initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| that the Board of Education has adopted in this budget will make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| a positive impact on student achievement in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| And then the other is the Board of Education put sort of this top line goal out there, it's called 190-90-90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| It's 100% of our students finishing high school, at least 90% graduating with a regular diploma as opposed to a GED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6666)|
| 1:51:13| or something else, at least 90% of our graduates taking the ACT assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| and at least 90% of our students who take the ACT scoring a 21 or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| 21 is a good measure that shows that our students acquired the knowledge and skills they need for their future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| at just sort of a foundational level, and it also opens some doors for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| And that's a lot of statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| That's four different statistics, but if you sort of compile those all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| if you take 90% times 90% times 90%, we want to see at least 73% of our incoming freshmen graduate four years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6698)|
| 1:51:48| with a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| Where we are right now is at 38%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| It's gone up from 34% the last two years, but, you know, so we're making good, solid academic progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| but we're still very far away from the goal that the Board of Education has set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| So I think those two statistics are really important ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| And really what we expect to see in terms of success is that our current trend line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| the trajectory of those outcomes changes substantially to move so that we meet the goals that we've set in our strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| and that we actually accomplish the very ambitious goals that the board adopted in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| You know, I just have two other comments is that, you know, two of those four things of the 90-90-90-90 plan are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6748)|
| 1:52:38| that can be manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| I mean, high school diplomas, you know, they may mean something, but there's still a lot of people that graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| that can't perform a lot of the skills that they need to go on for further education or do jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| The ACT is indisputable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| If we can get 90% of our kids to take the ACT and 90% of them are making 21, that's a national test that has a national standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6773)|
| 1:53:04| And so those, you know, what I would not like is to come back in five years and say, well, we've hit the first two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| but the last two we haven't because the first two can be manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| No, and Commissioner, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| That's why I prefer to compile them into a single statistic because I think that's more meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| How many of our incoming freshmen graduate four years later with a 21 or better on the ACT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| And I think that gives you graduation rate and the ACT score integrated into a single metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| And then my final comment deals with what is actually in the plan is too often you don't have to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| I know there's other school districts in this country that are getting very good results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| and particularly the school districts outside of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| You know, people talk about what's happening in Finland, what's happening in Korea and other places that students score much higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6825)|
| 1:53:53| especially in the basic STEM issues that have more to do with the future of the country than some of the liberal arts issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| But when you modeled your five-year program, did we reinvent the wheel that's a custom-made program for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6840)|
| 1:54:09| or is this taken as a compilation of what other school districts elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| I'm sure that as an education professional, you have the opportunity to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| But really, where did the plan come from, and what makes you think that this is going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| Yeah, and the plan comes from – the budget comes from our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| It really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| If you look at this budget, I guess fairly remarkably, all of the items that are in there are in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| They're the things that we said we were going to do, but the things that we've struggled to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| And so, yeah, we look at best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| We look at the research and the educational literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Things like more instructional time is a key learning from other places around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| We don't have enough time with our students in the classroom to get to the level of depth of knowledge that we need to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6892)|
| 1:55:00| So, I mean, I think when you look at the types of educational initiatives that are proposed in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| and there are nine of them, and I'd be glad to spend some time talking about what those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and the rationale behind them if this is the appropriate time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| It may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| But, you know, things like additional instructional time, things like having instructional technology that's going to be supportive of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| Interventions and enrichment for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Additional supports for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| I think the other thing that we've modeled a lot on what we see in successful programs around the country and around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| is making sure that we have high-quality instruction in every day, in every classroom every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| And to do that, you have to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| One, you have to have high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| And I think we've done that in the state of Tennessee with the new performance evaluation that we've put in place for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| And the second is then you put in place the supports and the resources and the tools for your teachers to be able to meet those high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6947)|
| 1:55:56| To make sure that they have the professional development and the support that they need to really meet those high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| So, I feel like, you know, and again, I'm glad to talk about the budget in any level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| I know we're going to have lots more conversation about it as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| But we are very careful to look at what we believe from research and from our experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| what we know from research and from our experience are going to make an impact on student learning and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| And those are in this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| You know, I've talked with you about some of these before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| And I know we'll have an opportunity in other forums to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| But this is a chance for it to be in front of the public and on televisions while I'm asking some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Because these are the questions that are coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| And one final issue that always comes up when I'm talking to people in the public, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| there's always this argument about what is the most influential effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| or the most influential point on a child's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| And some people will say the school, the school teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Some people will say the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Some people may say the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| But my personal belief is it's probably the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| And, you know, what in this plan do we do to try to integrate the parents more into the education of the child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7023)|
| 1:57:11| Is there something we're going to try to do different there that we've not done before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| Yeah, there absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| And I think there's a couple of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Probably the best example of that is the community schools initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| the work that we've done at Pond Gap Elementary School to begin this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| And this really is an initiative brought together by a number of different partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| the University of Tennessee, a generous donation by Randy Boyd funded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| But the idea is to work with our parents and with our students to try to, I guess the best way to say it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7056)|
| 1:57:44| first of all, we extend the school day so there's more opportunity for learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| But then also to try to bring, to make the school the center of the community so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| and provide or broker services and supports for students and for families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| so that you minimize the distractions to learning for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| So that when they come to the classroom, they're ready to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| And really partnering with our parents, you know, offering English as a second language classes at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| or, you know, we serve dinner for the whole family to come on weeknights at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| And so, you know, bringing in parents into the school in ways that maybe they wouldn't otherwise be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| Bringing them in for workshops or maybe legal service assistance or other things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| that can really provide some support, family literacy classes that can provide some support to the entire family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| and can minimize the distractions to learning so that our students are focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| and able to be successful in the classroom when they get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| This is an initiative that not only brings our parents and our families into the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| and really into the educational process, which is important, but also brings our community in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| which is also vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| We've got lots of community organizations and individuals who are just really chomping at the bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| to be a part of the community schools initiative as we look to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| And can really, a relatively small investment on the part of the schools in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| can really leverage a lot of community resources that are ready to pour into some of our schools that need it most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Dr. McIntyre, thank you for being here, but I'm going to revisit one of the speakers that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7155)|
| 1:59:25| Mr. Lavage, what was the number that you used on the, I'm going back through my notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| and I think I've written this down wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| The dollar figure you used as a per student expense in Knox County is 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7173)|
| 1:59:42| 7,543.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| I did write it down right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| No other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| We'll move on to our next discussion item, and that was from Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| You had asked for a briefing from our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I've had a couple of phone calls the last day or two and conversations at Kroger's and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| about the new Statehouse District 89 seat and what the law director is doing on behalf of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7204)|
| 2:00:16| and the dilemma or discussion that we've got going on about a person being qualified or not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| I get questions like, who are you representing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| Or if you go before a judge, usually it's two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| Are you on one side or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Help me with what do I need to be saying to people that are wanting to know Knox County's position in this qualification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7236)|
| 2:00:45| this candidate's qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Yes, sir, Commissioner Wright and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| In a nutshell, during the course of reviewing petitions to be placed on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| we had our local Knox County Election Commission suspicion that Ms. Breeding may not in fact be a Knox County resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7256)|
| 2:01:04| because her home at least partially appears to exist in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| They then contacted the State Elections Commission, and their opinion was that they're of the mind that she probably is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7269)|
| 2:01:19| qualified candidate because they believe she probably, and again, these are the qualifiers they're using, lives in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| They then directed the local election commission to present it to, during a formal meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| to determine whether or not they either want to qualify her as a candidate or ask the court to make a determination as to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| viability of her candidacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| Now, they were empowered last week to make that decision themselves because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| their duty is to ensure that qualified people get on the ballot and, likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| to preclude non-qualified people being on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| The vote was three to two to ask me to file an action in court seeking the court's advice on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| Now, under Tennessee code, the law director represents the local election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| So what I filed is called a declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| That's not an antagonistic pleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| In other words, we're not asking the court to keep her on the ballot nor put her on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| Under a declaratory judgment action, you're asking the court to basically make a ruling and determine the rights of the party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7337)|
| 2:02:25| in this case, determine whether or not Ms. Breeding is, in fact, a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| So the case would be styled Knox County Election Commission versus Ms. Breeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| but in the body of the complaint, it asks the court to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| It does not advocate one way or the other what that decision should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| Unlike a normal lawsuit, when you ask for relief, you normally ask the court to rule in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| Here, it's requesting that the court determine whether or not she should remain on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| So in my Krogerese or Food City, you, as one voice, have thrown all this stuff on the bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7378)|
| 2:03:09| and they're going to say something, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| I'm not sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| You're taking all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| Oh, yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| The court makes a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| I use the word stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| You're taking all the facts as we know them, as everyone has presented it to you and placed it in front of the bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7402)|
| 2:03:30| and they're going to say this person can or cannot be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| That is clearly set before the court for their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| And that's the question I've been asked, and I appreciate your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| No, just so you know, you would think rationally that, well, why don't you just do a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| and that began some of the woes we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| Two professional surveyors both said we can't survey the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| The boundary markers are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| They go back over 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| We'd have to essentially survey an entire segment of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| which could take an amazing amount of time, an amazing amount of monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| and they still couldn't validate whether or not they can come to a decision, hence evoking the powers of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| That's one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| I've not been following this line by line, so pardon me if it's been out there in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| But who do you, I don't know if she's married or not, who does she pay property taxes to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| She pays her property taxes to Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| and that was one of the reasons why the election commission, state election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| suspicion there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| The problem we have is the statute is vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| It lists multiple indicia of residency, that being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| That's one of the documents I attacked to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| But she votes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| Yeah, there's actually, my understanding is that there's six, and under five of those she qualifies as a Knox County resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7486)|
| 2:04:54| and under one of them she qualifies as Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| She pays her wheel tax and her reel tax, all of that is paid in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| but her property taxes are paid through her mortgage to Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| So, yeah, she's a registered voter and has served on jury duty here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| and she's been a registered voter here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| Oh, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| I wanted to ask a question when we're going to move on to the next, I mean, if we're through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| Yes, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| We're going to move on to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| I'm about to reach the, I probably have 10 or 15 more minutes of my physical capacity to sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| and is there a discussion item on the at large seats and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Well, Commissioner Wright wanted to go ahead and address it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| It was about redistricting and whether there should be the makeup we have now to put on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7545)|
| 2:05:52| to recommend to the Charter Review that maybe they look at expanding commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| doing away with the at large seat, keeping it as is, any number of ways to restructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| So Commissioner Burrell said she asked to withdraw it, but now Commissioner Wright has said since you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| let's go ahead and have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Right, and I'm not really interested in the discussion in that great a depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| What I'm looking for, I think, is that just as we've talked, I'll use the other example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7575)|
| 2:06:23| the uniformed officer's pension plan is going to be taken up by the Charter Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| The size of commission districts, are we going to take that up as commission for a ballot initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7590)|
| 2:06:42| or are we going to leave that with the Charter Review Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| That's really what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| As we get into next Wednesday, the Charter Committee meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| This Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| This Wednesday, not next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Well, next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| Two days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7621)|
| 2:07:02| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| So the discussion I would like to hear or see discussion about is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7624)|
| 2:07:12| or not the size of commission districts, is it going to be something we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| or are we going to then leave that with the Charter Review Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| Or does anybody have to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Or that's correct, but someone, I think, has to do something because I'm on the side that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| that the commission districts are rather large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| Representation, in other words, has been cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| And this is an issue that has been talked about in the terms of, well, the voters decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| but we've had the voters decide lots of things, and now we need to look at things individually, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| And I'm just asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| Are we going to discuss it here and bring something out of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| or should we rely on the large citizen group to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| I agree with Mr. Wright as far as when it was cut back, cut the representation in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7692)|
| 2:08:20| but I want to point out one thing, actually two in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| in the fact that we just recently put the school board district the same as the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7704)|
| 2:08:32| If we tried to do that and maintain that, we would be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7712)|
| 2:08:38| because I think the state law limits school district board members to 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| so we'd be limited to 13 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| That would be an uneven number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| And I will say this, that the more districts means better representation for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7729)|
| 2:09:00| I mean, you and Commissioner Shouse have had a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| or more now of trying to run around all over the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| It's difficult, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| It's time consuming, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| It's difficult but time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Well, that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| But by having the additional, well, two in this case, each one representing a specific district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| they would be smaller and people would have better representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| Plus the fact that the more districts you have, the smaller they are, the more people can afford to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7771)|
| 2:09:39| Both of you all ran at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| I don't know what you spent, but I know what some of us spent as far as running in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| When you start running at large, you're talking about a considerable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| I mean, there's hundreds of people in Knox County that are qualified to sit in these chairs up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| but they can't afford to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| But if you've got smaller districts, then they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| In 1899, Knox County had 25 districts with 59,500 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| And now we have 400,000 people in nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| So, I mean, granted, we're not riding horses today and buggies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| but it still takes the same amount of time in a lot of cases to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| When you get on the interstate and get bogged down in traffic, you're almost better off with a horse and buggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| So there's a lot of things to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| I think it has a lot of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| Commissioner Norman, did you want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Not on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| I just, Mike, would you, Mr. Chairman, would you brief me again on our schedule as regards school budget issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7847)|
| 2:10:59| As far as I can tell, we have nothing on our calendar until May 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| May 1st is when the mayor will present his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| The mayor is putting together a series of budget meetings in each of the nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| I don't have that schedule yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| All the commissioners will be invited to go to those district meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| And the public will be invited to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| May the 16th, we will have budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| The commission will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| And I believe we start at 830 and we'll go until they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| I'm sure, you know, the schools will be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| But our main focus will be on May the 22nd when we have the joint meeting with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| which we said we would do in our retreat, to go over any other budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| And then on the 20th, we have our regular workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| And this is something I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| When we have our workshop on the third Monday of May, I anticipate a number of people coming wanting to discuss the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7916)|
| 2:12:05| So we're going to need to set aside time for public comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| My thinking would be we would do that after we have our workshop and just say that, you know, people who want to sign up can sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7930)|
| 2:12:19| We will meet on the Tuesday after Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| I fully expect we'll have what we had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| I'm sure people are going to want to come and talk about the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| So I bring that up because I think we need to have the discussion on we want to make sure that people have an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| to express their points of view, but we also don't want folks to come and sit for two or three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| So if we could maybe look at a specified time or a time frame, then that way people could –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| because we did not anticipate that we would have 15 people come in today at 145 wanting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| We just didn't – you know, that's not what that's designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| So, Commissioner McKenzie, you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| I would just ask that in light of what the Chairman just said, if – I don't want to twist any arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7979)|
| 2:13:07| but if there are issues that can wait to June, proclamations or maybe nonessential resolutions that can be put off 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7987)|
| 2:13:17| let's think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| We have – May is going to be an extremely busy month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| And the more time we can put toward the budget, I think the better off we'll all be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| So, you know, we can all kind of go home and think about things that we were planning on presenting in May, if it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| If it can't, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| But if it can, let's hold off until June so we can talk about budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| You know, I suppose I guess my thoughts revolve around this space that we've got between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8022)|
| 2:13:51| and essentially we won't take up school budget issues except in sort of a cursory way to accommodate the people at these other meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8031)|
| 2:14:03| the community meetings or the mayor's budget meetings, whatever those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| But this body does not take up school budget essentially until the workshop on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8049)|
| 2:14:17| No, the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| No, we have budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Those are budget hearings, but that's departmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Those are departmental reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| The schools will just be a part, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| And that's the 830, starts at 830, goes throughout the day, that thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Well, I just, it was just, I just feel like we, and this is a bad time to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8079)|
| 2:14:46| I should have brought it up last month, but I didn't see this gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| To me, there's a three-week gap or almost a month here where we really need to be talking about it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| I'm just offering it out here to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| I just see it as a lull that it's going to start up there the 21st, 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8103)|
| 2:15:12| We're going to be getting into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| And then we've got a special called meeting to approve the budget on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| I just don't, you know, I wish we had something in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Not knowing the schedule of the district meetings was a factor in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8123)|
| 2:15:30| But we can certainly have a, once we get that, we can look and go ahead and have a meeting, probably in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| just to talk specifically about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| If you all would like to do that, we'll look at that schedule and see if we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Then I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| As soon as I get the schedule from the mayor's office, we'll set another meeting to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| and we'll focus just on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| And it won't necessarily be a joint meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| We're going to do that the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| This will be just for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Mr. Chairman, can I make a suggestion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| We did this last time, and he went from here and went straight out to Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| And we didn't know that he was even coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| People didn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| And I think he's going to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| Can administration, can we check with administration, can they publicize, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| when and where they're going to be so people will have time to react?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| Because Halls is a very large community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| and I think they want to voice their opinion on this, as other communities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| But I sort of hate to be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| As I understand it, he's going to address this, what, at 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| and he's going to be at Halls at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| Well, who has time to react to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| But if it's been notified when and where he's going, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| And he would have better attendance at these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| I'll talk with him and see if we can get some kind of schedule here quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| Mr. Chairman, on the same subject, while we're talking about this, for the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| would there be an evening or a time, would it be appropriate now to give some potential dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8211)|
| 2:16:59| Something to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Some of the colleagues here would not be able to make, say, a 6 o'clock meeting one evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8221)|
| 2:17:10| I'd just like to see if there's something in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| I don't have much on my calendar in the early part of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| and so there's practically no time other than the Charter Review Wednesday meeting that I couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8239)|
| 2:17:28| So I just wanted to let that be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| And if there's other people that are in places where they've got some things concreted into their schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| they can't get out of, but that would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| You know, an early evening meeting would suit me just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8262)|
| 2:17:49| If you have any conflicts, let Jolie know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| And once I find out that schedule, then I'll get with Jolie and we'll send out the notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8271)|
| 2:17:58| and then we'll just call the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| Anything else to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| If not, we are adjourned until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8284)|
| 2:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8293)|
| 2:18:25| It's time now for the zoning portion of our Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| Clerk, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8308)|

| 2:18:47| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| We have two items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Clerk, if you'd read item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| Request of Graham Corporation for Northwest City Sector Plan Amendment from O office to C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| commercial property located southeast side of O Callahan Drive, north of Clinton Highway, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8337)|
| 2:19:05| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| I'd like a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| Request of Graham Corporation for rezoning from A, agricultural and R, B, general residential to C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| B, business and manufacturing property located southeast side, O Callahan Drive, north of Clinton Highway, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8363)|
| 2:19:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| On this one, the staff recommended P.C. rather than C.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| And I'd like to make a substitute motion to go with P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| Hopefully I can get a second and then we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| And I'd like for Buzz to describe what the difference is and the reason why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8399)|
| 2:20:06| The staff recommended P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| The planning commission approved C.B. in the county portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| In the county portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| We can't do anything with the city portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| The staff recommended P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| The planning commission approved C.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Yeah, this is just in the county portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8419)|
| 2:20:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| I'll second it for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Could you give us the discussion or the description why staff recommended P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| over C.B. in that county portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| Commissioners, if you look at your zoning map under the zoning recommendation report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8444)|
| 2:20:52| you notice that the properties that were subject to other rezoning and planning member requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| are in an area where we have in the city the planned commercial one zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| and in the county the planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| So this particular area had already seen the benefit of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| and planning under zones that do require MPC review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| If I could, just as a matter of information, the city zoning that was a part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8479)|
| 2:21:28| that zone was already P.C. one planned commercial in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| and they requested the C.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| And staff recommended denial of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| That was also approved by commission for C.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| But in the case of the county, you were starting out essentially with agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| and R.B., general residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| And, again, for the reasoning that you already had a planned commercial pattern established there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8513)|
| 2:22:01| on both sides of Callahan Drive north of Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| and the staff felt like that it was appropriate to try to continue some consistency with the zoning that was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8526)|
| 2:22:15| and allow site plans to continue to be reviewed so that they could all fit together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8535)|
| 2:22:22| and have the planning commission and staff a chance to work with the applicants on how those might be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8542)|
| 2:22:31| But the planning commission did vote in favor of their request for C.B., business and manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8551)|
| 2:22:39| The primary difference between those two zones is planned commercial requires a site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| C.B., business and manufacturing does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| And that's pretty much the real difference between those two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| So, Buzz, it would still be possible on Callahan for, say, a light manufacturing to take place even under P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8574)|
| 2:23:04| We would just have a plan review process to accommodate it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| Yeah, the P.C. zone is kind of a broad zone in terms of definition of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8589)|
| 2:23:15| You pretty much establish what those uses are at the zoning stage, actually at the development plan stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8595)|
| 2:23:24| by having private covenants adopted that will identify exactly how that property is going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8604)|
| 2:23:34| But you essentially can, you know, in a very quick background on it, you can essentially do one and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8614)|
| 2:23:44| It's just that the C.B. does not require the site plan review by M.P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| That's the reason why I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| I still think that planning is a good, good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| So the motion on the floor is to approve with M.P.C. recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| The substitute motion is to go to a different zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Just to go with the M.P.C. staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Correct, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| The substitute would go with the M.P.C. staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Which is P.C. rather than C.B. in the county portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Arthur, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| Just very briefly, the reason we requested C.B. for this tract is it's barely two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8661)|
| 2:24:28| P.C. is designed for larger tracts of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Mr. Graham does not know, and his son, Rob Graham, is here, what the ultimate use of the property will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| It's a small tract fronting on Old Callahan Road, and we wanted to be as flexible as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8681)|
| 2:24:48| Covenants can get very expensive in producing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| It may be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| It could be incorporated into the existing center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| There's no immediate plan for it, but C.B. allows the most flexible use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| That's why we asked for C.B., and this property is sort of chopped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8704)|

| 2:25:17| And for this two-acre tract, Mr. Graham wanted C.B. so he could be flexible going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120423?start=8717)|
