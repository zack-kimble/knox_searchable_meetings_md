| 0:01:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=112)|

| 0:01:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| All members being present, we would move on to the approval of minutes of our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Is there a motion to approve them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Moving on to item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Any items to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| I would like to ask for a postponement of item 9B, and that is the solicitation ordinance ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| And the reason for that postponement, I'd like to ask for a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| The reason for that is Council did have a workshop on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| We discussed it at length that night, and one of the issues was the safety in these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| We looked at this ordinance that dated back to the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Many of the intersections that were proposed as replacements didn't feel safe, didn't feel good to various councilmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| Since we voted on this on first reading two weeks ago, obviously there's been, I think many of us have received phone calls and emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| We've got a lot of folks down here tonight who are concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| And I'd like to have longer to study the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Particularly, I'd like to know best practices in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| I'd like to know what other cities our size have done with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| Do they still feel like it's safe to issue a permit and send folks into an intersection to do these solicitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| Do they manage it in a way differently that we haven't considered yet under our current ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| And I'd like more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| So I'd like to propose a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| There's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And there's a second from Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Well, this is actually a different light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| But I guess the only concern I have is we obviously have a lot of people in the audience here on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| And I don't want to ‑‑I think there was some discussion of a postponement that folks heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| But I don't want to discount anybody who showed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I hate to inconvenience anyone who has come down tonight with a concern about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| It's my overriding concern, though, that's the reason for my postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| It's not out of any disrespect for anyone who has come down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| But to be able to make a better, more informed decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| I'd like more information and more time to get some research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Actually, this light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Oh, it's a different light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I was just looking at the agenda, making sure we didn't skip over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I agree with Councilwoman Roddy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| I think that postponement is appropriate under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| And I think the idea of looking at best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| and seeing what peer cities are doing is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| And perhaps we can enlist the help of MTAS or, you know, other organizations, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| but certainly MTAS in researching that and finding out what others are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| And that's why I'm asking for four weeks, not two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| to try to give some ample time to get some better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Anybody else on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I'm not sure, and I've been out of town a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| but I'm not sure if we have any available already set aside workshop dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| between now and within the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| So council needs to be prepared if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| If you want to have a workshop on this issue during this period of this postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| then we would have to pick another date and another time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| and people need to make themselves available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| I don't know if we've checked on that, but I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| we've got maybe one or two between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I know we've got a couple of things already booked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| so I just want to make sure we're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| And I don't know if we've booked it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| I've been kind of out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I'm open to a longer postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| If, you know, if we think we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| We've had one workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| If we think we need a second workshop based on, you know, more information, peer study information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| we could postpone longer than four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| I just wanted to make sure that we weren't leaving the impression that we were going to do something like a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| and then came back in four weeks and didn't do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Let me say, and I hope that as we work through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| that we work through this process in a way that's beneficial for all, in a way that's respectful of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| The one thing that kind of concerns me, and I really struggle with not to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| is that the workshops we had earlier, I think, was very, very clear that this council was looking at this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| not from a vantage point of favoring one organization over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I've seen e-mails that kind of imply that maybe some organization has gotten to council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| that doesn't like another organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| And also I think it's not quite fair for council to be portrayed as being against the great kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| that the organizations that do this kind of fundraising are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| You know, in some circles we're being portrayed quite frankly as if we're against Ma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Malpapai, and Chevrolet, and that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| None of that came into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| I don't think there's a member on this council who is not concerned about helping the kind of kids that the Shriners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| help or that the firefighters help or that other organizations help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| or want to help some of the nonprofits that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| You know, it truly was an issue and a concern for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| And while I can't speak for all of council, I wanted to speak for myself and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| as we move forward through this process, the best way is to figure out, if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| a win-win for everybody without trying to do it in such a way that it tends to impugn people's rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| and reasons for doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| And so hopefully we move forward in that vein and not in the vein of as if there is some sort of hidden agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| The only agenda that I see is trying to do the right thing for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| and make sure that we protect the citizens of our city while also making sure that those folks who are in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| get the services and support from the organizations that are supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Councilwoman Pelo, and then I'll come to Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Well, I just want to thank the vice mayor for the comments he has just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| and I certainly don't want to repeat them or in any way diminish the comments he's made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| but I certainly want to say I appreciate that because it's very important to us on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| that it is well understood that we are looking to the total issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| and certainly has nothing to do with singling out one group or another group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| and the importance or lack of in our minds of the work that is being done by these wonderful agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| and the work that's been done for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| So this is a very serious deliberation that we will be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| And if we do postpone it, my only concern is I just, you know, I appreciate all the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| I appreciate all of the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| I appreciate the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| But I just would hope it would be understood that I'm speaking for myself personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| I take a decision on this very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| and will take into consideration all the citizens of Knoxville and the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| and other issues that are involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| And I appreciate what Councilman Brown has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| because I do think some of us have felt that our personal values and our personal sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| I guess I will say charity for lack of a better word, has been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| And so thank you, Vice Mayor Brown, for so eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Well, I was just following up on the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| By my calendar, we have a workshop available on the 29th, which would be before the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| I guess there's just a question of if there is interest in doing a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| If it feels like if there is, we might want to talk about that now while everybody's in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| I don't know if there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| It may not be the issue to cover now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| but I just wanted to make sure that if that is one of the things that is being contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| we need to be very aware of our time constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Maybe that's something we just visit later on through our regular process of is that date truly available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| and also is it something we need to do or do we need to get all this information, share it with ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| and with representatives from agencies that are interested, you know, about some of the best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| so that they can see the kind of information we're looking at also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I think that's very beneficial in a shared, shared kind of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| that we let them see the same kind of information we're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| whether it's information that they like or that we like or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| I think that way they will see, whoever their representatives are or those that are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| that way they can see the kind of information we are gathering that we're going to use in trying to make our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| And I don't know how we gather it, where it's going to be gathered at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| who's going to be ultimately responsible for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| but maybe Councilwoman Roddy has an idea and can suggest that to the city recorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| on how we go about doing that and gathering that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| But I do think it may be beneficial to make that available to anyone who wants to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| And that was my question about who would we ask to prepare some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| background in terms of best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Do you have an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| You know, I think Councilman Holquist's suggestion that we look and ask for some guidance initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| I think also to the city law department in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| how do other peer cities handle this issue with safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| You know, my concern is when we issue a permit, you know, to me then there's an implication of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Enforcement and forgiveness and permission to do this in a safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| And I just didn't have a comfort level as of our last workshop that we were there with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| with our current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So I think it would need to be some kind of joint task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| You know, we probably would need assistance from the Knoxville Police Department as well as law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| and maybe MTAS and maybe representatives from council and just try to pull together some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| And, you know, in that case, four weeks may not be long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| We do have that one workshop date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| but whether or not we can pull that information between now and the 29th of November, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| I would tend to go on the short side and go with a four-week postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| and then if we need longer, postpone it again to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| But I'm at the discretion of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Mayor, one of my questions would be, in terms of the timing of the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| how this would affect those that have requested a permit or those that have permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| And I need to understand a little bit more about the status of permits so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| so that those that are interested in moving forward can go ahead and make their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| and we need to get our business in order first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Until the ordinance is changed, everything is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| So they can go out tomorrow, next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Well, I wouldn't want to come up and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| if we continue down the path we went the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| it would affect what they're planning on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| So I think we need to get our business in order so that they can make their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| And I think that's how we ought to look at the timing of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Well, in response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| one of the things that we could do if we were to pass this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| at some point on second reading as it reads now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| we could adjust the time to which it takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| It wouldn't have to take effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| It could be six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| It could be a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I mean, we've got plenty of leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| So we've got the opportunity to give people time, groups time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| to change their business plans, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And, you know, if we chose to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| I think there are other things we're going to have to look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and maybe the law department can help us in terms of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| there's no way we can discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| If 100 groups want to do this, then if it gets more and more popular, we can't say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| unless we set up a lottery, you know, only so many groups, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| restricted to weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| I mean, there are a lot of things we're going to have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| and maybe the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| maybe the engineering department can help us with some of those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| The motion and the second on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| There's obviously a lot of folks that have come here tonight, and we appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| I think what you've heard from council is your presence, what we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| is taken very seriously, and people want to hear that and think that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| They're not ducking the question because you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It's just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| They're saying we want to look at this in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So anything else from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| And, council, there are three or four folks to sign up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| but obviously that will be null and void if this gets postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=866)|

| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I heard nine ayes and zero noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| That item will be postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Obviously, you can we will have some discussion about it in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I wanted to return to item number A, the withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| I move that item number 12N be withdrawn from the agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| 12N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| And I will just go on and state that is at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| And that's at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| It was seconded by Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Any further discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| All those in favor of postponing 12N, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=915)|

| 0:15:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| I think there's also go ahead, Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=932)|

| 0:15:35| Oh, I just understood you wanted to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Second again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I would move that item number 12HH be withdrawn also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Moved and seconded to withdraw 12HH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Any other items to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=957)|

| 0:22:18| I'm here representing the property owner with respect to the matter of the zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1338)|
| 0:22:27| Mr. Mayor, may I approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| You might just let them pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| The time limit still does apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| We don't give you a break for passing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| Were you a lineman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| We'll make sure that gets in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| If you could wait until you get to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Mr. Mayor and Council Members, this is a novel situation to me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1390)|
| 0:23:19| It may not be to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| But this is a question that with regard to the use of property in an I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| this is one of those situations where we're not up here on a zoning appeal or request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| We're up here because we think there's been unfair enforcement in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| This is a case of where my client called me back in September or correction, August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| and Gary Lowe of the Inspections Department had issued a stop order with respect to an automobile repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1434)|
| 0:24:05| And subsequent to that, I went with my client to view the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| which you'll discover is picture one of the exhibit which I've passed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1451)|
| 0:24:22| It was interesting to discover that this was a property which my client had leased to Mexican Enterprises or Latinos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1462)|
| 0:24:36| I don't care which, but they're from Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And Gary Lowe had informed my client there had been a lot of complaints in the neighborhood from the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1482)|
| 0:24:53| and he had to issue that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Well, I went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I'll tell you one of the most interesting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| I went out with my client on September the 19th, the day those pictures were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| In fact, I made those photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| And while I had just arrived, a city car pulled up, slammed on the brakes, and out jumped three people like the Gestapo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1507)|
| 0:25:20| I've never seen anything like having to be the zoning inspector chief and his coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1520)|
| 0:25:29| They wrote up three businesses again, one of which, and you'll see that on the last page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1529)|
| 0:25:40| they wrote up stop orders for two other enterprises, one of which was a grocery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| and said a grocery is not allowed in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Well, I don't know whether it's allowed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| There's another one down the street that didn't receive any stop order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| There's a service station down the street that didn't receive a stop order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| But yet, my client's tenant did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Now, I'm not representing the tenant, I want you to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| But what I'm here is representing a man who leased a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| and wants to be able to use it as other people use their building in an I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| When I was coming down towards town today, I came down Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| and I came to 2538 Sutherland Avenue, which is a convenient market and gas sales in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| At 2607 Sutherland Avenue, I came to Moon's Wrecker Service in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| At 2718 Sutherland Avenue, I came to European Motor Work in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| At 2911 Sutherland Avenue, I came to Buckner's Auto Service in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| At 2940 Sutherland Avenue, I came to Auto Detailing Facility in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| In 3018 Sutherland Avenue, I came to DT's Refurbishing, an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1630)|
| 0:27:18| At 3030 Sutherland Avenue, Abbey's Auto Glass, I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| and then the Chevron convenient market and gas sales in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Well, if those facilities are permitted in an I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| then it appears that somebody in the city of Knoxville believes that those are permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| and permitted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| In fact, in this very facility, on January the 10th, 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1662)|
| 0:27:52| Gary Lowe approved the operation of an auto repair shop in this very location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| He approved it to Don Garrett of the city electrical department, who issued an electrical upgrade permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1681)|
| 0:28:11| And Gary Lowe said that this was a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| Now, one more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Excuse me, how much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Gosh, can I buy any more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Give him two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| There's a motion to give you two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| So you have three more minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Mr. Mayor, under the ordinance, I don't believe the ordinance is quite concise enough to tell you you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1712)|
| 0:28:43| In fact, I think it's broad enough to tell you you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| And certainly our Supreme Court has said that we think property rights come above use restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1728)|
| 0:28:59| where those use restrictions are ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time, if I may, Mr. Mayor, for a rebuttal if that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| You do get a two-minute rebuttal after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Is there anybody that would like to speak against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| We don't have anyone signed up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I'm sorry, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Okay, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1764)|
| 0:29:34| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| My name is Jonathan Schmutz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| I live at 911 East in Skip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I've also got some pictures, if you guys would like to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| You just do the same thing and we'll pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1786)|
| 0:29:58| I've read the zoning ordinance for the I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| and I've counted there's at least 12 to 20 violations that an auto repair shop would affect in being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1804)|
| 0:30:17| And being a homeowner, I really – it's really uncomfortable to have 30 to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1817)|
| 0:30:28| 40 people gathering at midnight, 10 o'clock midnight at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| I really – I don't think it's managed well, and I don't think this being in a residential neighborhood is a good thing to keep property values at a nice level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1834)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Hi, my name is Beth Nelson, and my family lives at 1314 Woodcrest Drive, and we've been there for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| And our – it came to our notice at a neighborhood watch meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| the amount of traffic flow that was created by this business that is in the I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| and it also came to our attention that this is also adjacent to a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| It's not only adjacent to a residential zone, but there's also a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| The bus stops right there for Inskip School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| And after meeting with – speaking with the Board of Zoning Appeals several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| she stated that there was a particular zoning for a transmission auto repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| There is a specific place in an industrial zone for that type business, but it is not in the I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| And so I would like to ask for you to consider that, that there is a place for that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| but it is not in this particular strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| And it has created – I understand by looking at that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| it's to serve the people of the industrial section there along the railroad tracks where the industrial businesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1921)|
| 0:32:10| The grocery store that is there on the corner would serve those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| but I don't see that they have to be – have an auto repair shop there to comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| So I would like for you to decline the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Mr. Stanley, you have two minutes to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Councilman, this is not a question of whether or not you like the business being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| It's a question of not what's the proper land use, what's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| And I offer – my client has made – has told his tenants that they can't gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| They did gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| They had a party on one occasion, and they partied the way they thought they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| But that's a policing question, not a zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| The police department – that's a matter of control and not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| Are we going to shut down every auto repair place in an I-2 zone in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Well, it's going to create a heck of a problem if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| You're not treating – you will not treat these people with equal and equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| if you tell them because they're Mexicans and the way they did things – and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| Right next door down the street is another facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| They are after these people because they're Mexicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| And that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| It's simply not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| And if you think it differently, why aren't we shutting all these other facilities down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| that are not within the strict requirement of I-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| It's just not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Now, I agree that if they do not obey the law and if they become rowdy and if they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2040)|
| 0:34:09| then they should be – the police should take whatever action is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| But that doesn't have to do with my client and his piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| It's certainly not him that's doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| But you're taking the action against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| One day these tenants will be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| But you will have taken this action, which will restrict his use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| And I just – folks, that just doesn't make sense in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I appreciate Mr. Stanley coming down tonight to represent his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| However, I take offense at his implication that anyone that works for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| or that this council would make a decision based on race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| This is a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Mr. Swanson has provided for us the zoning code for the I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And I would be interested in hearing the district representative, Mr. Becker, as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| In my reading of this code, I don't read anywhere where a use of this nature is permitted in an I-2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| Now, there may be businesses of this type existing in an I-2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| and I can't address why those are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| They could be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Sutherland Avenue and other locations were mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| But specifically in the appeal, Mr. Stanley references Section 16B-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| a retailer service use only where it directly serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| or is auxiliary to the needs of industrial plants or employees thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And in my understanding of that permitted use, an auto repair business, is that what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| an automobile service facility, does not fit within that use in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| So it would be my preference to move to deny, but I'd like to hear from the district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Councillor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| I would actually agree with you, and you summed up, I think, the issue real well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| that the provisions that allow some places in I-2 are designed to serve the industrial plants or the employees directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2166)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, these are, you know, industrial parks that have a diner in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| I think the other significant things on this are that while I-2, to my mind, does clearly exclude this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| I-3 as a zone specifically allows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Mr. Swanson didn't give the I-3 code, but there's a section in I-3 that says automobile that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| And I always wonder about why people would go through the complexity of an appeal to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| and council when a zoning request for a zoning change would much more easily accomplish what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2208)|
| 0:36:58| So I tend to agree with you on moving to deny, but I'll wait to hear from council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| I think that's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Gary Norman is here, and he can speak, I'm sure, on behalf of the enforcement side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| and being sort of the final call in terms of billing officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| But I'm not sure that that's even necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| I tend to concur with what I've heard from my colleagues on council so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| And now I'll come back to Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Vice Mayor Brown, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Attorney Stanley said something that piqued my interest, and I wonder if we have a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| I see Ms. Cash is down front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I don't know if it would be her or Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| But to his statement that in, I think he said January of 2006, an auto shop was approved by the city for this location for another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2266)|
| 0:38:00| Did I hear you say that correctly, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| That's what I meant to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| In January the 10th, 2006, an electrical permit was issued following a conversation in which Mr. Lowe informed Don Garrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2286)|
| 0:38:21| in the electrical inspection that this would be a permitted use in that I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Is this based on some document you've seen, or is this hearsay you've heard from Mr. Garrett or someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| Do you have a document that substantiates that claim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Well, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| May I tell the story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| This is Mr. Hong, who owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| My name is Eugene Hong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I live on 1453 Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| My family owns the property on 408 to 412 in Skip Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| In December, late December 2005, I come to agreement with a gentleman from Honduras to open a glass service shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2335)|
| 0:39:11| But because he needed to get an electrical connection, so he called KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| And KUB said this building has been vacant, no electric service for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| I think it's two years because a previous tenant didn't connect to that particular section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| So the KUB came by and looked at it and said because of that, you need a city inspector to come by to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2369)|
| 0:39:40| If they're okay, we'll connect your electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| So I called the city electrical coding department for inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| Mr. Don Garrett, he's the electrical inspector, came by to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| He said you will need some repair to do, but in order to get that, you'll have to apply for electrical permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2397)|
| 0:40:07| You need an electrical contractor to apply for permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| But we cannot issue you if that building inspector didn't think there will be a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| So he said, why don't you call Mr. Don? Yes, what's his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| Gary Lowe. He's a building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| So I call him. He said, I don't see any problem with such use for auto repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2428)|
| 0:40:39| I'll call Don Garrett for you to tell him this is okay use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| Then I proceed to call my electrical contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| His name is Mr. Puff of Pro Electric, Bobby Puff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| And he applied for electrical permit, proceeded to repair, and the permit number was 060139.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| And the city finalized that permit, the inspection itself, by January of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| So then we had the electrical connected, and we operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| The tenant was there for more than a year with no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| But when one tenant changed to another one because the first tenant wanted to do something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2492)|
| 0:41:44| so he get another gentleman to go over the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| And this new gentleman, the way I understood it, he had a couple birthday parties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| And at night, at the nighttime, he had some people gathering there that he was not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| And that's where the cost and problem was enabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| But he hadn't done that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| So this is to tell you the history of this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| How long has the tenant who's in there now with the auto repair shop, how long has that tenant been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| This new tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| He took over the lease in December 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| And the person who was in before December 2006, I'm over here, did that person operate an auto body shop also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2554)|
| 0:42:45| Yes, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| For how long did that person operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| From January 2006 to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| So from January 2006 to now, there have been two auto body shops in this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Ms. Cash, do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| My name is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I'm the zoning coordinator for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I have researched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| I was provided this information, or this was presented to BZA, and I have researched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| They do have an electrical permit for an electrical upgrade to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| They do not have a building permit for anyone to occupy that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| There are three tenant spaces there, and when we were there, all three spaces were occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| As Mr. Stanley said, Gary Lowe did issue a stop order to the one tenant on the closest to the railroad tracks on July the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2615)|
| 0:43:45| When Gary Norman, Tom Reynolds, and I went in September, I issued an additional stop order to the other auto repair tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| closest to the residential section and to the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| After we came back to the office, there was a question come up about the grocery store or convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| It is not a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| It is a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| And I wrote a letter the very next day to the owner of the property, mailed it to his home address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| and told him that after the conversations we had had, we had re-looked at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| and that the convenience store was a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| I've talked to Gary Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Gary Lowe recalls no such conversation giving them any permission to occupy that building as an auto repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| as a glass facility, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And I just wanted to say that Councilman Becker is correct that when you read the I-3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| it specifically says that that use is permitted in the I-3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| And the title of the I-2 zone is restricted industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Go ahead, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| When did you get the first complaint about this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| July the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| And in essence, what did that complaint, what was the complaint, the substance of the complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Wrong use of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Or crowd or noise or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| It says that the property is zoned O2, and the business is to repair junked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| or wrecked cars for resale and other auto work, including tire sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| None of these functions appear in the ordinance as permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And he would like for us to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Ms. Becker, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Ms. Cash, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Mr. Stanley got up there and obviously spent some time driving down Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| and cited a few other businesses that might be out of compliance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| I've always had a concern about our ability to enforce our zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Do you regularly get to drive around the city with a zoning map and check people's zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| or do you ever get a chance to do that, or do you primarily respond to complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Well, primarily we respond to complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And until a few weeks ago when we got our laptop computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| we would have had to have a set of maps that would have covered up that table to take with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| to verify what property was zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Are you going to be checking out Sutherland Avenue now that some questions have been raised about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Yes, sir, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Mr. Wong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| You were reading from something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Is that something you could pass around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Are you saying you have something in writing from the city that allows what the applicant is trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| No, I don't have the written one, but Mr. Dungarrett, the one told me I need to get it okay from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2808)|
| 0:46:58| from the building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I was just wanting to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I thought you were referencing a document, and I was just wanting to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| I have a document of the electrical permit that Mr. Puff, my electrical contractor, he did after I got it okay from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2824)|
| 0:47:22| Do you have your electrical permit with you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I have the application with the permit number, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Could you pass that up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| And a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| So apparently what the applicant is wanting to do is perhaps not allowed in an I-2 zone, but may be allowed in an I-3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2853)|
| 0:47:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| The I-3 zone allows all of the auto-related businesses as well as the C-3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Depending on the outcome of this tonight, the applicant has the ability to apply to seek for a change to a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| which may or may not be more appropriate depending on the outcome tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| To reiterate, I-2, the use is allowed signs, book bindery, bottling, packaging works, creamery, electrical appliances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| and equipment assembly, electronic equipment engraving, furniture manufacturing, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| Nowhere is there anything listed that involves automotive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| And I think the intent there, as Ms. Cash pointed out, it's restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| With automotive, you have to have a lot of outside use, storage on site, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| And it's just a very different use than these light manufacturing uses that are allowed under I-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| which if you look at it, it's buffering, it's next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Typically, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Sometimes in the city, because the older zoning, we have industrial next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| But we typically try to stay, keep I-3 and I-4 away and buffer it as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| And I think that was the idea here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Quick question, and then I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Mr. Norman or Ms. Cash, we had the discussion about the rural metro station on Murrell Road, an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| Was it the same zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| It was an I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Was that different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| It sounds very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| It was an O zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Oh, it was an O zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Moved and seconded to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Vice Mayor Brown, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| I just wanted to make sure, because some of the comments that have been made, which are very, very good comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| may tend to leave one the impression that this council may be encouraging an application for changing this zoning to I-3 at this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=2995)|
| 0:50:05| You know, I hear a lot of folks talking about how I-3 could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| If it was I-3, that would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| You know, I think we need to be very careful with those kind of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| because if that is what folks seem to be implying or encouraging and we get that application before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| we will find ourselves in a position of having that language quoted to us if we vote for or against the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| So I think I don't know if those folks who made those comments were implying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I may want to make that very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| But if I'm out there, that would be one of the implications I take from this comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| is if it was the right zone, this would be okay for us right now, or if we could get this zone changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| And I am not so sure, and I don't want to be one to say I gave that impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| That is something that I am speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| And so I wanted to put that forth on the record, because I get that feeling that that's kind of being maybe interpreted as being implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| So I hope nothing that I say is implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| And if that is something that comes up, I'll judge it accordingly, because I sense the way this goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| I think this is unfortunate that we're here at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| But I just wanted to kind of comment about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| because knowing Mr. Stanley and the attorney he is, we may very well see a request to change this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| And there's been some comments tonight that we will have to address at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| I was going to ask for Mr. Wong's permit, just in case folks were wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| I didn't see anything on there that indicated from the city that an automobile type of service establishment was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3090)|
| 0:51:39| And I agree with what Vice Mayor Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| There's a time and a place for each zoning, and each has to stand or fall on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| I don't think this is an appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| I just would like to ask to have that introduced in the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| The permit, electrical permit, Mr. Stanley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Whatever document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| That's not a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| That's an application for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| That's not an issued permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| That may be a valid permit number, but that's not an actual permit from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| I was just going to ask, Mr. Stanley, do you have any comments based on what you heard, any follow-up that might be pertinent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| I don't think that's going to change the minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I think you all have made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| We'll live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Joe, we do need that document back from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| No, we need that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| The motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| All those in favor of denial, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| I heard one no, two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| I heard seven ayes and two no's by Brown and Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting and encouraging the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the Town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| to consider a voluntary increase in the amount of sales tax which goes towards support of the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| so as to share more equitably with the citizens of Knoxville and Knox County the financial support for our Knox County educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| Requested by Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Despite some not-so-well-worded headlines, which I have addressed with the appropriate press representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| I see this as a resolution of aspiration versus a resolution of confrontation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| and we all need to aspire to have a better school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I've had the opportunity before this hit the agenda to discuss this with a person I consider my friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| the Vice Mayor of Farragut, Mike Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| We've discussed this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Mike and the other folks that represent the Town of Farragut, the duly elected representatives, are aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3242)|
| 0:54:12| Every elected person on the dais tonight, at one time or another, when they've had school-age children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| if they have children, they've had them in the Knox County public school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| Last year alone, the city sent some $95.5 million to the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| The county sent about $26.8 million, and Farragut sent about $27.0 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| But the city and the county, likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| 2.7 was the Farragut number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| 2.7, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| The city and the county fund at the same percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| I think it's aspirational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| If we're all in the same boat together and we're trying to get to the same place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| if everybody was rowing together at the same pace, the same rate, we can get there faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| and we can get there together a whole lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| Most folks would say, for good or for bad, that Turkey Creek development would not have happened but for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| Farragut has expanded Turkey Creek, and as the city has enjoyed the increased sales tax revenue from Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| respectfully so has the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| In many ways, the city and the county and the town of Farragut are married together with the school system, among other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| This is probably the biggest way in which we might be married to the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| I think we can aspire to have a better school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| I understand Farragut is certainly a much smaller place than either Knoxville or the Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| But, you know, incremental improvements, in my opinion, can happen over time, and we can work to have a better system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| The city has a considerable stake in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| We're very ably represented on the school board, including Mr. Anderson, who's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| The city has a seat at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| One thing that people look at when they're coming to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| they don't look at what the city does, what the county does, what the town of Farragut does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| They look at the area as a whole, and that includes the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Schools are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| The mayor and I, a few weeks ago, discussed this very situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| We're not in the business of schools, but we fund schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| We reap the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| We reap the rewards, and we need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So I'll make that motion, and if Mr. Haslam wants to make any comments on it, invite him to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Let me see some lights first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| So, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| I think this is a great idea with the sponsors' agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Councilman Holquist, so noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I tend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I have some concerns, but I think overall it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| I think that one of the regrettable things that's happened is that a town or city was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| and allowed to be created without a property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And so, you know, that creates a whole different dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| You don't, you know, politically it's easy to do because they're just capturing the same local option sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| that the people would have been paying if they were outside the city, any municipal jurisdiction or boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| And so, you know, it's sort of a win-win politically for those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| the elected officials within the town of Farragut or any other town that might be so constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| But it's, you know, it's regrettable to me that that under state law is allowed to happen, but that's a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| I would point out to my colleagues, just so we'll kind of know where things stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| that that's not unique in cities that do not have their own school systems, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| that they pay in the minimum, which is 50 percent of the local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| Now, the city of Morristown is in a similar situation where Hamlin County schools represent the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| The city has no separate school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| And they pay in at 50 percent on the capture of the local option sales tax back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| So it's not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| But the flip side of it is that, as I think Councilman Frost is pointing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| that if Farragut didn't exist and all those people lived in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| 72 percent of that sales tax would be going to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| And because Farragut is there, less is going to the school system than would be the case otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| So I also talked to Mike Haynes, who is a friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| and talked to him on the phone today about it just to kind of get a little repartee going and get his feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| And I know those folks, Mayor Eddie Ford and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| I think a lot of them are good folks and have enjoyed working with them on a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| But, you know, and I told Mike, I said, you know, I have really mixed emotions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| And I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| But I tend to come down on the side of equity and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| This is a better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Councilman Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Well, I have to support this resolution, although a lot of good friends go to church in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| A lot of good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| My husband has an office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| So we're very close to that situation at this present time in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| But I read a little comment today in the newspaper, and I presume it had to be accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| that indicated that I believe it might have been Vice Mayor Haynes who remarked that, well, you know, we pay county taxes too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3573)|
| 0:59:43| Well, I just want to remind everybody that we city residents pay not only city taxes, but county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| So we are contributing on two fronts to the school system in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| I think there was some indication there of some grants and some other special gifts that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| and that seemed to be the way it was phrased, for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And, you know, I think most of us on this council have generously tried to assist the school systems in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| when we have the opportunity with a few of our discretionary dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| because there aren't enough dollars to go around to provide the system with all of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| that they would like to offer to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| So I support this for that reason and would hope that it would become a topic of serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3625)|
| 1:00:35| and discussion in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| Something else I neglected to mention before, I think in fairness I need to bring up on the side of sort of coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| not supporting the town of Farragut in this, but pointing out something they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Most of the local ops and sales tax that their government runs off of, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| goes into parks and infrastructure, streets, sidewalks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| And they've done a pretty doggone good job of building additional street capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| and especially pedestrian facilities and sidewalks within the parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| So, and that's something that Mike Haynes pointed out to me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| that they do spend money on that to enhance those school area environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| And so it's not so simple as that they don't put any additional money into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| I think there is that side of it, and in fairness, I have to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Let me just comment, and I appreciate the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I mean, bottom line, there's nothing that we can do that's more important than adequately funding our schools, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| Economic development, everything, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And the point has been made, well, they, you know, they don't have a property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| so they don't have anything to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Well, that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| This is Bill Haslam, back of the envelope math, so it might not be exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| but I think I'm close that if we charge 50 percent of our sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| we could drop our property tax rate by almost a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| So that shows you what kind of difference it makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| And we spend over a million dollars a year with Knoxville Police Department and security in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| I might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| This is, again, back of the envelope math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| but I think we spent four or five million dollars in sidewalks around schools just since this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| This particular council has been in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| So, you know, and again, I've had these discussions with Mayor Ford, and they know how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| It's, you know, and the total dollar amount isn't huge, but it is a question of saying we're committed to great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| So that's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| The motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| We're ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute the Turkey Creek Greenway easement with Turkey Creek Land Partners, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| so as to transfer a permanent greenway easement to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| 11C is a resolution expressing city council support for the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| and expressing council's opposition to modifications to the act which would diminish the effectiveness of the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| Requested by council members Frost, Pelo, Brown, Roddy, Becker, and Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Move for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| First, I want to take the opportunity to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| I sent an e-mail to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| I had just come back in town from vacation and did not have the opportunity before this came out to have this sent around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| to see if other folks wanted to sign on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| I apologize, and he was able to do so to get some folks on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| We have a government, in my opinion, that since I've been here has worked pretty well under the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| You know, I realize the TML and their counterparts with a similar county organization have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| will 37 other states use the quorum requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Here's an opportunity for Tennessee to remain a leader in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| You know, like I said, it was quoted, I can have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| If they change the law, I can have a meeting with three folks, go to another meeting with three folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| and so on and so forth until we have a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Then there's no reason to have a meeting like this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| Then there's no reason to have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| and then there's no reason really to have government and elected public officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| You know, I've said it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| I'll say it again and then be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Councilman Huggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| I agree completely with Councilman Frost's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| I think he's dead on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| and I think this body has done well overall with the Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| and all that we've tried to abide by it and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| And I think what we've seen on the county side has been real problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| and I'm really glad that we've had a firm decision on the part of the Chancellor to uphold the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| I would say that I appreciate Representative Bill Dunn's efforts to explore ways to facilitate good communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3918)|
| 1:05:27| between members of elected bodies without allowing any private deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| And I'm not sure if his specific proposal makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| I really haven't had a chance to think it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| But there may be something out there that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| that would allow for public transparent communication amongst members of the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3941)|
| 1:05:51| or other board without in any way obscuring that process from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| And so I'm going to introduce an amendment that I don't think in any way weakens what Councilman Frost has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| in this ordinance, I mean in this resolution, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| but that would encourage the exploration of ways to facilitate good open public communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3968)|
| 1:06:17| So my proposed, I've actually got two amendments that I'm going to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| but I'm going to start with this amendment number one that you have before us, and I'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| It would amend to have section two say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| City Council hereby supports efforts on the part of the state legislature to include innovative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| which would not allow for private deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| but which would allow for effective communication and information exchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| transparent and visible to the public, facilitating a more effective legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| Because I think we want to find ways to make sure that we're all informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| and if we get good information to share that with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| we have to find ways to do that that don't obscure that communication and interchange from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| That's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| And so that's really the intent of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So I hereby move to approve this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Let's see, I'm going to go to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Oh, excuse me, is there a second first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| There's an amendment on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Okay, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Yes, I'd sort of like to hear from Councilman Frost, but I'm going to just sort of say my initial thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| I like your idea, Joe, but I'm not sure if the resolution gets clouded by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| I mean, I sort of like the idea of a clear one that says don't monkey with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| And the nuance that you're getting to I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| I don't know if it's going to, I guess, cloud the resolution, cloud the effect of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| So my tendency would be not to support this, although I like where you're going with the thinking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| I think you're going down an interesting road that needs to be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Councilman Frost, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Well, Councilwoman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| Well, I was prepared to say something else prior to your comments, Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| and I tend to support the thought process that was expressed by Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| because what I initially had started to say was my first experience with the Sunshine Law, as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| There's a little yellow folder, which I carry to this day with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| and I believe someone else was quoted as saying she carries it with her always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| I was asked to serve many, many years ago on the Charter Revision Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| We were handed, day one, a copy of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| It was never unclear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| It was very clear to me that we were expected to work within that and within that framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| and I think it has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| I think it's very clear, and it concerns me to do anything that in any way diminishes the strength of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| or at this point clouds it for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| I see too many people wanting to tamper with it or indicate that it isn't clear to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| And I think it's as clear as can be, and I think it was well written at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| It was well intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I think it served us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| And so it means a great deal to me to see that preserved and really treated with serious respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| So I would tend to agree with Councilman Becker that right at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| when there is so much going on in the dynamics of the government here in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| that it might not be a good time to tamper with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| I certainly appreciate all input, any input from any colleagues have in ever tweaking something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| whether it's I or some other member of council puts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| I do share concerns that, you know, right now we've had meetings being held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| We have lobbyists not just at the gate, they're inside the gate trying to tweak and modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| and, in my opinion, water down the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| I would respectfully submit that these amendments might be more appropriate in separate resolutions at a later meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4219)|
| 1:10:28| whether it's in two weeks' time or four weeks' time or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I mean, one of the proposed amendments talks about something impacting the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| as well as impacting federal legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I'm not making comments about the pros and cons of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| but I'm wanting to make a clear statement from this body as to how we feel the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4244)|
| 1:10:53| and our elected representatives in Nashville should address this situation without getting too far afield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| So, though I appreciate, as always, input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| I would respectfully suggest that the next meeting might be a more appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Councilman Woodhull, and then I'll come to Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I just wanted to respond to my colleague about these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| I think the way this resolution is stated, innovations that are in the boundaries of the Sunshine Law are still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| we can still look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| So I actually feel like this captures the spirit of what you're offering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4286)|
| 1:11:36| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Well, I appreciate the input from all of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| And I'll look back at that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| My initial read of the resolution was that it would essentially lock us in to the present language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| and that's really my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| The Chancellor's decision was very sweeping and broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| and it said that essentially members of the same deliberative body cannot ever communicate with each other in private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| or outside of a meeting that's publicly noticed about anything that they might ever vote on, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| was the way I read that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And that's a pretty strong and broad and sweeping decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| And, again, it's very difficult to draw that line anywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| because as Councilman Frost and others have pointed out, once you pull back at all, then you give wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| You've got to be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| So any innovations have to be very carefully crafted to make sure that they are fully visible and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| That said, given the feedback from my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| and Councilman Frost's suggestion, which I'll take to heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| I will withdraw my motion for now and consider this for a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| and we'll just stick with the basic resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| The second amendment, which deals with asking for equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| suggesting that equity at the state and federal level would be appropriate if it's good for the goose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| it's good for the gander, that there's no reason that one level should have to play by one set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| and the other level's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| I will not introduce that tonight, and we'll consider that for a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| The motion and the second are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Just, Councilman Holquist, that second amendment sort of saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| when that comes up, I'd love to be a co-sponsor on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| I'd love to push that issue a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Councilman Palo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| I was just going to comment that I had been contacted about being a co-sponsor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4417)|
| 1:13:46| Am I just not looking at it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| But I didn't see my name there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| There's a revised one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| There's a revised one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| I'm not looking at the revised copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| I just wanted to make sure because I did want to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| We're back to voting on the original motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I do notice that, I mean, I don't know if Mr. Swanson was able to contact everybody or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| but there's still an opportunity to sign on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| I'm sorry, it's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| We did have someone signed up to speak, and I did not call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| So I would invite you, even though we're at the point, please, if you'd address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| I don't actually live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| My name is John Hootery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I live in Oak Ridge, and I'm a reporter at the Oak Ridger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| I'm also president of the East Tennessee Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| We have about 65 members in East Tennessee, including in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| and are part of a national organization that includes close to 10,000 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| I'm here tonight to urge you to support Councilman Frost's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| Like Councilman Frost, I oppose changing the definition of a public meeting from a two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| or more standard to a quorum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I believe the current definition is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| The proposed change to a quorum standard would reduce the media's ability to report on government affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| Just as importantly, it would reduce the public's ability to participate in the deliberation of public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| Local officials I've talked to in Oak Ridge and Anderson County tell me they also oppose this proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| These officials include State Senator Randy McNally, Oak Ridge Mayor Tom Behan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| and Anderson County Commission Chairman Myron Iwanski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| The lawsuit against the Knox County Commission, I believe, showed why strong open government laws are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| It did not show a need for a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Again, I urge you to support Councilman Frost's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Councilman Bailey, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Yeah, well, I want to make sure my name is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| We want to make sure that's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I want to have my name added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4560)|

| 1:16:51| There's going to be a location change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| We were previously meeting in the ballroom of the Civic Auditorium Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| The acoustics in it are, quite frankly, awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| We are now going to move to the Cal Johnson Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Free parking, easy in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| You can see it from where we previously met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| But Monday, November 26th, 730 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4632)|

| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I hope Councilman Frost realized by his comment that, come budget time next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| we will be getting an email from Nick DellaVolpe about the acoustics in the auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4649)|

| 1:17:39| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with the Professional Transit Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| LTD, for management of Knoxville Area Transit for a period of three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| with the option to extend the agreement for two additional one-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Yeah, I don't necessarily have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| I just want to raise an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| I read through this contract and was struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| This is one of those sort of neither fish nor fowl issues where, clearly, these aren't, isn't a city service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| So a lot of limits on our contracting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I had actually a good discussion with Director Anderson, Senior Director Anderson, and got my questions cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| But I wanted to kind of raise that this is not a classic we're contracting things out contract with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| And that's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4710)|

| 1:18:33| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to file a grant application with the Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| United States of America, and State of Tennessee to provide funding to Knoxville Area Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| for a 5309 discretionary capital grant for fiscal year 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| which will provide funding for the Downtown Transit Center project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| And if such application is approved, authorize the Mayor to execute any and all documents to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| 12A is an ordinance to annex certain territory adjoining the bounds of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| an area generally being described as attractive land southeast of Callahan Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| and approximately 400 feet northeast of the intersection of Old Callahan Drive and Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| which property is to be incorporated into the limits of the City of Knoxville and to revise the boundary of Ward 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Councilmember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| I actually have a concern on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| This is on Callahan at Old Callahan, which always gets my blood boiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| We've got a zoning later, which will get my blood boiling again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| I wanted to sort of just raise, I think this is probably a better thing to have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| We just did a resolution creating the Tazewell Pike Beverly Row Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| which frankly is an issue we have to deal with because there's development happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| and there's development that we didn't plan for well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| And I'm real concerned about this Callahan, Old Callahan Road, that we are creating a series of problems here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4793)|
| 1:20:02| Callahan was, in the Callahan Road corridor study, it was actually recommended that it be light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| and it was done to limit the number of driveways that are accessing Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| Callahan should look a whole lot like Gallagher View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| It's a road to move traffic, and we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| And while we're creating a lot of development on Callahan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| we're also creating a whole lot of development on Old Callahan, which is a winding narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| And I don't think necessarily in the time frame of this council, but in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| we're going to have to be dealing with the problems we're creating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| And this is a little easier to understand because we've actually got a land ownership problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| that encourages the creation of a lot of driveways along Callahan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| because we've got all these individual long, narrow parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| And I don't know what's going to happen with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| but I'll almost guarantee there's going to be another driveway created on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| which is defeating the whole purpose of a major plan that this council, this municipality developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| So that's my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Councilwoman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| I would just respond that this particular ordinance has to do with annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| So my support of this annexation does not indicate my disagreement with your previous comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Councilwoman Palo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Well, and it's just interesting you mentioned Gullahar View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| because that is an area which was annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| which did bring about some change, needed change in how that area was looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| And I think that was looked at through a sector plan analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| and the involvement of the neighborhoods and so on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| And it does call for that kind of scrutiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| and I think it does call for those neighborhoods and those areas to become particularly interested in the sector plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4908)|
| 1:21:58| Councilwoman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=4918)|

| 1:23:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| 12E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations, Articles 2, 4, and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| to increase the maximum size of residential accessory buildings and structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| and to require use on review for those exceeding 1,100 square feet in building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| We do have someone sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| My name is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| We are opposed to MPC's proposal for changes in the allowed accessory building size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| MPC's recommendation is that the right of use be increased from 750 square feet to 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5044)|
| 1:24:16| This is a 47 percent increase in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| This means that someone will only need to have a building permit to build an accessory building up to 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5061)|
| 1:24:31| There's no other public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| A major concern is that this will give people greater opportunity to run businesses out of their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| have large garage apartments, or even a second residence on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| Another concern is that in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| people do not build accessory buildings to the same standards that they do their primary residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5091)|
| 1:25:00| The proposed ordinance change has merit in that it takes the request to increase accessory building size from VZA to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5100)|
| 1:25:14| Also, the proposed ordinance uses the use-on-review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| to evaluate requests for accessory building size greater than the right of use size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| A more public and well-publicized process then is used by VZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| The right of use of an accessory building is currently 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5133)|
| 1:25:41| The proposed change would allow up to 1,100 square feet as a right of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| We would like to see a compromise of 900 square feet, an earlier proposal from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| that this be set as the maximum right of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| The ordinance will still allow both the residence and the accessory building to not exceed 30 percent of the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5161)|
| 1:26:11| Another point that I would like to make is that 1,100 square feet would have a significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5171)|
| 1:26:19| probably negative effect and impact on established neighborhoods with medium-sized homes on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Councilman Becker, or Councilman Frost, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| There might be some other folks here on this issue tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| but approximately five years and ten months ago, this matter came to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| I remember it was one of the very first meetings that I was participating in as a member of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| and it was unanimously defeated then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| In the past, before anyone here was elected, there were some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| and particularly out in the fourth district where people were building or trying to build or had been caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| having very large structures which they were running businesses out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| I believe, actually, one was doing a baseball academy out of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| So I see this as a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| From reading the minutes from MPC, it appears that the MPC staff recommendation was the threshold at 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5245)|
| 1:27:38| Public review is not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| I don't, you know, I can certainly and willingly listen to comments of colleagues on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5261)|
| 1:27:51| but I support it as is, and I believe in a, you know, they've averaged maybe one a month with these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5271)|
| 1:28:00| and they're appropriate in many circumstances, and likewise they're inappropriate in other circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| I guess I, it's interesting to hear Mr. Frost say he wants to leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| I'm tending to like some of the changes you're making about what goes beyond just the accessory size, the straight square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| I think there's some good thinking in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| I'm actually real concerned about the large scale, the idea of a three-car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| the idea of space for two cars and a boat and a workshop sort of by right in many of the neighborhoods in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| where I don't think it fits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| I think that's a huge scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Now, we've got provision to say it can't be larger than house, but I think in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| and in much of this city that would allow people to build garages as big as their house on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| and I don't think we want to encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| My tendency would be to support the compromise, Mr. Frost, and go for 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| And I guess I wanted to ask Mr. Swanson a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| MPC talked about the 900 and the 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| With all the different changes in this, we can do an amendment just to change all of the 1100s to 900 or 750 if we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5351)|
| 1:29:22| As long as you stay under that parameter, I think you'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| If you were to go over it, I think you would need to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| But as long as you stay under, I think you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| Well, I've received some very interesting e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Comments have been by e-mail regarding this issue, and I see several people out here in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| who have actually been in contact with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| I've given this a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| You know, evidently, and Councilman Frost, I don't know if you want to comment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| since you've taken a position of leaving it as it is, but maybe I should ask Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| It seems to me that there have been a large number of requests before the building, the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| And is that one of the reasons that this became, that this was looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| and that there was some concern about the number of requests that were going before BCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| In fact, MPC was asked by the Board of Zoning Appeals to look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| because of the number of cases that they had received over the past year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| And they had suggested raising the cap from 750 to 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5435)|
| 1:30:44| Well, can I, I'm just going to comment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| it concerns me that there have been so many requests before the BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| There's one in particular that was turned down by the BCA that I thought was just inappropriately turned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| with absolutely no understanding of the overall situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| And it was one in which the size of the structure would have been of no issue whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| because this was basically in a state on which this structure was to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| So I felt that that was a huge inequity and that never got appealed to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| but it's one that, you know, kind of sticks in my mind of it concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| However, I have to agree with Councilman Backer that there are just many, many areas of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| where this size does not fit into the overall neighborhood's appearance or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5492)|
| 1:31:46| I can see cases where actually the additional structure would be larger than the original structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| This really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| I think this needs a little more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I mean, it's kind of in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| I haven't been involved in it in any hands-on manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| But I've had some really good suggestions that have come to me from some citizens who are very interested in the whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5521)|
| 1:32:09| So I don't know where we go, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I'm not so sure I want to say just forget it because I think we do have something that needs further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| But in the form that it is, I'm not prepared to really support it on a whole scale basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| I served on BZA several years before I came on council and am familiar with one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| or more than one, actually, but certainly one that comes to mind in the Fountain City Inskip area on Fair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| I guess technically it's Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| That was a structure that I think ended up being larger than the primary structure, but it was pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| I think in the final analysis they had to tear it down or modify it significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| But anyway, it's something that I'm reluctant to change unless I feel like the safeguards are there that are at least as strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5578)|
| 1:33:09| in terms of community review and input and all that as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And so I'm a little reluctant to tinker with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| I guess I have a question for Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| You all are suggesting a compromise of 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Do you like the idea of, other than the square footage, do you like how this changes things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| some of the move from a BZA to an MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| You're supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Actually, we really wouldn't have a problem with it staying 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| I think that we just thought a compromise might be accepted more than just we don't want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5628)|
| 1:33:57| But to jump to 1,100 square feet we feel is just really out of bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| I'm going to go ahead and offer an amendment to change 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| Right now there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| Oh, is there not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Right now there's no one else on the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Would anyone like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Second from Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| I'd like to make an amendment to change the square footage number to 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| That's the same as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| But it changes the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| The process changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| This does a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| It changes the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| It also changes the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| And, Mr. Donaldson, you can explain this a little more than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| So please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| I thought you were the smartest guy in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| That's what he tells himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Go ahead, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| The current code places an absolute cap on the size of an accessory building at 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| As it's proposed, the cap on an accessory building would be that it has to be less than the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5718)|
| 1:35:27| And it establishes a difference between small accessory buildings and large accessory buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| with small being a use by right and large being a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| And as written in the amendment that you have, that threshold between small and large is at 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| We also looked at 750 square feet and 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| But we clearly are creating a process where small buildings are a use by right as long as they're smaller than the primary building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5754)|
| 1:36:03| and the larger ones come through the MPC as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| So we get site plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| and we provided some guidelines for the commission to look at compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5768)|
| 1:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Just by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| I guess, I mean, I see this change moving to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and some actual guidelines established on how other decisions get made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| I don't necessarily disagree with keeping it as is, but a lot of thought has been going into all these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| I can disagree with the square footage, but I think some of the other stuff makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| So that would be my proposal to adopt the new language but change the square footage to keep it where it's at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Right now that motion doesn't have a second, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| It does have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| No, he seconded the first approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Did the amendment, anybody second the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Okay, right now there's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| I'm not going to second it until I get a question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| Somebody, Mr. Johnson, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Talk to me about the usual size of a three-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| A typical three-car garage would have a footprint of 24 feet of depth and 36 feet of width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| That's 864 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Yeah, so that's why I was kind of looking at some of the e-mails I'd received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| which it seemed to me like it was around 850 square feet that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5859)|
| 1:37:48| Councilman Bagger, that had been recommended for the size of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| And so that was the reason I didn't second your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| because I'm thinking that that doesn't solve the issue of this always having to come up for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| If it is just a three-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Is there so far there's no second to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| So the original motion is what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| You're declaring my amendment has died?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Unless somebody wants to speak in the next five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| Failed for a lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| I died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Now we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| The motion is on the floor as the original motion as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| Can I withdraw that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| I think you can do that if the second wants to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| And the second was Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| If he wants to withdraw his motion, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| And I'll be glad to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| You going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Then I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| There's Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Good golly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| And there's a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Now is there discussion back to its original motion as presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| Well, you know, I don't agree with the 1,100 square feet issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| I mean, I was, you know, I think, you know, if, you know, I support it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| I'm certainly willing to consider the bump to 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| You know, I'm hoping someone will make that motion because I'm still kind of have my toe in the water of as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5969)|
| 1:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I support the ordinance as it is, not tinkering with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| So I plan to vote to not vote to deny, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| I'm not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| I'm not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| You're going to vote for the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Wherever we are, I'm voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Leave well enough alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| There's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| No, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| No, there's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| The motion right now is as presented in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| That's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| I plan to not to vote against the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| You're going to leave it the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| I'm going to muddy the waters by making a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| It feels like there's still some confusion about what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Why would you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| And I also think it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| What is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| The fact that Fountain City Town Hall came up offering a compromise, thinking they had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| I mean, I think the politics are considerably different than what I thought it would be even an hour ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| So I'm going to suggest having two more weeks for us to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| It's not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| I'll second that because I think there's some issues here about changing process as well as changing size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| And I'm not clear yet in my mind whether changing process is going to be helpful or hurtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| I like the size at 750 where it is, but I understand the point that this ordinance addresses two separate things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| one's size and one's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| And I'd like more time to learn from folks that have been involved with this whether the process needs tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| So I'll second the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| And I'll just comment that I was just about to make a motion to change the size to either 850 or 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| I don't care which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| But I do think that the issue of the concern of so many of these issues going before BCA worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| I attend those meetings rather regularly, and I really feel it needs to be a different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6091)|
| 1:41:38| So I was looking to change the process and have a size which would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| without having to go before BCA for a typical size three-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| And that was what was in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Councilman Huggins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Well, I'm going to support the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| I was ready to vote against this amendment to the ordinance, but I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| And I think there are a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| We were talking earlier on another issue about looking at best practices and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| And there are things that we're going to have to continue to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| and they're going to come up more and more over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Some cities are focusing on secondary structures as additional housing in order to add density in their communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6137)|
| 1:42:26| and they're moving on a policy basis in that direction and addressing it in their zoning and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| That's a can of worms to some degree because of parking and cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| And so I'm not suggesting we go there yet, that we're ready to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| but I do think it's appropriate to at least back up on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| and take a very close and thoughtful look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Let me say that I am not insensitive to the concerns about 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6169)|
| 1:42:56| I do just want to state for the record that since I've been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| and since Mr. Donaldson has been in MPC even before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| I think they work very hard at addressing issues like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| and are very, very sensitive to the character of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| and sensitive to the same kind of issues we're struggling with here with regards to the size of the accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| So I tend to, at this juncture, and I don't do it all the time because I don't give a rubber stamp to anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| but I tend to, at this juncture, want to give a lot of credence to the experts here at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| because they have done an awful lot of good things as it relates to zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| and protecting neighborhoods as well as allowing businesses to flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| We've been getting a good balance of things coming out of that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| So I tend to want to lean on their expertise in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| And while a postponement may be well and good for us to continue to debate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| I think that history has shown us that MPC takes the issue of preserving the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| and integrity of neighborhoods very seriously while also balancing the interests of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| And I would assume, and from looking at these documents, that that was also done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6248)|

| 1:44:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6265)|

| 1:44:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| In the two weeks, what do we hope to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| More e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| I think that we want to have some clarity on this proposed changes, changes of square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| and then changes of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| And I think, from my perspective, most of my thinking has been about the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| I want to spend those two weeks thinking about what the process is, which I've heard some good things about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| but I want to understand better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| We don't anticipate any activity going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| We just anticipate all of us kind of thinking through this a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| That would be my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6307)|

| 1:50:58| This is a piece of property that was caught in the transition when Gallaher View Road was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| The community has worked with the developer and the owner of the property for over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| and we think this is an appropriate use to give us a good border transition to put appropriate development on Gallaher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| and at the same time protect the single-family lots that are behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Community, is it in agreement with the owner who is here sitting with me, actually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| And we're all in agreement, and I'll pass the rest of my time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6685)|

| 1:51:30| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| Mr. Fuehrer, don't leave the mic yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| Joe, just a question and clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| Some of this is floodway or F1 flood protection district, so the floodway itself would be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6700)|
| 1:51:48| but, you know, anytime we amend a way or change, rezone from open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| I have some vague recollection of zoning this open space a while back initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| and I just want to make sure we're clear on why it was open space initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| and why we're transitioning from open space now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| Mark may be able to answer that better, but basically this was land that was trapped by the widening of Gallaher View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| In realignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| There was a large portion of Moss Hill Road in the process, and this property was then sort of hit in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| Only recently have they changed the floodway plane, which made this land a little more developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| And that was the open space really went with the floodway designation, I guess, initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| but it's not critical at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Ms. Pito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Well, it was just a very, very challenged area due to the new route of the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| We spoke of that road earlier and how the development had changed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| and Mr. Gibson has looked for quite some time for a way in which he could satisfactorily develop his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| and we are just so pleased that something has been worked out that is totally to his satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| and the neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| So we're grateful to him for being so patient and working with us so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| It's a good thing for everybody around, and I want to thank you for working with us, Mr. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=6787)|

| 1:57:02| That's Old Callaghan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| I just, again, I think we're making mistakes with Old Callaghan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| I think we're allowing sprawl to happen by development going up an old road like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7026)|

| 1:57:44| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Well, I'm going to try something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| I'm actually going to say we've taken a position as a council not liking C4 as a zone, much preferring C6, which allows a lot of the same developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| I'm going to offer an amendment that we change this to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| What's the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7080)|

| 1:58:09| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| I'm going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| I saw Mr. Dawson do his hand up as if he had something he wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| However, with all due respect to my good friend, the councilman from the Fabulous Fifth, I don't think we have an official position of not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7097)|
| 1:58:27| I'm sorry, the Fantastic Fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| I don't think we have an official position against C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| We just had some discussion in votes recently, so I don't want anyone to think that that's a council official position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| Yes, I was going to say I don't think we should necessarily tinker with the motion if the applicant's not here to give them a fair opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7121)|
| 1:58:51| So if we're moving towards tinkering with it, I think we should postpone to give them an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| Was that a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Is the motion to amend, does it have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| I'll move to postpone two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| The motion is seconded to postpone for two weeks so they can talk to the applicant, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| as a purpose to see if they agree with C6 instead of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| Further discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| I'm willing to support the motion to postpone, although keeping in mind that this is first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| so either way the applicant would have a chance to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| All those in favor of postponing two weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7174)|

| 1:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| I have six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| The motion is to postpone for two weeks or the decision is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| I don't have an official policy yet against C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Do I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7197)|

| 2:01:07| I had some interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| If you could come down real quick to the podium just to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Well, it's not actually going to be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| This is actually a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| I got to go down and drive around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| It's developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| This is actually turning into a really interesting section of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| some of the student housing moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Happened to be talking to Mr. Donaldson about this when a fellow named Mike Carberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| who is sort of our ñ I always think of him as our great planning thinker, was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| And we started looking at your plan, the actual, and got thinking about some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| This is like an A- plan and ways to make it an A+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| And I got a call from Mike today, and this is just to pass on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| It might be worth the conversation with him that he thought there's some possibilities of us waiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| some of the parking requirements if you move up to the street and sort of fit in a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| So I was just going to suggest that you give Mike Carberry a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| I know Mark will have his phone number in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7319)|

| 2:02:06| And, again, I like this, and I think it's a great idea, and I'm glad you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7326)|

| 2:02:33| And I'd certainly be willing to work with the applicant and Mr. Carberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| and others and MPC to see what we can do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071106?start=7358)|
