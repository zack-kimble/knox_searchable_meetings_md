| 0:03:29| And understand, still married, so far, so good, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=209)|

| 0:03:39| You turned red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| We also want to remind, so I hope everybody had a great holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Appreciate everybody who's here tonight or maybe watching us on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| We do want to remind everyone that the holidays are not quite over yet on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| The Holidays on Ice skating rink will stay open until January 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| so we've extended that I think two more weeks from what we normally would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| And so there's plenty of time to get down there and to skate and have some fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| We have a good event coming up tomorrow, a real landmark in the ongoing Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| We have completed Phase 1 of that project, which is basically the stretch of road from Alcoa Highway to 22nd Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| Phase 2 has already started, and that'll carry the work all the way east to 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| But tomorrow we're going to take the time to celebrate Phase 1 completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| So there will be a ribbon cutting at 4 o'clock tomorrow on the grassy area at the entrance to University Commons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| just north of the Three Rivers Rambler train depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| So this is a great chance to recognize the great work of our Office of Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| in keeping that project on track along with our contractors and engineering department, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| all the different partners, and of course the merchants who have been so supportive and understanding as that work has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| So please come out and join us tomorrow at 4 o'clock at University Commons, just near the train depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| Also, another important meeting will have to do with the auditorium and coliseum to discuss the feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| that was recently completed and we've put out there to everybody, and it's on our city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| That meeting will be on Thursday, January 14th at 6 p.m. at the Civic Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| This, as I said, the study is on our city's website at knoxvilletn.gov slash kcacstudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=329)|
| 0:05:41| It's very detailed and it lays out several issues and options at those city facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| We really do want to hear thoughts and opinions from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| They're not easy solutions and they're not cheap either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Some are cheaper than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Some are more expensive than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| But it's something that will be given a lot of consideration by this administration and by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| So please take a look at the study that's online and come on out to the meeting next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| If you can't make it to the meeting, you can e-mail any thoughts or questions about the study to this e-mail address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| comments at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| You can give us your comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Next week we'll begin the annual series of events to celebrate the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| That includes the educational symposium and awards luncheon next Thursday, January 14th at the Knoxville Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| Actually, I think the day before we have the interfaith service, which is not on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| but I'm going to give you the website so you can check out all the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| But there's an interfaith service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| There's an educational symposium and awards luncheon, which is on Thursday the 14th at the Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| There's a community forum at 630 on Friday the 15th at the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| A youth symposium is on Saturday the 16th at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| And the annual MLK parade, which I know a lot of you all march, we all march in that, on Monday, January 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| The parade will step off at 10 a.m. from the YWCA Phyllis Wheatley Center on Cruz Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| Hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| And that's followed by the MLK Memorial Tribute Service at the Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| at the end of the march in Burlington there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And then that evening at the Tennessee Theater is the Night of the Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| So it's always a lot of activities around MLK holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| and hopefully the public will come out and attend those with us and honor Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| And just a reminder, city offices will be closed on the 18th, Monday the 18th, in observance of the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| Also, I want to let you all know that we have set the time and date for this year's annual budget retreat with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| It's where the administration and council sits down, and we give them a kind of midyear review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| on how our budget projections, our revenues, and expenses are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| and then start talking about the process, the budgeting process that gets announced in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| the new budget, our proposal, and then council votes on that, and it starts July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| So this is our annual budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| It will be on Friday, February 5th at 830 in the morning in room 200 ABC of the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=512)|
| 0:08:42| That's where we had it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| And again, Friday the 5th at 830 a.m. It is open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| And finally, I want to acknowledge the service and the untimely death of someone who gave a lot to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| It seems like we've had too many of these announcements over this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| But Andy Ray passed away recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| She was a member of the city's Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| and she was a leader of the Old North Knoxville Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| She passed away last month after a brief illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Before moving to Old North, Andy was one of the pioneers in the revitalization of Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and many of us fondly remember her dress shop, Vagabondia, for real women, real women sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| And wherever she went, you all remember, she always had her magnificent array of hats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and she was just an energizing presence wherever she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| So we will miss her, and a lot of us will personally miss her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| The city will miss her, and our thoughts and prayers are with her husband and the rest of her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| So that is the conclusion of my report. Any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| No? Okay, we'll move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=593)|

| 0:11:04| Mayor, maybe this is a dumb question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| but can you explain why we have a separate development board for the cinema?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I didn't know the reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Yes, Dr. Lyons will explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Yes, when we set up the financing structure for the cinema,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| it required a different governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=676)|

| 0:13:09| Yeah, just a quick question to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| When this started out, it was going to be a bunch of broader terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| that covered any craft or industrial craft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and we carved out the bakeries so that it could be specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| and have sort of standards we could understand and districts that it made sense in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| Are you still working on the rest of the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| or was that really just something that was overbroad to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| and we narrowed it down to the request that initiated it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| It's addressing the issue that was raised at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| For a bakery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| And so we don't have another study to look at any other craft industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Not at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=832)|

| 0:15:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Councilman Dallaby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Yeah, Jim Hagerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| So, Jim, tell us a little bit about the portion that is the road diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| You have at least one segment of that road that was two lanes in each direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| in order to, I guess, make it a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| You're sort of borrowing some of that turf for the bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| and pedestrian walk areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And my question really relates to do you think that's going to affect traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| and traffic flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I mean, it was designed kind of maybe broader than it needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| but handles traffic really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| What do you understand will happen as we narrow that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| This section, you're, I'm sure, aware that north of Summit Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| it's four-lane cross-section with bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| South of Summit Hill it's still four-lane cross-section but no bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Traffic is not all that heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| The traffic volume is not all that heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Preliminary traffic flow modeling shows that it doesn't really have much impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| to take out that additional lane so that you compress it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| to a three-lane cross-section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| It creates continuity for the bike lanes all the way through that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Right now, if you're going south on the Hall of Fame bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| you get to Summit Hill and you're crunched into the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Yeah, you've got to elbow your way through the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| But it's actually not that tough because there just isn't that much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Which is a good thing, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Yeah, so that's why it's possible to make it into a three-lane cross-section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| without really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Is that reversible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I mean, what's the, is it more striping than anything or what is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| A lot of it is striping for just the bike lane part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| It's mostly striping but there's also some pedestrian improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| sidewalk improvements, and in particular the slip lane on the eastbound church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1030)|
| 0:17:22| As you approach Hall of Fame, you can make that right turn without stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| But that whole situation is pretty hostile for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| It makes it a lot more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So part of the biggest piece of actual construction in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| is taking out that slip lane and extending sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Right, and that will better connect that area to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| There's a lot of housing up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1069)|

| 0:19:42| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Yeah, it would be, I think, a waste of an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| to have Jeffrey Nash sit in the audience and not speak to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and we get to enjoy his British accent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| He was willing to not speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I wanted to hear a little bit more about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1195)|

| 0:20:00| Would you just tell us about what you're going to try to get done there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| I take it you're sort of pretty close to the muse and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| but if you'll come to the microphone and educate us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| this is an interesting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I'm sure I couldn't educate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1213)|

| 0:20:22| The Muse 2 is an extension of the Muse 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| which I hope most of you have had an opportunity of driving past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and I feel really proud of how that has manifested itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| and how so many buyers have taken the plunge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and actually bought from that particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| It's really encouraged us to try and do something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| with that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Magnolia is something that is on the plan for being totally revitalised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| There's a lot of plans for going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| We're planning on doing an 18-apartment development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| with four new commercial spaces on the Magnolia corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| It's very challenging, just as the Muse 1 was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| It was very challenging, but we're very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| From my own personal perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| it's the first time that I will be doing a new build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I've never done a new build in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| You're tearing down the old and putting in the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Absolutely, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I've never done a new build in London or in Knoxville, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| I've only ever redeveloped old buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| and I'm pretty sad to take down what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| For those of you who have seen what is there—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| That's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I'm glad you said that, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| So I'm really excited about the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| and hope that we can get it together as quick as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| We hope to start in March with the demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| and hope to finish the whole development by probably June, July of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1332)|

| 0:22:16| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I just want to ask Don and Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| In April, we approved a pilot for this, and now we're approving a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| So explain how that went down and what happens to that pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| No part of that's been used at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Give me an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| I'm Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| There was a pilot that was authorized in April, I believe, of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| However, the developer feels like the TIF is more substantial for what he needs to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| the property expansion and also the utility upgrades as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| So the TIF would probably support the project much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| If the TIF is authorized tonight, the pilot goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1383)|

| 0:23:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1385)|

| 0:25:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| We have a Councilman Dallivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Yeah, I don't see Mr. Green, but I guess Mr. Kelly can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| This looks like a pretty upscale looking building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Could you tell us a little bit about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I guess we're just approving the zoning at this point, but at least the artist rendering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| shows a pretty substantial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Oh, let's read the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| The redevelopment will be substantial at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| At this point, what you're dealing with is rezoning the property from C3 to C2, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| will allow greater use of the land, and less parking requirements, and all the other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1551)|
| 0:26:00| around is zoned C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Will you have a plans review session coming up behind this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| The D1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| The D1 will bring them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Motion is ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| 12E is an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side of Boyd's Bridge Pike, west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| of Delrose Drive, from 03 and R1 District to 01 and R1A District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| Sertoma Center applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| If it passes, I wanted to also make a motion that it be placed on emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| and if anyone has any questions about it, I'll see Senator Massey, who is here, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Thanks for being here, Senator Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| We'll see you tomorrow morning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| So I think what we need to do is make an amendment to pass this on emergency, if that's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| And we'll vote on that first, and then we'll vote on it as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| So the motion is to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| And then back to the original motion as amended, and we already had a motion and second on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I wonder, since we have Senator Massey here, and she does such good work for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| if she'd come up and tell us about this track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Sertoma had a smaller development planned at one point on Sunset and Brooks Road, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| that met some opposition, but they have worked very hard to come up with a project and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| plan that looks like it's made everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| So if you'd tell us a little bit about it, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I'm Becky Massey, and I'm the Executive Director of Sertoma Center, and we're located at 1400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| And basically, we are looking for property to build a duplex on that is handicap accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| for the folks that Sertoma serves that have intellectual disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And as they age, their needs have been changing, and the duplex model that is handicap accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| really does help meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| And it's hard to go out in the community to find homes that are truly accessible for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| So that is what we're looking at building at this project, and we're excited to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| So we have a motion and a second to approve this as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Okay, that's the end of our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Well, we do have public forum, and Ms. Vivian Scheib is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| So you don't have to wait as long as you have had different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| This is a shorter meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| As you know, state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Vivian Scheib, 109 South Gallaher, View Road, Knoxville, 379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I came to talk to you tonight because a lot's going on in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| I didn't hear a word about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| A lot of faith and work is being put forth in this community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| The police are putting forth faith and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| The gangs have put down their colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| They're putting forth faith and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| The churches are coming from behind their pulpits and coming out into the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| The citizens of Knoxville are stepping out and going in and praying in the schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| thinking about the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Yet I'm hearing a voice of negativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| It's been said that we can't rid our community of the violence that we're seeing, that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| been going on for 20 or more years, and they don't think it's going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| It's not going away because we are not treating the root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| But this time I can see it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| This time we're going to the youth right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| So there is no uprising 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| But to do this, there must also be a priority of pouring into the community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1807)|
| 0:30:15| This is a right now time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| For an example, right now you're preparing to put up a monument or a statue on Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| that you're going to spend $600,000 for between the plans and the actual building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| But what you haven't thought about is where that monument stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| It stands with its back to the gateway to East Knoxville where the youth that need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1834)|
| 0:30:42| are being ignored as they say, help us, train us, give us help, listen to us, see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| We're doing great things in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| We're recognized nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| But the root is what's being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So what I'm telling you right now when you go to your budget meetings is to pour into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Right now make some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Right now besides the 202 funds, let's get some of that big money into the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| Let's give those kids some work, the kids, the 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Not just their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Those kids need work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Everybody needs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| And if you'll do that, then in 20 years you will have broken this cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| and you won't hear that statement, well, I don't think it's going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| because you will have handled it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| If you don't pull the root up, you haven't done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Every meeting you all start with an invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| You are acknowledging a power higher than you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| That's what we're doing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| We're acknowledging we need some help, and it's not on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| What I'm asking you is God has given you all our talents, our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| I'm asking you to use them now, to use them for our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| If you will just do this right now, if you'll just do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Then, because we're getting their attention, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| That's what we're going out here for, these parents, these teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| these faith organizations, the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| We're getting their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| And when they turn their attention from the gangs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| and when they turn their attention from robbing and stealing and hurting each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| when they turn their attention, what are we going to have already in place to keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Okay, counsel, there's no further business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160105?start=1954)|
