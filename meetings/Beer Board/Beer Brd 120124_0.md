| 0:00:57| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Sir, Mr. Cameron, if you'll come back, Councilman De La Vope has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| Just curious, are you changing the name of the company or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| Is that why you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| No, this is a change in ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| My ex-business partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| So it's kind of realigning, but you've been in that location for a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=77)|

| 0:01:42| Would you please save your paperwork, and at the end, we'll give it to Ms. Martin, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| we'll save some trees next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| We're in the tree-saving mode tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| The next case is the Knoxville Opera Company, two events, and I believe this will be Don| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| Townsend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Don Townsend, 5200 Mountain Crest Drive, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Ms. Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| No applicable records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| All's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Would you like to tell us about, you have two events, and so we probably all know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| one but not so much about the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| The first event is a opera party that is going to be held at the Tennessee Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| on the set of Romeo and Juliet on the 11th of February, and it is basically a lecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=143)|
| 0:02:32| and dinner which will be based around Shakespeare because the Knoxville Opera is sponsoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| a Shakespeare project for the spring, and we're doing Romeo and Juliet at the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| Theater and also Verdi's Othello, and so this is all in connection with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| That's the first event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| The second event is the 11th annual Rossini Festival which takes place on April the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| and it's the annual street fair in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Mr. Counselor Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| I just wanted to disclose I have an immediate family member on the board of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Opera Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| There's no pecuniary interest, but I just wanted to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Well, this gives me an opportunity to introduce our new attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Mr. Frost, do you want to render an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| He disclosed that he has no pecuniary interest, so he's given adequate notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Now, do I have a motion to approve this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| The next is R. S. Littman Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| This should be Mr. Littman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| No, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| I'm Henry Hildebrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I'm an attorney from Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| I represent the R. S. Littman Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| With me is Richard Thibus, who is an officer of the company as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Could you give us your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| My address is 150 4th Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee, 37219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Mr. Littman and Mr. Thibus have not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=251)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector and fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I know that I talked with someone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| And that that processing will take place soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| We had assumed when we first made the application, because Mr. Thibus and Mr. Littman had had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| a prior beer permit here, a wholesale beer permit, that the information was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| We were advised by the police department it was not accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| So we agreed to provide the information necessary for them to complete the criminal or the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| For purposes of the fire inspection, that has been held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| For purposes of the building inspection, there's one minor electrical thing that has to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| But we would ask the board to approve the issuance of the license subject to the completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| of that inspection and the background check for these two officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| So I'm going to move that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| If I could ask Lieutenant Hunter, what is the processing that you do in connection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| a party that's already had a prior license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Is it any different or do you go through the whole check to get to current time frame information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| We conduct another background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| But if we've already got their fingerprints on file, we'll pull and photocopy it and stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| it in the new file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I believe I was advised that the fingerprints were from 2002 and currently they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| archived so we don't have access to them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| And we were advised of that and we're going to provide the new fingerprint cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| And I have one other question if Dottie or someone can tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Do they have to go through the task training and all those other steps at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| I would defer to the beer board on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Not since they're a distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| I know you all are a distributor and the way I understand your business works, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| lines are very exclusive to areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| So what are you all going to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Tennessee is a very, it may be hard to believe, but Tennessee has a lot of small brands and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| small interests that are now finding that the larger distributors can't handle the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| small, the micro breweries and these customized breweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| The Littman Company is anxious to get involved in that and make a broader distribution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| make these brands available in places where they would otherwise not be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| That's why, and that's their success that they've had in Nashville, they've reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| out and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| They're going to do the same thing here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| They do not distribute any of the major domestic beers, but they do have quite a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| smaller custom craft beers and they want to make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| It's not really available here, so it's a new opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| So there won't be any spirits, it's just beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Now, there is another company that would be doing the same thing on the same process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| be able to get a liquor license from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| It's not the R.S. Littman Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| They'd be prohibited from having a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| But there is another company, it's essentially a sister company, that would be, it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| similar to the company, you have a beer distributor and a wholesale distributor that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| And there's some small craft, and this really has to do with the way Tennessee defines beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Beer in Tennessee has to have an alcoholic content of 5% by weight or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| If you have a craft beer, sometimes those are 7% alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| And in those cases, they have to be distributed by a liquor wholesaler with an ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| So we will be having the sister company also when we get the TTB, the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| to approve the permit and the state to approve the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| We will be doing distribution of both low-proof beer and high-proof beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I know that we've had some of those breweries, if you will, before us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| So I mean, would I anticipate that you all would distribute their goods as well, local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| We would be distributing whatever, actually, whatever we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| And we'll sign up with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| We will be anxious to distribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| But right now, there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Marble City was the one that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Yeah, Marble City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| And it's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| We represent them in Nashville with our beer company, but not in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I second the motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I was just curious, how many employees will you have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=542)|
| 0:09:17| In Knoxville, it's probably four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=557)|
| 0:09:29| We will not opt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| We'll move, really, product Nashville being our largest warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and all these brands that we represent or have signed contracts for for this market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| we also have in Nashville and have had for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| And so we will probably, you know, from a warehousing, major warehousing standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| we'll move product from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| We'll bring it into Nashville and then move it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| So we won't necessarily operate a full, although, operational warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| but we'll have sales and delivery personnel for starting with four here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Talk to Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| She'll tell you what else you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| The next case is the Knoxome Lounge, and could you tell us about the records check, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=623)|
| 0:10:33| It just came and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| Mr. Ho has a conviction in city court for days and hours of retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| He was convicted on April 5th of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| If you gentlemen could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| My name is Toe Ho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| My name is Ty Ho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| And my address is 1610 Rising View Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Counsel, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| What is days and hours of retail sale conviction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| Sergeant Hunter, can you explain that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| He was written a citation for violating that ordinance, and he was convicted in city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| I don't have it verbatim here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I'd have to pull it up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I mean, does it mean selling after hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Is that what it means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Selling, allowing to consume, having alcohol open for consumption on the premises after 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| if it was a weekday, or it would be after 3 a.m. even on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| And then what about on the weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| It's 3 to 5 weekdays, and then Sunday morning it's 3 to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| I'm familiar with, I remember this, a year ago or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| But I guess my question would be, there's been other instances to where when folks have had this conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| they could go back to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| And I forget, it was recent that we had this very thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| And, Mr. Frost, I guess I'll call on you to ask, you know, could they go back to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| and what would be the process to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| He could either come off the application or go back to court and get this removed from his record, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| And I don't practice criminal defense law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| but I believe what the gentleman might attempt to seek is an expungement which would remove him from this record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| remove it from his record because the conviction which he has received is grounds for denial of a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| If the beer board, in its discretion, wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| they could defer this matter for a period of time to allow this gentleman to either seek expungement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| or to have him removed from the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Well, it's, okay, it's in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| It's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| And I would certainly entertain that and would be willing to make that motion to defer until a later date if that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I would second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Yes, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| So, perhaps to the, what's the beer board, 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| To February 21st to defer until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| But you understand what, if you could pull the microphone down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| You said that he was convicted in a criminal court, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| It was city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| City court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| I don't think you never went to court for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| When we spoke on the phone earlier today, he said he paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| When you pay a fine, it goes down as a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Oh, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Well, I will make the motion to defer this until the February 21st meeting to give them time to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| obviously there's confusion here as to perhaps if he went to court, it could have been a different outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| So I feel comfortable in making that motion for postponement, deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Counsel, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Counsel Mandela-Vogt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Counsel, I was just wondering, did you get the gist of the exchange here that there's kind of two options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| One is that you get a lawyer or you go back to court and you see if they will remove that from your record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| through some process of expungement or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Or secondarily, you take Mr. Thuckhose off the application and someone else be on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| because the bar goes to the owner who has a prior conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| So you either clean up the conviction, and you might want to consult a lawyer about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| or consider revising your application so that perhaps another person is applying instead of him for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=893)|
| 0:15:02| Now, you're talking about the Nossum Lounge permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| About the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| About the Nossum Lounge permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| So basically we could resubmit that under a different name, which is basically either me or someone in my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| That's one of your choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Why don't I go down and let me go ahead with the motion and maybe we can take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| and then I'll meet with them rather than tie up for this meeting and help them along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Vice Mayor Pavlos will meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| We have a motion and a second to defer this for 30 days or until the February 21st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| Next is the Taylor's Food and Deli, and I believe Jackie Jarrett is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Mr. Jarrett, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Jackie Jarrett, 37, well, the store address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| 5708 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=967)|

| 0:16:10| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=971)|

| 0:16:15| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Tell us what Taylor's Food and Deli is going to do on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Just the full deli, gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| Just the normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| If you will see Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| We have some other items on our agenda for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| The first is Sky Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| They were first approved on October 18th, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| And I believe Rafik Hanna is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Rafik sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I'm Matt Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| My address is 1741 Granada Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Ms. Martin, do you want to update us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| It was approved at your October 18th meeting and was extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1027)|
| 0:17:21| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1041)|
| 0:17:33| We sent them notice that their 90 days was expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| And that's why they're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Mr. Hall, what do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| If we could have an extension, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| We were hoping to get everything finalized and all the documentation in this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| We had some hiccups with furniture and communication and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| So it should be done within two weeks at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Well, February 21st, you'll be done by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| That's 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| I'll move to extend it to the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Councilman Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Are you saying that all the documentation is in and has been processed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| What's missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I believe it's health, fire, and final building, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| So what we are voting on is an extension to February 21st so that all the I's and T's are crossed and dotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1100)|
| 0:18:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| The next case is Trader Joe's, number 663 at 8025 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| And I bet this is Mr. Eubing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| I'm John Eubing from 2132 Branch Oak Trail, Nashville, Tennessee, 37214.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Now, I go by Trader Joe's site and I see things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| But I bet you're going to have a little delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I'm afraid so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| We're waiting for the site to be turned over from the landlord to Trader Joe's to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| So we're asking for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Now, this has been approved, but what we're doing is approving an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| 1690, tell me what you think you would need as far as days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Ninety days, I believe, is what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Do I have a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Ninety days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Doodles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| We have two items that were previously presented to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| The first is Doodles at 5000 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| And I believe Craig Cole is here with drawings and all other kinds of goodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Craig Cole, 5000 Clinton Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| We've granted one extension, and I know that you all ran into a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| That's an older location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| So tell us where you are, where you're going, and what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| We, at the time, the fire issues was with the whole complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| It wasn't because it used to be an old shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And the buildings were split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Like one building that we're part of was split into three different buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| And the fire panels had to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| It's an issue that had been going on for a while because other sections of the shopping center were like that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| So after we got involved in doing our planning and everything, which our plans were done on 11-2 for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1233)|
| 0:20:44| then when the fire issues came up, that was something that they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| we're going to address it now or we're not going any farther with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| We're not going to let it go anymore with the whole shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| So we got everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| We met with the fire chief, Mr. Danny Beeler, and the fire inspector, Kevin Bost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| That was on the third or fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And they said everything was in line now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| The company, Simplex, I believe, had got all of it straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And we got our --they signed off, I believe, on the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| And we got all our building permits on the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| And so we're under construction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Okay, so you do see the light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Yeah, we're in the tunnel, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I also think you've been there probably a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Oh, we've been there since 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| And I also overheard you say that you're ready to start hiring 50 to 60 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Yeah, we're getting our office under construction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| We're under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| We've got all our permits on the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Do you want 30 or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Sixty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Sixty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I don't want to come back up and buy the ends again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Okay, well, that probably works for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Do I have a motion to extend this procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Move to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Okay, we will see you either at Doodles for dinner or we will see you back here in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Anybody make a look at the plans or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Next is Organized Play, Morgan Hardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1333)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| This business first came to us on April the 19th, 2011, and has received several extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| I tried to talk to Mr. Hardy today, and I did not make any kind of phone contact at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| Mr. Frost, and then Councilman Grieve, we have some new VIER board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| Can you tell us what some options are in a case like this where we've had a number of extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| and we don't know anything, we have not heard from these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| Am I right, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| So tell us some options, and then we'll hear from Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Well, one potential option would be to give them one more extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| and politely request that when they're given it, it's in writing clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| uncertain terms that you need to make some sort of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| or there's the potential that you could be turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| You could also separately consider denying this without prejudice, where if these people came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| they wouldn't be getting turned down because there are some ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| if someone has their VIER permit turned down, or you could just outright turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| It could fail for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Those are the about four different options that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| This brings up a subject that some of us have been concerned about for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and the fact of how many times do we give someone an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| and to what extent do we give someone an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| What's their reason for doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| This particular one, we do remember that, in essence, we've given them a half a year to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| You've made an effort to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| It seems to me that there's some cost involved in this also in terms of us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| keeping someone on the docket for this length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| So I would move to deny this without prejudice anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| I think wouldn't we just not take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| I don't think it takes a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Well, but if we don't take any action, what happens, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| They die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| It dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| It goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| It goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And if we deny without prejudice, they still have an opportunity to come back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| So I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I just wanted to confirm for the attorney that they do get written notice and warned of the status of their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| And we send it by certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| And I'd be glad to provide you all with copies if that would help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| But that is part of our procedure, just for informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| I read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| So no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I guess I'm curious if you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I'm curious whether these people were making progress to get their building outfitted and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| so that they've been working towards opening the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| or whether this is sort of an indirect abandonment that they've just lost interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| Because it would matter to me, I think, that we do it with or without prejudice in the sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| if they've been working hard to get their facility open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| and for some reason they weren't clever enough to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I would like to give them another chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| But if they're not making progress on this, and this is just an application that they kind of walked away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| do we have any evidence from the staff that they have done any work out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1552)|
| 0:26:02| They were here in October, and they told us at that time, as we recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| that they were trying to get the building ready and had run into some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| And I don't remember any details about it, but we do remember that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| But we have not heard from them since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Well, I'd be willing to go by and see if they're there and check up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| So I would recommend that we do whatever we do without prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And if it comes up next time, we'll know one way or another what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| This business is operational, but they're trying to add beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| So they have an existing, ongoing business, and they just --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Have they turned in any of their completion activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| What is the status of their application right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| They're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| They've got their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Final inspections as required by code for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Just the final inspection for codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Well, with your indulgence, I will personally check up on this business and report back to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| If we can do it in a way that's without prejudice, I would prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| I want to send this out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So you want to make a law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| They're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| When was your last contact with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| The October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| The October meeting was the last time that we'd spoken to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| You know, I'm going to jump in, even though I haven't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Am I being recognized now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| I'm going to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| You know, I think that we have responsibilities as people on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| And I think the people coming before us have responsibilities also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| And this, I mean, to me, this has gone far beyond granting extensions to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| I mean, we gave them a 90-day, then we gave them another 90-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| And if they don't, if they're not astute enough to know what the calendar says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| and whether they should be here or not, I think that somewhere along the line we have to cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| And these people have been given a half-a-year extension for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| As a business person, I think that this says something about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| And, I mean, if this is important to them, then they should be here asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| and having all their documentation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| And if they've been notified and done the proper procedures on our side in terms of mailings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and this sort of thing and haven't responded, then I don't see, you know, extending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I'm going to look on this side of the room now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| We'll start with Mr. Wallace and then come back to Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| Well, I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I mean, that's their responsibility to get the stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I mean, I don't see continuing to approve people that are not even here to show up or ask for the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| It's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| But I think you've got to pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| And that's, you know, that's kind of my feeling, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I'd say 99 out of 100 folks that come and ask for these extensions are because of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| things that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And I remember the gentleman, because of the unique name of the business, that they were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| the business is up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| So, I mean, I can't see why, you know, why we would continue to extend this just like Councilman Grief said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| I mean, there's an expense tied to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| I mean, I don't think it's a great expense, but, you know, if you do one and then it starts snowballing, so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| where does it end, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| I just wanted to let you all know for clarity's purposes that we did send them a letter in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| notified them again in writing of their standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| And they --it was signed and returned to us as of December 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| So they were notified again in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Yes, Mr. Thayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| If this does die for lack of a motion, then they have to reapply, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| And how much does that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Well, the application fee is $250, and then there's other fees associated with an application, about $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Do I have a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| I'll ask one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Do I have a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Hearing no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Do we have anybody who wants to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Anybody signed up for public speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| This meeting stands adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120124?start=1859)|
