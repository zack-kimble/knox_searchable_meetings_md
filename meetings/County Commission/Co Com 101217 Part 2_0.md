| 0:02:39| Y Llywodraeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| Okay, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| 2-A-10-SAP is a request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| to adopt the amended East County Sector Plan in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| Commissioners, I want to address this, but first let me see if we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Do we have a motion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Motion has been made and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| I want to mention a couple of things, if I might, on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| because I know we have a lot of people here who are very interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| First of all, let me begin by saying that by virtue of the fact that I'm the Chairman of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| I'm also on the Development Corporation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| I receive no monetary gain for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| I receive nothing except a cup of coffee at 7.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| My being on that board will not influence my decision on how I vote here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| but I wanted to have complete disclosure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| I'd like to make the same disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I'd like to make the same disclosure and also make a statement that these are ex officio positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Also, I would like to see the pleasure of the Commission as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Obviously, this is a very passionate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| It's an issue of great concern, not only to the folks who live in the 8th District, but also to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| I'm wondering if it would be the pleasure of the Commission to limit debate on this to one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| We give each side 30 minutes to present their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| That does not include questions from Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| but that we have some type of time frame so that we can move expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| But I will do the will of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I'm just making that as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| I like that suggestion a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| I think what's happened in the past is when Commissioners interject with questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| that stretches that, you know, response out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| When the Commissioner takes time and response takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| and that eats into if there's a prepared amount of material that each side would like to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| it eats into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| So I guess what I'm asking is that we allow both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| if they're prepared to present in that way, to allow them uninterrupted time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| and then we could, you know, take over after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Yes, I have the same reservations as Commissioner McKenzie here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| And I was wondering if you wanted to limit to an hour, 30 minutes for each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| could we just say each side will get ten opportunities to get up and say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| and that way we don't have to limit it to an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| We can just say, if your intention is if we're doing three-minute presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| we model it to an hour, then that's 30 minutes per side, ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| And then that way we don't have to worry if we interrupt with questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| that we're taking up presentation time from one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Well, what the Chairman said was they would have 30 minutes plus our questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| so I think that takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| We want to give everyone an opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| but the bottom line is this has been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| We've had numerous hearings and public meetings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| If there's additional information that they want us to know, I think we can do it in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| But this is the will of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| We will do whatever the Commission wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| You know, I might make a suggestion that we let each side have their 30 minutes with no questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| and then if the Commissioners at the end of that 30 minutes wish to call one of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| that made a presentation back up to the podium, allow them to do that on the Commissioner's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| That's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Mr. Law Director, as we sit in this zoning board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| or whatever we're calling ourselves right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| would it be appropriate for us to limit anyone's testimony before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| The parties present are entitled to due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| and the Commission is also likewise entitled to have sufficient information to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| This is a matter that has been repeatedly before the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| and what you're really looking for at this point is new information, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| but you're certainly entitled to ensure proper administrative procedure to impose a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| So having heard that and not knowing how long it might take for everyone to offer their program, plan, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| we've heard it all before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| I think that we're all ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| I do not think that the testimony given to us this evening will in any way be constrained by 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| but I believe we need to avoid any appearance that we are trying to limit what takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| So I would just advise us to just move on with whatever is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| We're going to wear it out, and we're going to be done with it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Mr. Chairman, I trust your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| I think you'll know by the mood of the crowd and from the Commissioners, you're going to know when it's time to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| So I trust your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| I think we need to set a time limit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I mean, we could get a filibuster and be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| And we've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| We've done it before where we've been here until three o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| and I'm not exaggerating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| And I think we need to limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Every time we have a person come down here at the public forum, we give them five minutes or three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| And I think today to set a limit on this to 30 minutes for each side would be very fair considering the hours and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| We've had ten years now to get this out in front of the people voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I think 30 minutes on each side should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| And then the Commissioners can have the deliberations that we'll do afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| And, again, if there's some question about new information, we can call them back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| But otherwise we can run into a filibuster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| We could be here this time next week until everybody just says, I give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| U2's playing basketball at eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| We'll be dismissed by eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| A similar comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| We know probably most all of us know our position before the debate even starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| So I'd just like to empower the Chair to insist on information that is novel, is helpful, not redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=549)|
| 0:09:22| We get that so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| And so I hope you'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I'd kind of like to echo those things and then add we have Commission rules as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| So I guess what I'm addressing now is once the public has presented their arguments on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:48| and maybe this is for the Law Director, I think in the past we've been allowed, I mean strictly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| and I'm not saying that we adhere to this strictly, but just to kind of get what the Commission rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| I think we can speak to an issue twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| And there's time constraints around those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| So I don't know if I've kind of hit them cold with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| I'd like to try to get some guidance on that as well, because we have rules for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| We have rules to prevent a filibuster and to ensure that both sides have, you know, there's some equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:27| and there's an adequate vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And this issue has been, I don't think anyone can argue the fact that we've talked about it for a considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| So, Mr. Law Director, what is your position as to how we proceed from this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Is this the Chair's discretion or do we need to have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| Well, what you've suggested, Mr. Chairman, is not outside of your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and you have broad discretion in terms of eliminating debate and to ensure a good government process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| You can certainly proceed as you've suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| My determination is each side will get 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| At the end of the 30 minutes, Commissioners will begin to ask, you can ask questions and we will proceed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| But I think we do need to have some type of guidelines, so I'm going to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| So that's the Chair's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Let's first of all hear from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| They are the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| So, MPC, would you like to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I just want to remind you of your role this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| State law provides the Regional Planning Commission the authority to adopt and to amend the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| The East County Sector Plan is a component of that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| The Planning Commission adopted its update, East County Sector update, in February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| State law provides that in order to make that plan operative, and that's the word that is used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| it must be approved by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| The City Council has approved its portion of the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| That occurred May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| But the vote tonight is a vote either up or down on the plan that has been adopted by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| State law also provides an opportunity for the legislative body to initiate its own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| So in the event that you want to deviate from the Planning Commission's version of the update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| you can then in turn initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| It would then be sent, initiated by resolution with a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| It would be then sent to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| The Planning Commission would be provided the opportunity to either recommend approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| recommend denial, or make no recommendation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| It would then come back to you for your final consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| So keep in mind that you cannot amend the Planning Commission's version of the update on the fly tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| In order to deviate from the plan that was adopted by the Planning Commission, you must initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:23| With that in mind, I'll just summarize some of the highlights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| By the way, this is not part of the 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| This is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| This won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| That is in consonance with Tennessee Code 13-3304, to which Mr. Donaldson was referring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| That is the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| This plan and update is written with respect to the 2001 Knoxville-Farragut-Knox County Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=825)|
| 0:13:58| In the East County sector, 55% of the land area is designated by the Growth Policy Plan as rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=838)|
| 0:14:08| The East County sector plan update respects that classification and continues it in the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:17| Countywide, about 40% of the land in Knox County is classified as rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| with the balance evenly split between urban growth and planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| The short version of the Growth Policy Plan is to direct development into the urban and planned growth areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| and allow very low-density residential and agricultural uses in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:46| The controversial piece of property around the Midway Road intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| is within the planned growth area classification of the Urban Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| The plan is balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Future residential, commercial, and economic development activities are concentrated in nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| and along highway corridors within the urban and planned growth areas of the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| And the plan recommends design overlay districts for those highway corridors to manage signs, landscaping, access, and building design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:29| To preserve the rural character of the majority of the sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| the rural designation of the Growth Policy Plan is respected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| and one of the recommendations in the plan is to create a French Broad Conservation Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| which would constitute about 5,000 acres within the East County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| and another 5,000 acres on the other side of the river in the South County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| It proposes that we pursue the creation of a new agricultural zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| to create one that truly represents agricultural uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and break it away from the rural residential aspects of the current agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| It proposes the use of conservation subdivisions in order to preserve open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:32| the increase of the minimum lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| and the use of transfer or purchase of development rights programs to preserve prime agricultural lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:45| The plan reflects public input received during the process, which has extended for more than two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| In consideration of the French Broad River preservation interests, the plan states, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| the location of a sewage treatment plant in the French Broad Conservation Corridor is not recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| And the plan praises the concept of a tourism-related economic development strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| that expands recreational opportunities, provides entertainment facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| and small-scale lodging conference center or educational centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| The plan states, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| these concepts merit further consideration, particularly in the French Broad Conservation Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| and especially in places close to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Page 29 of the plan is a more detailed list of the elements of the plan that reflect public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:46| The criteria needed for making an amendment to the plan is addressed in Appendix D of the proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:59| And then it's important to keep in mind that the existing sector plan, which was adopted in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| designates the area around the Midway Road intersection as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| for approximately 300 acres of the 380 that the Development Corporation now owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| which would allow residential development of up to five units to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| and office development on about 80 of the acres now owned by the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| And that the transportation impacts, the environmental impacts and the fiscal impacts of the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| as compared to the proposed recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| we believe that the proposed recommendations reflect less of a transportation impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| less of an environmental impact and a greater positive fiscal impact on the county as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| So with that, I will step out of the way and let the clock begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| We will begin with those who are in favor of the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| You will have 30 minutes, so anyone who would like to speak to that, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| When you come, please give your name and address for our record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Also, I would ask that we be respectful of one another, even though someone may say something that you disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and we're asking that we be respectful of our fellow citizens as they speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| So we have 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Anyone who would like to speak in favor of the sector plan change, please come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| and state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| My name is Roger Osborne, O-S-B-O-R-N-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| I live at 7209 Lawford Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| First, I'd like to thank the commission for the time in allowing us to speak about this subject today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| I'm here really speaking in favor of the sector plan and the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| I'm really here in three roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| One, I am the chairman of the Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| I also feel like I'm a representative of the business community in Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| More importantly, though, I'm here as a citizen of Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| I really want to cover two things, and I'm certainly not going to take 30 minutes, and hopefully it will be less than 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| But I really want to talk about two things today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| One, the importance of economic development and job creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| And the second thing, I do want to talk about the Midway Business Park as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Economic development is really critical to the success of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| It's critical to the success of our families, our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and creating an environment that people want to come here and live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| They want to come here and work, that there are good jobs, and it's a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| And so it really is economic development is about jobs, but it's about much more than jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| It's about the quality of our life and our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| So I just want to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| Economic development requires long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| We can't create and do economic development in a year or two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| It takes three years, five years, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| It requires leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| It requires vision on the part of our leadership and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| And so I think we need to keep that point in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| The public sector has always played a key role in economic development in communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| and we certainly have evidence of that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| It started back in the 60s in Knox County, developed Forks of the River Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| That's been a successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| It's created over 5,000 jobs since its development in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| The Development Corporation was formed in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| The primary purpose was economic development for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Since then, we've created five business centers in different parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| We've created over 5,000 direct jobs, 5,000 indirect jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| and approximately $500 million in annual payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| So we have a strong track record in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| We have a successful track record of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| and we believe that we've done it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| A key factor in our ability to attract business to our community is having available land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| and having facilities and having people to move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| Currently, the Development Corporation has less than 400 acres of available land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:24| and 185 of that is in the East Bridge Industrial Park, which is about 12 miles off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| And while that is a quality project, it's not ideal for a lot of companies that might want to relocate here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| because of the distance from the interstate and major transportation areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| There also is a limited amount of developable land for industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| or business development in the city and in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| To give you some examples of sort of where we are versus other communities of similar size in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:06| while we have less than 400 acres, Chattanooga has 1,460 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| Greenville, South Carolina, has 2,600 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Roanoke, Virginia, 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Greensville, North Carolina, 1,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Birmingham, Alabama, 1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| And if you include Tuscaloosa, they've got almost 4,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| So we're woefully behind in the sites that companies have alternatives to view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| when they come to look at Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| We're behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| We're losing opportunities because we don't have available sites, and we really need to act now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| This is a long-term process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| We're already four years into the Midway Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| and to get it ready, if it were approved today, would still take us another three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| So it is about vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| It is about planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| It is a long-term commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| The second thing I wanted to talk about was just the Midway Business Park in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| The Development Corporation purchased the property in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| and the thought process behind the purchase of that property was there was a lot of due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| a lot of thought, a lot of planning that went into that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| In 2002, the Metropolitan Planning Commission conducted two studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| to review potential sites for business park development and accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| They came back, and that was updated again in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| They came back with a number of available sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| but really only three or four were real opportunities that were available to view for economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| or for business development in a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| One of those was the Midway site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| And in conjunction with the studies from the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| the Development Corporation of Knox County got options to purchase that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| and the purchase was subject to the rezoning of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| And in 2006, Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 12-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| to recommend the rezoning of the property in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| In August of 2006, the County Commission voted 16-3 to approve the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:51| And subsequent to that, and only after that zoning was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| the Development Corporation acquired the property based on those assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| And based on that zoning as commercial or business property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| that property was acquired for an average of about $25,000 an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| versus an agricultural probably valuation that would be about $5,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| As everybody knows, subsequently there was a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| The sector plan was overturned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| and for the last four years we've been trying to work with the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| work with the citizens in the area, work with the county to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| have a quality sector plan, but have a sector plan that includes opportunity for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| and expansion of business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| I would say that, again, there's less than 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| It's on an interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| The adjacent property in the interchange is zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| which is a much less restrictive zoning than what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| This is proposed to be zoned as an employment center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and it's going to be much more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| And even if the sector plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| we still will have to come back and have the approval of the Planning Commission for the planning of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| and then each project after that would have to be approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| So there's still a lot of opportunities to approve the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| and what goes on in this business center when it's ultimately approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:44| We have attempted to work with the Planning Commission and the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| and we want to build a quality project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| We want a project that the community can be proud of, not ashamed of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| that is going to create the opportunities that we all want for the future of our kids and our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| And we're committed to doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| and we will do what it takes to build a quality project that this county can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| And I think it will be one of the best business centers that anyone has seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| We estimate that on completion that this has the potential to create 2,000 direct jobs, 2,000 indirect jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:30| and over $200 million in payroll for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| It's not going to happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Again, it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| It's long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| But it certainly has the potential to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| At the end of the day, I want to sum up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| At the end of the day, really we feel like this vote is about economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| whether we want to have economic development in a controlled and a positive way in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| Do we want to create jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| In a way, it is about jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| But, again, it's more important than jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| It's about creating a community that people want to be, that they want to relocate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| that we're going to have quality jobs, that people can build a good future here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| So it really is an important decision in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| A vote for today, I think, is a vote for all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| A vote against today is a vote against all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| There's an economic decision here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| The property was acquired at about $25,000 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| and I think everyone needs to understand if this doesn't get rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| there's a material adverse impact on the valuation of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| which is an important factor, I think, for the commission and everyone to consider and understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| The other thing I would say in closing is this project is not just for the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:13| It's not the Development Corporation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| This is our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| It's Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| It's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| It's the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| It's the Knox commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| It's the Development Corporation, and it's the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| It's our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| It's all of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| It's all of our futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We all have a vested interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| It's not about the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| This is not about business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| This is about doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| It's about having vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| It's about having leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It's about doing the right thing for the future of Knox County and the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| And I'll end there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| We have a couple of other people that would like to speak in favor of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| and we'd be happy to answer any questions or technical questions later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I'm Todd Napier, Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| I hadn't really come prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| I've got a presentation here I can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| But, you know, going first is always a challenge, especially in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| because I feel like I'm always on the defensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| Those who have opposed this project have relentlessly continued to throw new things up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| that we are always having to defend, yet there seems to be no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| Throw it, let's see what sticks, and use all their time defending those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| So I'm going to pleasure them in using some of my time in defending those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| And if we could potentially get our computer here to go up there onto that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| But just to give you some sense of the ridiculousness of what's said without accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| we have been recently accused on one of the local blogs of going to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| and changing the state law in order to accommodate our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| And then one of the brilliant posters after that went on to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| well, I think Rhonda Rice worked for the Farm Bureau as a lobbyist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| before she worked for the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| It's absurdity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| And I just want you to know the level of absurdity that we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| One of the things that, you know, we're really dealing with is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| why do we develop the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Why do we pick this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And if you could go kind of, so I'm going to hit a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| One of the things is Karst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| This area is nothing but Karst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Why would anybody develop on Karst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| You can see up there on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And I couldn't get the larger expanded, but if you look at most of eastern Kentucky, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| down into Georgia, Virginia, this whole area is underlain with Karst geology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| which is subject to caves and sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| And certainly we have certainly never hid the fact that there are some sinkholes on the far eastern portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| and a couple of others that we're going to work around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| So to say that this land is unsuitable for development because of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| is to say that all of east Tennessee and Kentucky is unsuitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| So, Brenda, if you could just kind of keep going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| I can speak to some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Go on to the, keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Let's talk about the next one there on the green, if you would, the farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| Next one over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Let's talk about the fact that Knox County has been treated as the last bastion of agricultural property in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| The fact is over 50% of, now you don't need, it's a graphic, it's in your book, it's under page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| It's all of this fact that this is the last bastion of agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| The fact is almost 50% of Knox County is rural and agricultural or vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| Let's talk, and we talk about on page six, soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| The fact that the soils are these pristine soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| If you look at the fact, if you look at that, most of the property on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| this prime farmland is going to be eaten up with the TVA substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| We have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And down a drainage way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| I want to go to the fact that this is on the, if you'll go, Brenda, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2148)|
| 0:36:00| If you'll go to 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| That will work much better than me trying to give you directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| What you're going to see on this map here is the fact that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| is the fact that our property is on the north side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| It's over two miles away from the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| And there's one, at least one major ridge to three major ridges between that and the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| So the impacts on the French Broad are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| There have been pictorials done in some of the publications that show pictures along the French Broad River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| and are anti against this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Very misrepresenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| This is just some old farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Some of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Some of it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| There's, you know, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| What is special?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Let me talk to you about what is special about the property we bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| It's the fact that 35 years ago the federal government invested millions and millions of dollars to benefit this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| and also to benefit the interstate commerce and develop this interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| And this laid undeveloped for over 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Well, you know, those that are against what we're trying to do, I guess would say that it should lay undeveloped for another 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| that we should continue to realize zero value, in essence, from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| We have one farmer on there that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| He rented the land from Mr. Rural Brewer before and we're continuing to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| You know, he basically is able to support himself with this plus other property develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| Now, the agricultural significance of this property versus the significance that it would bring to our community as a farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| there is no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| He's able to basically employ one person in his family versus what we project would be up to 2,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| So I think it's just bad use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And then this whole notion of let me talk about the USDA grant for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:23| If our elected leaders were to take almost 400 acres of interstate interchange property and say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| I think the highest and best use of that property for now and forever is that it be used for nothing other than farming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| or is vacant property, that would be a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| It would be unbelievable that we would lose that kind of value on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| It's a decision made on a whim that would forever say that that will add no economic benefit to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2331)|
| 0:39:00| And when you run the math, you know, Roger talked about the fact that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| if this property cannot get past agricultural zoning, its value is going to be around $5,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| If you run that out and you say, okay, what's the value if an easement is put on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| And say that brings that down to about $2,000 an acre, you know, 1 or 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| The difference of that easement value is about $3,000 to $4,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| At best, the USDA may provide 50% of that value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| So we're talking about here, that's about $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| They would come in and provide 50% of that easement value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| So now you're at about $500,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| To trade that $550,000 of interstate interchange property to never be used for anything else is just not good sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2392)|
| 0:40:03| and the math's not there, plus we've got about $10,000 invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| Let's talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| If you'll go to 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Brenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| That's a PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| I have heard from a lot of people who I respect and believe to be intelligent that there is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:35| Can you go to full view on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Slideshow view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Well, anyway, if you can't, we can look at it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| That there's thousands of industrial acres along Rutledge Pike that we should use for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| If you're looking for a page, if you'll go to page 12, that we could use for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2452)|
| 0:41:09| The fact is there is very little industrial property that's not already in use on Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| It's almost nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| That property actually is along the railroad tracks in the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| And I'm going to, if you'll go to the next slide, I'll work you through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| I know this property very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I've been on a lot of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| So you start off with, you've got the Dixie Cement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| That property's in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Then you go down, there's about 65 acres of property that sits behind the Popular View Landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| I've personally checked with a railroad about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| They can't get you a grade crossing because they can't guarantee, and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| we often block it loading cars at the John Sevier Railyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| So access, unless somebody's willing to buy it, behind the landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| or willing to build a bridge across it at several million dollars, it's not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| And if you go down, you can see there's the Strong Farm property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| If you'll go to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| It's about 385 acres there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| It's on the river, most of it, on the other side of the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| You'd have to figure out how do you get a grade crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| And it's not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Then you move on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| You've got about 196 acres that, when this map was done, was actually still industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| It's been down-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| It's now a low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| I've got the copy of the deed here in my stuff that says it was only sold with surface rights only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| So if you bought it, you couldn't be unsure that there wouldn't be any mining activity underneath your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| There's a site that's right across from Eastbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| So now we're actually in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| We're not even in the Rutledge Plate Corridor anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| So now you're in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| You've got about 116 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| It's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| And there's a little blow-up of what it actually looks like across from Eastbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| of a place that was used as part of a zinc mining operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| And then there's some property just up from it where you've got another 94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| Most of it's very steep sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Then if you'll move to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| So then we've got, you know, coming over here to the far right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| you've got stuff that's part of the actual National Historical Register sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I've got a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| So let me go back to the history of why there is even industrial property in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| It's not on Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| It's over around where the mines were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| The mines owned all this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| They bought it, and as they've sold off pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| some of it was rezoned as it was used for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| And they took a straight edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| If you'll go back two slides, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Well, you can see where the way zoning was done back in the early days was they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| well, here's a railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Let's make everything on both sides of the railroad track industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| What I was hoping to do, you can see on the strong, they take a straight edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| and you take a straight edge and you go here, this is industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| It doesn't have much to do with anything other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| So that's why we have some industrial property in the Rutledge Pike mascot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| But don't let that be a reason why you don't think we need this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| It's untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| So if you'll go down to the forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Let's talk about forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Mr. Napier, let me say that you have five minutes, just so you're on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| Well, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| It's in your books on page 13 and 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I'm going to leave five minutes for rebuttal, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Or you can use your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I'd rather use it for rebuttal because I don't know what's going to be said that needs to be responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Well, the way we're going to do this, you have 30 minutes, they'll have 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| and then the commissioner is going to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Well, I would just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Forks of the river is not empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| You can look at your aerials there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| There's very little land in forks that actually could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| There's a few empty buildings that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| There's two buildings that make up 70% of the vacant space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| That's the C-Ray building and the Panasonic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| So, like I said, it's hard to know how to defend yourself when everything in the world is being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| But this is a good plan, East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| We implore that you please approve that so we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| and provide opportunities, long-term economic development for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Anyone else like to speak in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| We have about four minutes remaining and this is your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| Go to the one with the two charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| My name is Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I'm the president of the Chamber 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| If you can read these two, I think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| I don't know if you have them in your books, but you don't have them in your books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:28| The one on the left is a chart of the way Knox County, the East Knox County sector is distributed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:39| And you can see the blue represents ag, open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| The sort of the rust color represents business, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| And I believe the greenish blue represents residential on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| On the right is what would be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And if you look, the major shift in the East Knox County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| or if you're looking at what is going to be the significant impact, is in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| The thing that you have to remember on this sector plan, whether you vote for it, to not, or against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| it's still going to have the least amount of industrial property in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| And to not, on this sector plan, whether you vote for it or against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| it's still going to have the most agriculture and open space in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| So how the encroachment into agricultural space is a straw man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| It is a question of whether or not that Knox County needs a place to grow jobs that will take us three years to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| But by 2014, everybody believes we're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Our prospect list is clearly looking with lot manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| I'd be darned if I think that this community needs to ever say that Knoxville is not going to get lot manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| But we've got to have the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| We've got to have the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| And the East Knox, the Midway site has been well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| It has had opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Land use always has opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| But this is the site that Knox County needs to grow jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| The end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| And you're just about right on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| There may be a few seconds here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| But, as I said, the commissioners will be able to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Okay, those who are against this proposal, you will have 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And if anyone would like to come forward, please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2935)|
| 0:49:05| Jim Clark, 8003 Thorngrove Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| I am speaking and representing all of the people from the community that include the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| the 8th District Preservation Association, the Thorngrove Community Center, the 1100 member of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| and many citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| All of these people are passionate volunteers who have become actively involved in the process of our representative government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| as it pertains to the East County Sector Plan that is before your vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| We are pleased with the East County Sector Plan as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| Our opposition pertains to the zoning change at the Midway intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| We consulted Metro Policy for analysis of the Development Corporation's Business Park proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| and have submitted a copy to the commissioners for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Based on that analysis, along with the OX report that we submitted earlier in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| we have concluded that this is a bad business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Current availability on inventory in Knox County can accommodate almost 5,000 new jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:21| Putting people to work today should be our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| To stay competitive, Knox County's economic development strategy must change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| to reflect the structural changes occurring in the national economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| Build it and they will come is based on speculation and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Hope is not a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| According to prominent business leaders, quality of life and a highly educated workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| are key factors in recruiting business and talent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Capitalizing on our strengths to position Knoxville for the future is the way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| Building a vibrant, sustainable economy that enhances our quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| with the natural beauty of the area is a strong economic strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| We respectfully request this commission amend the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| with the recommendation to change the zoning at the Midway intersection to its current zoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Does anyone else wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| No one else wishes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| I just want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity that wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Commissioners, do you have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I'm not going to go into, you know, all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I mean, we've heard these things over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| And I'll say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| I really appreciate the people in opposition to this keeping your argument short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| That made a bigger impression than just about everything I've heard the last three years, you know, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| And so we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| The thing that I would like our commissioners to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| and it's really what I would like to see us base our decision on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| is not try to decide what's good for now or what's going to be good for next summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| but to step back and do something that's not been done very often in Knox County amongst their leaders in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| is to say, if we look back on this five years from now or ten years from now, what's the best choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| And both those for this project and against this project will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| if we look back in five or ten or 20 years from now, is that their choice will be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| But let's look just a little bit at some of the things that have occurred in the past ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| This week, in the new sentinel, we saw that the population from Knox County has gone from 380,000 people up to around 430,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| That's a 50,000 population gain in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| The question is, where are those people working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| And in the next ten years, if the population continues to increase like this, where are they going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and what are they going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| And these last ten years have not been economically good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| We had the setbacks after the 9-11 attacks, and, of course, we've had what's being referred to now as the Great Recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| which has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| So it's not been a real good time for economic development, but we've still gained 50,000 people in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| We've talked a lot about if the land remains zoned agricultural, what we can do to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:47| There's been proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| I've received a lot of e-mails, and most of these are things that are cc'd to all the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| that we should do everything from making this a switchgrass collection site to making it an Appalachian tourist center to making it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| I had someone wrote a letter saying we need to grow tomatoes out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| because that would be good use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Other people have suggested we absolutely turn it into a complete tourist center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| because of its proximity to the exits up at Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| Now, if we look ten or 15 years ahead, and let's say some of those things do happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| We have some sort of agricultural center out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| What is that going to actually entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| If we make it a 350-acre tomato farm, we're going to have a lot of illegal aliens that will be very happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| because they're the people that are out there picking tomatoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| because it's not going to be Knox County residents picking tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| The study that was performed on what type of jobs that these agricultural jobs pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| most of those jobs don't pay over $8.50 an hour, and they do not have benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| Some say let's make it a tourist center. Let's benefit from the tourist center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Does anyone really want that exit to look like Pigeon Forge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| I think the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| The exit was put there, as was mentioned, by the federal government so it could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| The government didn't put an exit there for trucks to come in and out to drop off switchgrass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| or to take out tomatoes or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| That interchange is zoned commercial now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| I have a young lady that has a small farm, and her address is Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:40| I see her every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| She has begged me to allow that industrial park to develop, that business park to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| because she knows that once you don't have those restrictions that taking away some of that commercial zoning entails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| that there's going to be gas stations, there'll be motels, there'll be Kentucky Fried Chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| there'll be the fast food places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| And she says that what these things will attract are people coming off the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| that certainly are some of the most undesirable people that could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| There's good people, too, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| but there's very many undesirable people that get off the interstate that goes to those places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| and she will not feel safe for her children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| She would much rather have a business park there that, in the evenings, has private security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| they have county sheriffs making patrols, the place is aesthetically drawn up well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| where even her kids could even go and ride their bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| and the area pretty much will be protected from these things that she doesn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| She lives on Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| The final thing, and it brought to mind when Larry Smith is very good, he's our commissioner over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| and he's really very good at pointing out that we really have to think about the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| because ultimately it's their money and it's their business that we're conducting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| Unfortunately, the development corporation has already invested $10 million into this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| and has been brought forward already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| If this is zoned commercial and it's protected as commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| the value will go from $10 million that's invested into it now to less than $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:29| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| We argued right before this meeting started, we argued for about an hour about $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| that was going to go to one of the drug courts to try to save the county some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| about whether that $20,000 should really be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| What are we going to tell people about the $8 million that won't be used for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| We've talked about developing the brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| That $8 million will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| We can't use that for something else if this passes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| Ten or 15 years from now, do we really want the citizens, when we don't have good jobs here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| do we want the citizens to say what were they thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| I mean, what were they really thinking if they were looking at the future of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| when they squandered $8 million that's not going to be used for economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| and we don't have the jobs we need here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| I'm very quickly going to mention one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| It's a very complex story, but it deals with what they call the wage index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| I work in the medical field, as some people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| We lost one hospital system in this town about two years ago when the Baptist system went under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| The Mercy system, if you've been reading the papers, has been having difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| It's not because they don't have a lot of patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| It's not because they don't run an efficient business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| It's a problem because of the wage index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Our wage index is about .78 or .79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| This is lower than Memphis's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| It's lower than Chattanooga's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| The Mercy system is in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| It's up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Very well, if a for-profit buys this, we'll probably close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| I don't know if it will or not, but I would bet that the old St. Mary's Hospital will close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| They'll probably do something to expand it up north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| But what about the people that live in that area that's being served by that hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| What about the jobs that are going to be lost there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| And that's because our wage index is so low here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| We can't continue to attract these low-wage jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| It has an impact all the way across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| People say we need to develop small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| It's small businesses that service the large businesses that would settle here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| if we can attract the right type of industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| You know, I think this is really a turning point about what we're going to do in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Our history has been one of lost opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| And the question is, are we going to miss another opportunity tonight by not voting for this sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| to bring good jobs into Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| I hear people say all the time, we need to listen to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| We need to listen to what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Out where I live, I've not heard anyone say that they think it's a bad idea to try, at least try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| to bring good jobs into this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| I can tell you, if we don't have the land, we're not even in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| I don't know how things are going to be five or ten years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| but if you don't have the land, we're not even playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| People aren't even going to come and look at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And when people say we need to listen to the people, we got this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It came out of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I know everyone on the commission has seen this because we get emails saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| you've got to listen to the people, you've got to listen to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Two to one, two to one, the people that responded to the mayor's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| who responded to the last two, I guess you'd call them community gatherings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:11| people said they wanted this to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| I'll leave it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| The one last thing I'll say is that as far as the idea of things looking good and not looking bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| I was one of the original members of Scenic Knoxville, just like some of the people out here are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| and I believe very much in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| But the motto of Scenic Knoxville is progress is inevitable, ugliness is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| And I think it's absolutely imperative that we go forward this evening and vote for this sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:54| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| I would like to thank everybody for being here on a Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| I'm sure there's better places to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| But I want to talk a little bit about how I came to my decision because it wasn't easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| In 2008, when I was elected, I think I met with three members of the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| and we talked about the process that I had to learn a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| It's not just a matter of a business coming in and visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Research has started six months before they even make a phone call to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| The chamber is probably the last ones to know that a business is looking for an opportunity in Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| And learning the process and understanding that, you know, the major cry is right now we've got empty business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:46| My district has a completely empty business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| Hardin Valley Business Park is completely empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| But I understand that we're trying to associate businesses that would work well with Oak Ridge Associated Universities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3773)|
| 1:03:02| and ORNL and research and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| I understand that we want to make that a research and development park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| We want to have nice start-up companies with high-paying jobs, six-figure jobs in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| That's the vision for that park, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| Do I call Rhonda and ask her why it's not full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Yes, but I understand what the park was built for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| We have Pellissippi Corporate Center, who has some empty spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| But I understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| I mean, you're not going to get all the businesses all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| We lose more than we win in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| If ten businesses call on us and we get one, that's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| I think that, you know, and I've been on existing business visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| and I've seen how the chamber works with existing businesses talking about energy grants and TVA programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| KUB programs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| I know that they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Now, do I always agree with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| I've sat, you know, and talked to them about potential businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| Some are private, some went public and we didn't get them, or some went public and we did get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| Some of the things that I've heard, talking about Routledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| I used to live near Routledge Pike and understand the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| Somebody made a point to me the other day that even though we had the best of times in the 90s and early 2000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| Routledge Pike didn't develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| It didn't develop to its full potential, and there's reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| It's location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| And then I think back to when we were building Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| There was as many people against Turkey Creek as there is against Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| They fought Turkey Creek tooth and nail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| Currently, if you go down there between now and December the 24th at probably 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| you won't be able to park down there, and they fund about $12 million of your school system every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| It's done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| Earlier this statement was made, putting people back to work is the goal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| We do need to put people to work today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Our government needs to operate in a way where business wants to come here and they want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| But this park is not about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| This park is about five and ten years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| This park, the Development Corporation has talked about, people are worried about truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| This park is going to have limited, if no, distribution centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Todd didn't mention that, but that's a concession that was made from a concern to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| You know, and when you're a builder and you're developing a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| you don't wait until somebody buys a house to cut the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| People have to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| People have got to know that you're serious about putting a subdivision there before they sign the contract on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| And that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| That's basically where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| And my fear is if we don't have vision and leadership in ten years, 15 years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| we may still be that little scruffy city by the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| And I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| I want businesses to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| I call Mike Edwards every time, somebody in the surrounding county, and I know we're regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| but I call him every time and tell him we lost and I'm mad about it because I hate to lose a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| But not all businesses are for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| But Knox County needs to have available property to be successful in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| And that's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| I defer to Commissioner Wright first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| I don't know why he wants to speak last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| This is such a good topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| I believe I said at the work session that this has been something that's been around, predates us, predates this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| It predates new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I think the first meeting that I went to outside this room was a planning session on the East Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| and it was at the Burlington Branch Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Since then, we've had meetings frequently about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| And I think we've probably met so long that we have our minds made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| and it could be possible that we just stop right now and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| but I don't know what I need to put before us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| I'm speaking as the eighth district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| I've heard this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| This project of driving people east on the interstate will have us driving by good brownfields in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4072)|
| 1:08:02| It's going to promote sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| In this time of economic hardship, it's hard to justify this kind of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| especially on a business park that's going to be in the middle of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| I personally believe that the job creations that have been brought before us are probably a little overly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| And then let me back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| There are probably numerous private places, not development corp or chamber partnership places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| but there's empty space in numerous private developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| The local community in the eighth district, as I say I represent, has never wanted this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| And one of the drawbacks has been up until this point in time that there's not been any viable alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| to what do we do with our $10 million worth of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| I believe there are two or more good alternatives on the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:12| I guess it boils down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| It's about return on investment or are we putting good money after bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| And if we are, maybe it's time for us to look at where we are and actually say, well, we need to take a new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:30| Commissioner Brown wanted to speak after I did for some reason or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| The dilemma that I'm now faced with is that I'm hearing mixed signals from a couple of directions on what's going to be the next move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:47| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| A couple of memoranda that you've authored for us seem to indicate that the ultimate decision lies with commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:04| and I need to know how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| As the motion is currently on the table, it's to approve the East Sector Plan as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:17| If we leave it that way, then I'll vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| But is that the proper place to leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Can I offer a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4226)|
| 1:10:35| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| If there's a motion on the floor, you can certainly offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I would offer then and make sure that I phrase and choose very sweet words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| because I don't want to have to have anyone eat any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| I'd like to offer the following substitute motion then to amend the amended East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4255)|
| 1:11:04| as presented by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| by removing what I will call E-C-O-7, which I believe designates East County number seven page of the presented plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:29| More specifically, I'll call it the Northwest Quadrant of the Midway Interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| and return this request, which we're dealing with, is 2A-10-SAP to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:46| Mr. Law Director, would I be proper and appropriate if I were to offer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| There may be some infirmities there, but I think you should hear from Mr. Donaldson on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you, Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| I believe the way that I'm reading TCA-13-304 is that in order to make the Planning Commission's adopted update operative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| you need to vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Once that is done, the legislative body, you, the county commission, can initiate your own amendment by resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:25| and I would prefer that that be a resolution on an agenda with a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| rather than an amendment of the plan that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| I'll change your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| The issue is, in terms of the verbiage, I think it's accurate, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| I think procedurally, generally, because we haven't been down this path before, but as a general rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| you either adopt the plan as submitted or you reject it, and then you subsequently submit a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| Normally, that new plan would be submitted by way of a resolution because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| it's going to outline with specificity what the amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| Which would not take place tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Yeah, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I don't think we want to get into a situation where we're trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Well, you'd actually have to send back an amended plan by way of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Based on that interpretation of where we are, I will be voting against this sector plan implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:43| and would ask that my fellow commissioners vote against it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Now, Dave, I am glad I waited until last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| I've got a lot of concerns over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| I just think that it's been batted around for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| Suddenly at the last minute we're getting all the information that we should have had six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| whatever, whenever it first came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| It just smells a whole lot like a snow job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| I know we've got some big guys in there who are supposed to be doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| but I just don't feel like that when I can go out here the last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| and I come up with two different lists, Mr. Donaldson referred in the sector plan that there's 380 acres out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:39| which is LDR in this case and 80 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| I also mentioned 5,000 acres on the north side of the river and 5,000 south that was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| One list I have has 1,320 acres of acreage available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| Another one, almost 2,300 acres available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| But yet Mr. Osborne says they only have 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| Now, of course, 100 acres is in East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| That may be just what they control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| But the way I see a development corporation is not necessarily to push their own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:24| Maybe they didn't buy the best properties yesterday, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| The way I see their operation should be to be pushing the best properties that will bring the best development to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:39| When you look at the chart in Mr. Tharp's report, we're talking about manufacturing out there on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:48| But yet in Tennessee, in Knox County, excuse me, the last eight years, manufacturing has gone down 39% in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4548)|
| 1:16:00| While we turn around and look at finance and insurance, it's a 43% increase, 70% in management of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| The others that are arts and entertainment, 33%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| There are a lot of areas that are doing a whole lot better in increases right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| And if I was looking at a place to put some money, I'd be wanting to put my money where it's making money right now, not where it's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| This is not like a stock market where you buy low and sell high and bet on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| You know, we're betting with, as has been pointed out here several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| people's tax money in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Getting back to what Commissioner Wright said a while ago, I don't think we're ready to do anything with that property out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| I don't think it's necessary to do anything with that property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| I think it needs to be left out of this equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| We can sit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| It's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| And I'll be the first to tell you guys this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| I am not going to put it in any kind of land bank and tie it up forever either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| I think that would be the most worst use of anything we could do with it to tie it up forever like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| But I don't feel like it's a proper time to be using that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| I think they need to take some of that $17 million they've got that they're planning on developing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| Let's promote some of these sites, the brownfields of buildings that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Let's get some people in here in some of these areas that are doing business right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| and are having increases right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Let's get them in here and build some economy back in here before we can go out there and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:48| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Let me make a couple of comments about the thoughts I've had on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| and the response I've had from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| And I'll do my best not to ramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| And then I may have a question or two for Todd at the end of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Of course, I was a business person all my career, worked in banking and railroading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| pretty much the core fields of capitalism in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| And I've always supported initiatives from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| I can't remember one I didn't, either sitting here as commissioner or previously as a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| A year and a half ago, I took a bus ride with Todd and maybe some of the people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| As a councilman, we started, I guess we started on the Market Square and drove out to East Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| and then drove up and down Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| And I, frankly, was struck at the inventory of available land for business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| I was struck that I was surprised that it was what appeared to me as I'm a neophyte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| I'm not a business development person or a recruiter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| But I thought, gosh, that's a lot of land and we need another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| That sort of just jumped out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| In the debate over this the last few weeks, I've constantly heard pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Look what Chattanooga did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| Volkswagen, now in the last few weeks, Amazon.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| Gosh, Volkswagen went in a brown field or a gray field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| It went in an old T&T plant or I don't know what kind of color field you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| but it went in an old industrial rundown site, 1,300 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| Navazon.com, I think that's also Hamilton, Chattanooga and also Bradley County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| If I'm not mistaken, there's no distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| It was just mentioned a minute ago that someone would be allowed in this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| So that sort of takes those two off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| I think the big victories that we've had in business development in our community, the big hits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| Green Mountain Coffee, a lot of us were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| That went in, Forks of the River, an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Republic Plastics, I worked on that when I was in the railroading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| I was out there for the chamber for ribbon cutting, an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| Smoky Mountain Materials went into an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Cisco went into an old brownfield, the Coffster yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| I'm looking at the, I agree the value of this property, if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| if what the motion on the table doesn't go through tonight, the value will drop drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| But we need to remember there's $17 million there already from the tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| from us, the Knox County taxpayer, sitting there that will need to be spent, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| A minimum of $17 million will need to be spent to develop the infrastructure, roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| the stuff containing sewage, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| And so I just, I guess my question is how I became a little disillusioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| or somewhat disillusioned with this project was because of the inventory of business parks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| I know East Bridge, apparently not a success, not on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| Well, the other ones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| I know some are corporate centers, some are business parks, some are this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| But they are on an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| If we're calling Pellissippi Parkway an interstate, I think it's 140, isn't it, or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| And what's not on here is that $5 million that the Knox County taxpayer has out there in Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| the end of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I forget what that's called, Pellissippi something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| A beautiful place, and I understand 9th County's one vision and regional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| I hope something goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| But, you know, having a shovel full of dirt been turned over out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| I understand the economy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| But it seems to me we have a lot of capacity for these places to go if you want a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4913)|
| 1:22:05| It also seems to me, and I know Todd had the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I drove around Fortson River a couple of times in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| But there's a dozen Baker Realty signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| There's a Baker Realty sign in every other building, something for sale or for lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| And if I were moving a project from Toledo, Ohio, to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| I'd sure first look at an existing building, try to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Again, I'm no expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| That's just me throwing it out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| This is a very divisive issue, and that sort of, I guess, sums up my synopsis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| And I guess I would ask, give Todd the benefit of the doubt if he wants to address those four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| or five-plus business parks I've thrown out there on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| That's what's made me say the question, do we need another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| And is this business model that we've been using for 40 or 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| if Fortson River was built in the 60s, is it still valid to buy two 500 acres of farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| and split it up with roads and split it up into 10 or 20 acre lots and sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| If that's valid, why do we have so many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And I'm just asking that because I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Well, I disagree that we have too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| We've got, just to reiterate kind of what you talked about, East Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| it's about 180 acres thereabouts out in East Bridge, which is over half of our inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:40| So then you go back out to the west, Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| Commissioner Anders talked about Hardin Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| We've got about 70 developable acres in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| One or two businesses could take the majority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| Then at West Bridge, we've got about 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| Center Point, six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Pellissippi Corporate Center, about 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Let's see if I missed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| I think I covered them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| And if Works the River, you know, as far as like the empty buildings, the good buildings will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:21| The mountain went into a good building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| You know, there's some other good buildings in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| There's been some buildings recently in Works the River that have sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Some are in play right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| I can't necessarily speak to because I don't think those deals are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| So the good buildings will fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| And in the current economic times, if a building meets your needs, you're going to buy it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| This business park is a long-term proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| And you're looking at this through a very narrow frame, or it appears to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:57| And this is a 5-, 10-, 15-year investment in our community and our ability to create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| So I don't think anybody's ever denied that there are existing buildings and some inventory of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| But that is not going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| And we have to be thinking today about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| I don't know where all this brownfield property exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| It's being mentioned that it's so viable to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| I mean, I showed you one of the brownfield pieces, what I call brownfield, out by East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| You know, Kosher Shop's been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| What's left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| The railroad's been very, very difficult to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| We've talked to them many times about trying to, you know, move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| And we've been unsuccessful in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I guess in your history maybe you might understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| I don't know if you ever tried to negotiate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Very bureaucratic, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| And so, you know, we did a complete study several years ago of all of what you would call the historic center city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:59| And the sites aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| And we shared that at different times with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| Talking about Pellissippi Place, you know, that was an investment that was made by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| There's going to be, out of that development, ultimately about 230 acres that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| The criteria for going into Pellissippi Place, which is the one you referred to in Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| is that 60% of the jobs have to be in scientific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| You have to be basically in scientific production type to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| And there's some floor space requirements that are the same as one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| So it's very, very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| We talked to them down there and they said that's a 50-year project because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| And the rest of that development is housing and retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| So, well, yes, we've got some empty buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| You know, we hope to, you know, continue to fill those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| We certainly expect they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| And the good buildings will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| But not every company that's looking here will be able to find a building that will meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| In some instances, their building may be so specialized that such a building doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| So, you know, we have to be able to have a broad spectrum of product in buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| and land that's going to meet community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| And that also has to do with location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| And, you know, location on the interstate and proximity has always been key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And I don't know, Rhonda, is there anything else you would add to any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Certainly is very involved, her and Doug Lawyer, in dealing with prospects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| And hopefully I've addressed that adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| The only, you mentioned Brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| We both mentioned Brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I guess the only thing you have in here is the Baxter Avenue, what I would call a Brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| That's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| IDB has that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| You know, we've had that marketed for about four years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| And, you know, no interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Thank you for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| I'm going to ask Commissioner Brown for a brief remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Commissioner Shouse brought up a question about Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| And I have the answer to his question as far as why is nothing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| And this goes to what Mr. Napier and Mr. Osborne both mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| the fact that it does take time to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| Some of us were there when we broke ground over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Well, the reason there's nobody in there is because just two-and-a-half months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| they opened it up for the first piece to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| So that's why there's nobody in that one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| We have 85 acres in that one out of that 230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| So just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| That's why we're not in there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| I want to say that, Todd, you and I were both at the Brownfields Conference last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| And I don't think there was anybody else in this area that went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| But I learned a lot at that conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| And one of the things that I took away from it coming back was that I wanted to work as hard as I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| to make sure that Knox County redevelops its brownfields and its grayfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| It was shown at that conference that you can redevelop these brown and grayfields cost-effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5369)|
| 1:29:38| and market them and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| And that I just could not, going forward, support any plan that eats up this much greenfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| I just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| I don't think it's the right thing for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I don't think it's the right thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| The online survey was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| And respectfully, I can't put any weight on that in this argument because it's far too easy to manipulate an online survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:14| if you've got a good communication circle and can get people motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| Especially, I feel like if the alternate plan site had, did it have its own survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| I mean, if it did, it probably would have had the opposite numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I just can't put any weight on that argument at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| I do feel like this type of business model is outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| And I think that it's much more profitable for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| It creates a much more stable economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| If we could work towards developing our local small businesses where more of the money that's generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| stays in our community instead of being sent out to the corporate headquarters in Fargo or Sacramento or wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:06| the money for local businesses, small businesses, stays here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| If a small business that only employs 30 people goes under, it doesn't create the economic devastation that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:18| when a 2,000-employee company goes under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| I'm sure we can all remember what happened with Levi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I feel like we need to do more as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| and as the development corporation in the chamber to support our small local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| and to really support our local entrepreneurs who are focused on these fields of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:49| I feel like we in the second district, we have the 275 corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| the brownfield that we were discussing, Baxter Avenue, that's in actually since the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| I think it's actually in Sam's district now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| But I drive that road every day, taking my child, going to pick up my child from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| And the kind of brownfield redevelopment and economic development that I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| and that I think you all would like to see also is we want that along the 275 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:25| We want light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| We want good jobs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| And I would like to see a little more emphasis put on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| We would welcome that kind of development in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| And we have available property there for small local businesses in support of our local entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| So I support Commissioner Wright's position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| I think it's the right thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| And moving ahead, I hope that we will make more of an effort to focus on healthier ways to grow our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5577)|
| 1:33:05| rather than trying to attract great big giant businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| I think we need to be doing, focusing more of our attention on local small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| and our local entrepreneurs because that's going to create the most stable, profitable economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| And it will have the best return for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:35| We have Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| And then I think we'll be ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| This is, strangely enough, in all the years that this has been a topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| this is really about the only time I've heard us be able to discuss it in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| And so it's a very healthy thing to hear these perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| I greatly, as a former member of the development corporation, just ex officio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| you know, at first I was in favor of the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| I really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| And sort of that comes down from sort of just years of absorption of the topic of business parks and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:19| You know, just in the last year, I'd say I've become less convinced that this business model is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:31| this 30 to 40-year-old business model of business park is really something that's healthy for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| Now, that's a matter of perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| And I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| But when I think about us and I think about Knox County, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| I certainly have a, you know, kind of a bird's eye view of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| And one is when I look around, and this is no slide on the MPC or on planning staff or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5694)|
| 1:35:04| but there's certainly a lot of exits that I've characterized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| They're just suffocatingly commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| When I think about East Knox County, I think about just, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| I mean, it's just an absolute breath of fresh air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| It's an amazing place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| And so when planners come up with sector plans, you know, there's lots and lots of stuff that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:37| And I understand the, you know, there's got to be places for these different types of zones and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:47| But when I think about East Knox and the French Broad River Corridor study and just the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| I'm going, this is not a logical conclusion for this land to be in a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| There's, but that's my perspective again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I've been labeled a couple of things around here, you know, tree hugger and green republican and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| While we're discussing, there's something that's very, that I greatly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| I greatly appreciate Dr. Briggs and Brad and their perspective, Todd and Rhonda and Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:31| And I've heard them, you know, and I've heard the rationales and I understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| And I hope we're right when we make this vote, you know, and we come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| I hope it's the right thing and the best thing for Knox County, no matter how it turns out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| Because I certainly could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| I greatly appreciate when I think about finances, I'm real glad that guy right over there went before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:59| Because I was really waiting to hear what Ed had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| And his trepidation somewhat with the model and how it represents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| whether it's able to do what it's proposed to do gives me a little greater level of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| So that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| I guess the only other aspect of growth and financial, you know, the overused word of sustainability is always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:32| And when I think about Knox County, I don't think of, I mean, growth, I think about regional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| I don't, I think about Oak Ridge National Labs and their 25,000 acres of land out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| that they're actively trying to market and Blount County and their park that's empty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| and not counting all our parks, which are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| But so all these things, we're regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| We're not, this isn't a Knox County issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| This is a regional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| And I think when we think that way also and realize the value of East Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:13| it just makes sense to not go with the park for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| I guess there are pros and cons of being first in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| You get to make your statement and then you get to listen to what everybody else has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| And three things that I've heard talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| We've talked about brownfields and development in internal 275 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| Well, the 275 corridor, which is a great, great place to locate a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| has, and I hope I get this name right, Grandview Ameristeel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| that the city invested millions of dollars in to bring jobs to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| Very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Ed, I think you were part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Cisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Guess who owns Cisco property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| The city developed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Well, they didn't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| They overtook it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Kind of like, you know, we talk about Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Chattanooga took an old military arms base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| and with the help of the federal government, the state government, the local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| sunk a lot of money into it, had vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| and now they've got 4,000 or 5,000 jobs waiting on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| So the city has sunk money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| And I say sunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| It sounds negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| The city has invested money in the Cisco property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| and the steel mill, which used to run Lonsdale, I believe, back in the 40s and 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| used to pretty much employ everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| They've been reinvested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| So they have had that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| And if they didn't have that vision 10, 15 years ago, that would still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| they actually, if you're not familiar with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| they took city blocks and closed them for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| City blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Blocked off streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| They blocked off access streets for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| I think the city invested $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Does that sound about right, Ed, or is it less than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| I think it's high 20s, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| It's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Let's say $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| So we've invested $20 million in that one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| Cisco, the city had to clean it up twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| And so we talk about these brown gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| I would love to see the old Zares building and the old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| that's not Standard & Ending Mills, it's Palm Beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I'd love to see those buildings redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| But that's going to take city dollars to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Somebody's going to have to have a vision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| Here's what we're going to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Those of you that are opposed to this, here's another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| The last exit in Knoxville that hasn't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| The federal government did not develop exits to get you to your house faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| They developed exits for interstate commerce and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| And so, you know, it's the same thing with Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| Turkey Creek, Level Road and Campbell Station was the last pretty exits on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| They're beautiful still and they're drawing in $12 million a year to your school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| Here's what's going to happen with the no vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| We're going to continue to see Clinton, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| who invested millions of dollars into Parks, Rhone County, Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:40| They're going to continue to get those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| And if you're okay with that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| I'm not okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I am sick and tired, and they're all our neighbors, but I'm sick and tired of losing to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| You know, if we had a vision, Chattanooga is soon to pass us economically and population-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6115)|
| 1:42:04| And I think part of that has to do with somebody 25 years ago had a vision in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| to redevelop the riverfront and to put the Tennessee Aquarium there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| We had that opportunity, but Knoxville passed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| We talked about the things that we have passed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| We had the opportunity to get that aquarium, from my understanding, 25 or 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| and we passed on it because we didn't think it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| A no vote for this is telling business we don't want you, and that's sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| Because a no vote in telling business that we don't want you is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| increased property taxes, and number two, urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| You talk about urban sprawl, now Knox County residents will be driving to sister counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| If you go to Pellissippi Parkway between the hours of 7 in the morning and 8.15 every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| and between however long it takes you to get from the government facilities out there at 4 or 4.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:08| you can't get off Pellissippi at 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| It's because all the Knox County residents are driving to Oak Ridge to work and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| And I love Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| They provide a wealth of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| But Knox County needs to think a little bit locally sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| and accept some good, proper business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| We've said no too long, and we're going to be, if you're sitting still, you're going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| And that's where we're at with the no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:47| Here is the motion on the floor is to approve the request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:59| to adopt the amended East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| So a vote in favor would affirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| A vote against, of course, would be against adopting the amended East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| But I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| I was asking this of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Should this be voted negatively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| In other words, if the no votes prevail, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| is it my understanding that at that point it will be up to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| to come up with a plan for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| Yes, essentially, sir, you'd be crafting an amended plan to send back to MPC for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| So we would have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| I mean, it would be up to this commission to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| I want to make sure that everyone understands the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| And after the vote, I will have a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| So, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| I guess I still don't understand the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| I'm trying to understand if we've incorporated, did we incorporate commissioner rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| So we never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| We're only voting on what was presented and presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Roll call vote, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| I've been painfully quiet on this, so I struggle mightily with this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:20| But I'm going to have to vote in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:30| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Commissioner Broyles votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=6337)|

| 2:15:05| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr. We are the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| We started this process back in the summer, so I would like to go ahead, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| Yes, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| This matter came before you all in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| You all sent it back to review a change to the sector plan to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| They had three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| They could recommend a change, they could recommend against a change, or they could recommend no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:44| They voted 6-6 on the change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Since that was a tie vote, they then sent it back here without any recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| They did recommend 7-5, though, that the zoning be changed, if you all change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| to rural commercial with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| One, that a development plan must be approved by MPC before any dirt can be disturbed out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:11| which is different than what it is with agriculture because it is a largely unrestrained zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| And second, that the applicant provide a traffic study and submit it to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| We ask you to approve, and we think you can approve, because although the zone has not been changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| there is an existing commercial use immediately adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| which the plan doesn't even recognize, although it is an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| The boat marina is clearly a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| They sell gasoline there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| They sell boats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| They service boats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| They used to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| I don't know whether they still do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| But anyway, Chad Kennedy in just a moment is going to speak to the merits of what he is proposing for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8214)|
| 2:17:03| But we seem to have had most of the discussion on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| And I think state law mandates plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| Our zoning ordinance mandates plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| And they need to be we need to plan all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| But I would remind you, and you all in the military who have been in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| know that in peacetime or if you're not in a war zone, all you do in the Army is train and plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| But General Eisenhower said that's the mandate of the peacetime Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8252)|
| 2:17:38| But once you come to war, don't let your hands be tied by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:45| And once you come up with a good proposal for a use of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| I suggest you as the legislative body and the policymaking body of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| should not let your hands be tied by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| You can initiate clearly a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| And a change is certainly justified by the nonrecognition of the existing plan of the boat marina right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:11| I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| The family is here that owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| They will be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| Chad, we're limited in time, so speak fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| My name is Chad Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| I live at 4185 Tawanda Trail, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| I'm the applicant for 1104 Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| I'm asking you, the Knox County Commissioners, to uphold MPC's approval to rezone this property to commercial rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| I'm also asking you to change the sector plan for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| On September 27, 2010, this legislative body voted 6-5 in favor of initiating your own sector plan change for my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:45| You also asked MPC to re-vote on the zoning of my property from agricultural to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| On November 10, 2010, MPC voted 7-5 in favor of rezoning my property from ag to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| MPC also voted 6-6 on changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| They then re-voted to take no action on changing the sector plan, essentially leaving the initiated sector plan change up to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:09| At my original MPC meeting, I was denied on both requests by a unanimous 13-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| Thankfully, because of your recommendation, MPC Commissioners took a closer look at my project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| and all the restrictive issues my land has on it and voted to agree with County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| and that the land should be rezoned to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I am very pleased with MPC's ruling on my rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| It further shows that our MPC Commissioners and Knox County Commissioners are on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| and are serious about giving our citizens the jobs they need, growing our economy, and pulling our community out of the recession we are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| Since my last County Commission meeting, I have continued to work with opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| I have tried to address their concerns and objections with my project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| Unfortunately, they are still unsatisfied with my offerings to alleviate their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| However, if Commission approves my request tonight, I pledge to still work with the leader of Tanrera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:58| and the residents on Fox Road to make this restaurant a good neighbor, and I will also work with them to make Fox Road safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| In my opinion, the final three issues my opposition has with my project is, first, the safety of Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| Second, is changing the sector plan even legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| And third, if my property is zoned rural commercial, then it is likely the two remaining parcels will be rezoned rural commercial also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:20| First, I believe the real problem with Fox Road is that drivers drive it too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| This problem can be solved by adding more speed limit signs, more policing, and the installation of speed bump strips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| I am personally willing to help pay for the speed limit signs and strips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Since there are currently no plans to widen Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| these three additions are the cheapest and quickest way to slow drivers down and make Fox Road safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| I also have plans to add a turning lane in front of my restaurant, allowing drivers a safer entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| I am willing to pay 100 percent of the cost for the Fox Road turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| Also, at my expense, I am working with TDOT and Norfolk Southern Railroad to install crossing arms at the Canton Hollow Railroad crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:57| Second, according to Tennessee Code Annotated 13.3-304,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| this legislative body has the full authority to change the sector plan for my property, and, therefore, your actions would be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| Third, there will be two parcels remaining if I buy my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| Only one of the two parcels is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| The sales price of this parcel is nearly $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| This price tag eliminates any chance for a sustainable commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| In my opinion, the parcel's most practical use is for single or multiple residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| According to Tom Pettit, the family's realtor, who is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| he has only received inquiries for residential use and no inquiries for any more commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| Finally, the sector plan for this property is just that, a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| In life, business, and in government, plans always get changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| A lot of times what we plan for the future is not right and we must change our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| The low density residential sector plan for this property is wrong for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| First, you cannot comfortably fit one to six homes on this site due to the many easements and setbacks on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8514)|
| 2:22:01| Second, when MPC approved a neighboring marina and its four-story warehouse to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| they made my property a very undesirable piece of land for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| My property's neighbor is a marina with 250 boat slips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| It is an operating commercial business with a boat and engine repair shop on site that creates loud noises throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:21| However, according to Tanrera's Homeowners Association's latest published newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| the neighborhood feels that the marina has been a good neighbor to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| You have the full and legal authority to change this sector plan to help my development to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| You will be giving Knox County citizens nearly 200 jobs that they need now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| You will also be increasing Knox County's property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| Please keep my final points in mind when you vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| Almost every newly elected Knoxville city and county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| and almost every candidate in the midterm election ran on creating jobs for our county and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| Both Mayor Tim Burchett and Governor-Elect Bill Haslam campaigned on creating jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| I ask you to help them deliver on their promise by voting yes to change this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| and yes to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| Yes, I gave him about seven and a half minutes, so I'll make sure the other folks get their allotted time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| I think we may need to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| The Planning Commission did not ñ it was not a clear recommendation for rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:22| It was based on whether or not you all, if you approved the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| then they would recommend rural commercial with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| I think it's a stretch to say the Planning Commission made a clear recommendation to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| They really can't do that because there was no action taken on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| So I think to be clear, it was not a clear recommendation to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:54| It was based solely on if the sector plan amendment is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| So I think that needs to be cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| Those who would be opposed to this, you have about seven and a half, eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, my name is Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| I'm from the law firm of Hodges, Duddee & Carson here at 617 Main Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| And I represent many of the residents that live in the area that will be impacted by this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| if the requests are approved by this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| That includes the Tanrera Oeste subdivision and its residents, Lovell Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| residents of Fox Road, individual residents on the road, residents of Canton Hollow Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| the members of the Lakeview Missionary Baptist Church, which is less than a half mile on Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| close to this applicant's property, and the Greenway School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| which is, aside from the residential nature of this entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| the only other places beside the Fox Road Marina, which, by the way, was grandfathered in as a commercial establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8695)|
| 2:25:03| are the school and the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| And so to show you the area that we're talking about, this is the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8705)|
| 2:25:16| Over here we have Canton Hollow Road that comes down and Fox Road meets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| Your property here of your applicant is right there, where my red pointer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| All of this area that's shaded green and yellow is all low-density residential because of the Southwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8729)|
| 2:25:38| This orange is residential as well. It's medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| So you have in the Southwest Sector Plan, if you put up the other map, I think we can all see it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| I don't want to take too much time, but the other map is the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| Here again is the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| All of these small indentations indicate a residence. It's all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8754)|
| 2:26:03| And your Southwest Sector Land Use Plan calls for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| And what I heard before I stood up here this evening is some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8770)|
| 2:26:17| In order for this body to change its land use plan, you have to determine that that property right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:25| should not be part of this entire Southwest Sector Plan, which is designated low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:33| And frankly, to put a sector plan change right there where you've got this entire area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8793)|
| 2:26:42| as low-density and medium-density residential is improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| It's not an appropriate sector plan change, and it doesn't meet the criteria of the law to change a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8807)|
| 2:26:57| What conditions must be met in order to change a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8817)|
| 2:27:05| And with all due respect, Commissioner Wright, the law says you've got a sector plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| This is not the Midway problem. You already approved the Southwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| You already approved the land use plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| You approved the Southwest Sector Plan. It is your legislative enactment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| And as your legislative enactment, you said this area should be residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| You must have, according to Tennessee law, either a new road or utility improvements, an error or omission in the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8854)|
| 2:27:44| changes in government policy, change in development, population or traffic trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:50| None of that exists to change the sector plan on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| In fact, the traffic patterns have gotten worse so bad in going through this narrow 18-foot wide road that has no shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8877)|
| 2:28:08| that has a railroad right next to it and houses on the other side, that it's getting more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:14| And so I submit and will submit with this record the 911 calls and a synopsis and a highlighted version for your edification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:24| that have occurred since 2004 up until October of this year to show the increase in traffic hazards and the related calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| including traffic accidents, deaths and other property damage to the residents out here as a result of motor vehicle accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:47| You get to this property by coming down from Kingston Pike, either on Canton Hollow Road or Fox Road or from Westland Drive through Emory Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:57| That's the way you get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| In order to get down into this area, you have to traverse all of those residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| And that's a good reason not to change your southwest sector plan and place a commercial and potentially a corridor of commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:15| at the bottom of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| Your role first is to decide whether the sector plan should be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:25| If you change the sector plan, then you can talk about rezoning and then with all due respect to Mr. Kennedy's application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8965)|
| 2:29:32| you can talk about putting a restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| But the first and primary and important thing you have to decide on is whether you're going to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:43| And it's not the same as a zoning plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| Zoning and planning are complementary pursuits that are largely concerned with the same subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| but they're not identical fields of land use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| Planning involves coordinating the orderly development of all interrelated aspects of a community's physical environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| as well as all the community's closely associated social and economic activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| Zoning, on the other hand, involves the territorial division of land into districts according to the character of the land and buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:19| their suitability for particular uses, and the uniformity of these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| The state enabling legislation places the primary authority to plan with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:32| But in 2008, there was an amendment to that statute, and it said if you have a reason to change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:41| even after the MPC has said don't do it, it's not appropriate, then you have the option of initiating a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:51| That's what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| You sent it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| You said look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| And when MPC sent it back to you, the staff said essentially the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| Don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| It's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| It's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| It's not an appropriate change for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| Mr. Kline, you have a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| So this site does not meet any of the criteria for a change of the sector plan, and this request is not about spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9075)|
| 2:31:27| It's a request for a spot sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| So if you change the sector plan amendment, you would have to have a good reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| and it would have to be one of the four reasons it would have to meet the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| You don't have those requirements met here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| With all due respect, Commissioner Wright, you can't do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| If you did it, then we would talk about requirements for rezoning, because only after the sector plan is changed can you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:57| the need based on substantially changed or changing conditions in the area or in the county generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| You also don't have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| So with all due respect, don't do anything illegal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| Don't change your sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| It would be inappropriate for this area and for this particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| Mr. Seymour, you have three minutes rebuttal, and then we'll give Mr. Kline three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| Mr. Kline reads a lot into the Tennessee code that is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| The statute merely says the general regional plan may be amended upon the initiative of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9148)|
| 2:32:35| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| That initiative is then transmitted to the MPC, which considers it and can either approve, deny, or take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:46| which they did in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| The sector plan can be changed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| There are two zones in the county, neighborhood commercial and rural commercial, that are designed for sites like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9174)|
| 2:33:03| We are asking for rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| It is to be in an area where there is no other commercial zoning available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| And you've got to change the sector plan before you can enact rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| That's all we're asking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| It's perfectly within the purview of this body to do what we are asking you to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| The sector plan simply does not recognize what already exists on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9205)|
| 2:33:32| Mr. Kennedy, do you want to add anything else to what I may be speaking here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| It's awfully easy to say no, but commercial will not kill this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| Commercial will enhance this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| If Mr. Kennedy gets to build his restaurant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| the customers will come out of the surrounding subdivisions because that's what he's wanting to do, a neighborhood restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9232)|
| 2:34:00| You have seen his plans with sort of a park there along the lake, something that will be attractive for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:08| The traffic is there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| The statistics they're talking about are there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| Traffic will be coming from the local area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| It's a matter of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| Fox Road is fine if people obey the law or if there's some enforcement out there to get them to obey the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9257)|
| 2:34:25| They get boats up and down Fox Road already from either Emory Church Road, Canton Hollow Road, or Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9265)|
| 2:34:35| We submit that this is a perfect use for this property to enhance the value of the waterfront to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9275)|
| 2:34:44| and we ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| Let me quote your Knoxville, Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission plan amendment rezoning report on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| The site does not meet any of the criteria of the Knoxville, Knox County General Plan 2032 for changes of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:09| warranting amendment of the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| The request is a spot sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| This is not an appropriate place to change the sector plan, and with all due respect to the request, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9316)|
| 2:35:24| we would request that your motion stand and that this commission deny a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| If, in fact, the sector plan change is amended, I would like time to talk about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9330)|
| 2:35:39| because the zoning shouldn't be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| But that's not what this first vote is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Please deny a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| It's not good for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| It's an illegal act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| You had mentioned a 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| And were there statistics that you wanted to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| It's okay, I wanted to ask him that question, because you said there was a 9-1-1 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| What we did was we asked 9-1-1 for a listing of all the calls, and we got a listing of all the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9365)|
| 2:36:11| We then highlighted all the calls from 9-1-1 that either came from Canton Hollow Road, Fox Road, or West Emory Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9371)|
| 2:36:20| And we see over time that the number have increased and the number of fatalities and accidents have also increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| And I'm going to show you that through the provision of an exhibit that is quite lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| and I have it in my briefcase, but it has a highlighted version of every 9-1-1 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| It's about that thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| Mr. Seymour, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| I want to give you an opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| I have not seen what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| Mr. McHenry, who represents property owners, wanted to say a word if he may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| Hello, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| I'm Chris McHenry, though I currently reside in Los Angeles, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| I represent my parents, Joe and Dot McHenry, who have the property for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| And I would also like to state the immediate neighbor of the restaurant-proposed property is my sister-in-law, Betsy McHenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9426)|
| 2:37:15| Due to health reasons, she's not able to be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| But I do want to stress that the immediate neighbor of this property is very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:25| and welcomes the potential of having a restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| And we have worked or we have not worked with them, but we have seen the proposed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| I grew up in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9454)|
| 2:37:35| We bought the property in 1968, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| And the community is still very close to all of our hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| and we want to be sure that as we go on that there's going to be something great there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| And as was stated, the property in question has a four-story building built right on the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9468)|
| 2:37:58| that was approved by county commission several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9478)|
| 2:38:01| and it's just made it no one has wanted the property for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| And, again, the McHenrys are very much in favor of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| I want to make sure that I'm fair to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| Do you want to respond to anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| You have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| This request for a sector plan change has been a process of singling out a particular parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area for the benefit of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:32| And this request constitutes the very antithesis of plan zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| The sector plan change would create an island of commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| that is unjustifiably different from all of the surrounding land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| And I showed you on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| And it would be an illegal act to put a rural commercial zone in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9526)|
| 2:38:51| This is not about Chad Kennedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| It is not about the McHenry property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| It's about a sector plan change that's inconsistent with what this body has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| should be the appropriate nature of the development and the land use in this southwest sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| and that is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| Mr. Law Director, the question that I raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9553)|
| 2:39:23| and then rephrased in maybe some ineloquent terms about the power or the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9563)|
| 2:39:32| that is reposed here in this room to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9572)|
| 2:39:41| I believe I've heard two or three different interpretations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| of the ability of county commission to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:52| Can county commission change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| And can we initiate to MPC a change in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9596)|
| 2:40:02| Yes, that's what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| The argument that the council has made for the property owners who are opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| he's saying that it's an impermissible change because it constitutes essentially singling out a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| Normally you would call that spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Here you'd call it spot sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| Yeah, but let me back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| I'm not speaking to the issue that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| I believe I said that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| I'm not speaking to the issue that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| Is it appropriate for county commission to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| Yes, but that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| If there's an application to change a sector plan, yes, you're empowered to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| Let me ask a question that you can answer yes or no to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| Can we change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| I didn't mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| There are no caveats in the legal world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| This has nothing to do with Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9654)|
| 2:41:01| I truly need to be informed because we have had this back and forth on both of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:09| Can commission initiate a sector plan change and then approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:18| Yes, that's what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| I can drive my car 120 miles an hour, too, but it's against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| Give me a minute on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I thought he was going to ask me if I was a Republican or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| That yes or no question was kind of ñ I didn't see that coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| So I understand the dialogue that we've been having, but let me ask the professionals a hard question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9698)|
| 2:41:50| that they may not want to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| Is this a situation where we're asking for spot sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9713)|
| 2:42:04| One word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| I want to bring up just a couple of points before we vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| because I think there's something that we need to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| because this has much bigger implications as to whether the restaurant is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| Because once we change the sector plan there is where we're ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| what this is ultimately leading to is a rural commercial zoning so the restaurant can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9749)|
| 2:42:35| First of all, I think it's important to note that that marina that was already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| didn't have to be approved by the county commission because it was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| That could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| If I'm incorrect, someone please correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| But that marina could be built under the agricultural zoning that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| The second thing I wanted to bring up is a bigger issue about what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| when we change the sector plan and we change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| And this has nothing to do with the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| It means what happens to that land after it's changed to a rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:10| It doesn't mean a restaurant even has to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| It doesn't mean a restaurant has to be built on the property next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| And if the property next to it makes the same application as this for rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| which, quite frankly, would make sense to do, there's no reason for that not to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| These are some of the ñ I'm not going to read all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| I bet there's 50 things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| There's two pages of what can be built on rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| But I'm just going to highlight what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| And, you know, for some reason that Mr. Kennedy's financing doesn't come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| or the property next to it is rezoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| Here's some of the things that can be put on this little island right in the middle of a neighborhood with poor roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| Grocery stores, fueling stations with or without convenience stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| small appliance stores, sporting goods stores, hardware, fabric and upholstery shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9836)|
| 2:44:03| video sales and rentals, laundromats, equipment rental, exercise fitness centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:10| veterinarian clinics, commercial telecommunication towers, and then there's some limitations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:17| And then uses permitted on review include dog kennels and animal boarding facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| All of these things, we don't say that we're going to allow you to build a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| What we say is that we're going to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| And the things that I just mentioned and all of these things are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| Now let me tell you, and I'm going to paraphrase this just slightly, from spot zoning to spot sector plan changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:45| And I'm going to read this directly because this has a legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| And the term spot zoning or spot sector plan changes used by MPC and attorneys is best defined as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9889)|
| 2:44:58| the process of singling out a small parcel of land for use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| totally different from that of the surrounding area for the benefit of the owner of such property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| and to the detriment of other owners and as such is the very antithesis of plan zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:22| Now, what we're really voting on tonight is not about whether we think the restaurant's a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| I've talked to Chad several times on the phone. I've been out there with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| I mean, he's got good ideas. He's a very impressive, and I can say this at my age, very impressive young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| And I think he's a good business as he has successful restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| The question is not about the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| It's do we want to change the zoning of this land so any of these things that I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:49| can be built out there in the middle of a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| For that reason, I think we need to deny the sector plan change tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:59| because if we approve the sector plan change, we're basically approving a spot zoning change also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| because that's where it's all leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| Thank you. I'm going to back into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| The section you just read, the first phrase was MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9970)|
| 2:46:18| From a legal standpoint, that was the first part I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| The term spot zoning used by MPC and attorneys is best defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| MPC attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| No, not MPC attorneys. MPC and attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| And that's the legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| This isn't an MPC term. This is a legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| And this has nothing to do with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| I'm just straining at then following up what applies to the MPC about spot zoning or spot sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:53| Commissioner McKenzie, your question was of MPC, this is spot sector plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10013)|
| 2:47:01| Yeah, does this constitute that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| And the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| But the action of commission can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| We did it with North Shore and Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| That was one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| Went to commercial zoning just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10045)|
| 2:47:30| The commission has the authority to change the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| but the plan lays out the criteria by which you have to meet in order to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| I guess that's what I'm straining at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| I'm going to let it rest now because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10063)|
| 2:47:50| The motion on the floor is to deny the sector plan amendment from LDR to RC rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10070)|
| 2:48:00| All those in favor of the denial say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| We need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| First issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| It's always first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| Tank used to go to the ninth every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10093)|
| 2:48:19| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| He doesn't want to start with the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| We'll go with the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| Well, let's go with the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| We're certainly not going to start with the 10th, I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| The 10th comes real quick after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| So the motion, Dr. Briggs, is to deny the sector plan, which would not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| Essentially it's per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| So motion four is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| That was your motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| Vote yes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| Deny the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| You're not really going to get to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part2?start=10132)|
