| 0:01:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| So we are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| And everyone, please keep Commissioner Daly in your thoughts and prayers as he recovers from his knee infection and the surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| Next, I'd like to ask Commissioner Larson Jay to begin the evening with tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| We'll be praying for you and your fashion choices as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| I duly apologize for my outfit and do not hope that that distracts from the Christmas spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| But if you can't laugh at yourself at this point of the year, when can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| I'm thrilled tonight to ask my friend, often my advisor and a wonderful member of our community, to join us for this devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=138)|
| 0:02:29| the Reverend Cannon Michelle Warner-Bolt from the Episcopal Diocese of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Thank you for the opportunity, Commissioner Jay, to speak before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| As our days shorten and the nights lengthen and the ground begins to shake and quake in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=169)|
| 0:02:59| we remember that many of our faith communities gather around the light that shines in the darkness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=179)|
| 0:03:08| In my own Christian tradition, next week we will gather to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| and to remember the scriptures that say a light shines in the darkness and the darkness cannot overcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| And yet, for many of us, it will be the first holiday that we face after the loss of a friend or a loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| Or we may have friends or loved ones, like the own Commissioner Daley, who are in the hospital and can't be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| There might be empty seats at our tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| If we look to our friends who are our first responders and police officers, doctors and nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| they will tell us that next week will be a busy one because for those who are battling with mental illness or drug or alcohol addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=230)|
| 0:04:00| their Christmases may not be red or green or silver and gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| They'll be facing a blue Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| And so I invite you now to think about someone in your lives who might be facing a difficult week next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| for whom it may not be the most wonderful time of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| and consider how you might be called to bring a little joy, light, life or love to those people in our communities next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=261)|
| 0:04:32| And I'd like to close with some words that are some of the oldest words in the Christian tradition recorded as prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| From St. Augustine of Hippo, that's to whom these words are attributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And it is a prayer and if you are so inclined, I invite you to pray with me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work or watch or weep this night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| and give your angels charge over those who sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Tend the sick, Lord Christ, give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| pity the afflicted and shield the joyous and all for your love's sake. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you, Commissioner Jay, for bringing her for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Next, I'd like to ask my fellow commissioner, Commissioner Carringer, to lead us in a pledge of allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you so much for that devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| And before we stand and salute our nation's flag, I want us all to remember our veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| and those who won't be home for Christmas with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| And because of the sacrifice that they've all made is why we're able to be here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| and why we are able to celebrate this Christmas season, the birth of our Savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| So please remember those families who've lost loved ones while fighting for our freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| and that we do live in the greatest country because we are free to worship and go about our daily needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=373)|
| 0:06:23| So I would ask that you would please salute our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=394)|
| 0:06:50| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| As we begin to go through our agenda, we're at the point of our agenda where we invite members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| if you'd like to address the commission, to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| However, before I begin that, I do want to thank and recognize some of our other specific elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| and other honorees that we may have joining us in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| First, I've noticed Mayor Jacobs is here on the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you, Mayor. If you've got anything you'd like to share with the commission, it's a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And thank you to all of his direct reports who I've noticed are sitting in the front to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| I've also noticed that Sheriff Spangler is here as well in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Sheriff Spangler, thank you for joining us again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| We also have Super Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Bob Thomas is the superintendent of our school system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| And if there are any other elected officials or folks...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| Okay. Charlie Susano is here as well. I saw Charlie last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Charlie, I'm sorry. I did not recognize you sooner, and you're sitting right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| And I went to elementary school with you as well, so once again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So thank you, Charlie, for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Is there anyone else? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Okay. Well, thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| We did not have before this meeting any members of the public contact the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| in order to speak at county commission this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| So what I'd like to do is ask the audience if there are any folks who have come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| to address county commission, and through that, addressing your local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| If anyone's here, you are welcome to approach the podium right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| state your name and address for the record, and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Seeing none, we will move on to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| The very first thing on our agenda, it's a pleasure for someone who has recently served with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| for county commission to recognize David Shields for his service on the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Madam Clerk, I'm going to go ahead and jump right into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So David, tell you what, and everyone, David is one of those community volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| who a few years ago was tasked by the local CPA community to serve on the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| That is a very important job, often thankless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| It requires a lot of prep, a lot of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| and he has done it admirably for the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| and most recently had actually served as the chair of our audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| So he has rotated out of that service, and it's our pleasure to recognize him tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| So David, if you would please meet me at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| I'm going to go ahead and read this into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Then I'll even give you a chance to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| So at this time, I will need a motion from one of the members of commission to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| So the motion has come from Commissioner Schoonmaker and has been seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| So all in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| All right, it passes, so now we can officially recognize you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=599)|
| 0:10:14| Who else is on the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Just those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| That all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I thought they thought more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I'll go ahead and just read this into the record, and then we'll get a nice picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Jim, come on down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Oh, Jim's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| All right, once again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Okay, whereas David Shields' term on the Knox County Audit Committee recently expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| and whereas David Shields was appointed to the audit committee by the commission in September 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=643)|

| 0:22:32| this program. This is our very strong senior class that you see here. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| couple guys playing some other sports, and to be honest with you, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| underclassmen are in the weight room right now maxing out for next season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| because we're trying to repeat, so be careful for that. But yeah, I just can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| say enough about all the hard work and dedication these guys have put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Like I said, they've been with me ever since the beginning. We've laid a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| good foundation for them of being very strong student-athletes, student first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and athlete second. They've done an unbelievable job keeping up our team GPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| holding us down on the community service aspect, and you know, I always tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| if we take care of things off the field, they'll take care of things on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| And you saw that two weeks ago. You saw us go down to Cookville, wait all day for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| a 7 o'clock Central time kickoff, stay in the locker room for six hours only to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| get back on the bus and come back home and turn back around eight hours later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and do it again. We can honestly say we're the first state championship team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| to win a state championship on Sunday. Usually NFL players play on that day, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| now we hold another little record of our own. We could throw that in there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| But definitely just very excited. You know, it's a good time for these guys. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| glad they get a chance to see this. We definitely appreciate everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| recognizing and seeing the hard work that goes into it. And last but not least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| we're definitely happy to bring back a state championship for Knox County. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| Would you like to say something? Okay, and I also ask Superintendent Bob Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| what else can we say except wow, which is one of my favorite words. You spell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| frontwards and backwards and it still says wow. So thank you all so much. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| so proud of you. I can't wait to see the big state rings. Have we got them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| designed and all yet? Okay, so thank you all so much. We're so proud of you and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| look forward to seeing what you all achieve after Central High School. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| hope to see some of y'all up here one day in office. So if y'all don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| we'll come up here and get a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| Don't let her carry the trophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1491)|
| 0:25:21| There's actually nothing to discuss on this agenda, other than just the two public speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| We can talk for a while on the legislative issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| I mean, if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah, we've got the time to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Because we've got zonings at 7, that ain't going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| We can't leave it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Please give it due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| Minor little additions to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Just to talk about dates of the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| We'll talk about dates of the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Forensics and the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| I want to remind everybody of RSVP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| for the meeting with the legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Oh, do we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Because if you come early, you can get a breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I mean a ham biscuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| I'm probably going to go and waste that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| I'm going to go there for that to listen in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1579)|

| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1607)|
| 0:27:05| Once again, congratulations guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| We are now at the point on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| where the chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| to approve the meeting minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We have a motion from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Is that from Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| All the minutes look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| All in favor of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| We are now at the point on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| where we set and finalize our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| for the rest of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| I do want to point out a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| because these came up as discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| at the closing of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| We've got two pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| that we need to vote on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| that was very deeply discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| As we are going through both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| there is some discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| the first one was sent forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| with a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| The proper way to approve both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| is they are neither, if you'll notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| are on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| When we get to them on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| we will do a roll call vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| I just want to make that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| for all my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| as well as the interested parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Is that hopefully clear as it can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Two other amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| One, which Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| if you could add this on at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| as discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| about two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| we were working to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| a time this month to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| the Forensic Center, it being December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We were never able to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| an exact time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| When we get to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| I'll bring up a brief discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| about times that would work for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| and we can finalize it in the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| about a visit to the Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Secondly, when we discuss the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Stephanie has asked me to get RSVPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| from all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| specific if you're going to get there early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| related to breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| One discussion item regarding Forensic Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| and when we get to this legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| discussion, I will ask for RSVPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1763)|

| 0:29:33| work session is we do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| and it's in your printed agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| we do have one withdrawal and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1777)|

| 0:29:47| Otherwise, are there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| agenda items that the chair has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| missed or that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Seeing no lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I'd like to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| a motion for this to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=1799)|

| 0:46:16| clear, this has been frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Richie, I want to let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| our meeting is usually kind of like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| really, but we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| have a fairly light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| The main discussion item, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| do want to review and give some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| intentionality to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| we're going to ask our leaders in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| to focus on. I'll also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| ask, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| let Stephanie know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| how many folks are going to be there early for the breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| and how many total folks are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| I'm going to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Brad, you've got a light, but then I'll also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| ask Commissioner Schoonmaker to weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| in from the legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Go ahead, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Anderson. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| really a point of order on another matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| It is the Aslan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Foundation. I want the minutes to reflect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| because I think it's important for history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| to understand that request on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| road closure. It's Aslan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Aslan, like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| lion from the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I guess. It's A-S-L-A-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| That is where it comes from. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| named after the lion from the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| It's Aslan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Okay. It's a foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| established by Lindsey Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Commissioner Anderson, is that for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Okay. Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I'm going to go ahead and let you begin this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| on behalf of the legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| As we discussed in the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| session, myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| and Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| posted on the Knox County Forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Commissioner Christmas over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| posted some items regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I'll go ahead and just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| review the state issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| and then, Commissioner Anders, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| want to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| local issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| The items that were posted on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| agenda, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| on the forum were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| concerning TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| 67-4-409| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| which was the restoration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| the full 5% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| commission for the Register of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Deeds office, which we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| the presentation last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| week. Another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| is the TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| 67-6-7-10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| which is reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| administration fee charged by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| the Department of Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| from 1.125%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| to 0.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| post was for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| discussion about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| internet sales tax and the distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| to cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Commissioner, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| That sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| admin fee, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| want to just clarify, that was from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| 1.125% to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| half a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| 0.05%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Got it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| And that's a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Avenue, than what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| another item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| that was posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| happening in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| with the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| is that on state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| prisoners, once that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I always get the terms wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Once they're convicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| that we should be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| to collect the fee for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| a state prisoner instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| of now once it's finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| sentenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And that's a state issue. That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| we don't really, I mean, everybody's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| on board with that, so that's nothing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| necessarily we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| address with our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| But I just put that in there for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| Commissioner Andrews, you wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| the local items? Sure. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| we talked about the growth plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| whether or not we need a private act to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| fix the growth plan that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And also in dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| the planning commission, whatever their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| new acronym is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| planning commission structure and operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and maybe just seeking a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| giving us permission at the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| to restructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| and kind of study that over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| a little bit. Unfunded mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| I think we can all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| that those are, you know, I gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| an example of the PE instruction that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| required that caused us to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| 17 extra teachers last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| or a couple years ago. So some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| things that they need to look at. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| the funding of BEP and changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| You know, we keep bragging about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| an excess revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| from the state every year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| yet BEP is not fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| funded. So let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I think those are something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| as a body, I think we all agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| And I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| that the state, I mean, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| a donor county and we understand we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| because we're the hub of the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| East Tennessee and we get that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| let's be a little bit more fair with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| And then, Mr. Chairman, the other one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| we had discussed was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| auto liability insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| for counties raising the rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| from $15,000 to $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| to cover damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| vehicles when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| hit a county-owned vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I guess one point that I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| want to make is we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| to make sure that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| the things that we pick and do are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| drive incremental communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| to our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| The reason why I bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| up is I want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| John, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| worked with our Tennessee County Commission Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| deeply on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| How many of these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| we going to be seeing get pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| by the lobbyist for the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| County Commission Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| And how many of these do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| I guess, when we communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| are we going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| are we in support of some of these things that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| getting pushed by a Tennessee County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Kind of endorse that and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| partner in. I guess, as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| we need to decide, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| get that one-pager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| communication document, what's it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| going to look like? We endorse TCCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| we endorse our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| school partners in particular on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| items, and we endorse these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| three or four items that are specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| local in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| And that's kind of where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| so that we can get the most out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| I want to find out from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| if we get to that, have we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| accomplished our goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| John, I might ask you to weigh in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Are these going to be represented by TCCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| I think the restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| of the 5% for the Registered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Deeds Office will be pushed not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| from their association, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| other associations will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| So that will be covered statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| Also, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| sales tax administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| fee will also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| basically a statewide issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| from a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| organizations, from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| mayors, the county commissioners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| The one item that probably won't be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| radar will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| the recommendation from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Smith about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| auto liability insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| increase. That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| that I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| anybody's really thought through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| that and what a benefit that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| for counties in general across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| state. It's not just counties, it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| individuals. Well, yeah, but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| of course there's going to be a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| on the internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| And then also did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Jay, did you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| to mention the items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| as far as education? Kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Commissioner Christmas, better. You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Okay, well I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| in our last joint education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| you all were sent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| legislative priorities from the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Board of Education, and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| discussion was had about whether we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| find two or three things on their list that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| would also agree with that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| sort of show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| consensus and a sign of solidarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| between our two bodies. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| that the two that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| the three that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| the first one is local control of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| schools. That one may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| be debatable, but the second one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| one we've already mentioned, funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| public education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| fully funding the basic education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| the BEP. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| the third one is funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| of school nurse positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| for the health of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| One thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| that I might weigh in, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| want to make sure we don't have any unintended perceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| is, I'm just throwing this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| here for discussion, is if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| select their whole agenda, are we saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| we don't support some of these things? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| I know, I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| But I'm just, that's why I'm going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| We want to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| intentional and that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| just cherry pick a couple that are going to be a big thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| for us, which may be the ones that are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| fiscally related versus, say, policy related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| that, you know, it's clear also to our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| in the school board that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| pick a couple, we're not saying we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| against any of the others, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| also got to be, as we communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| with our legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| that we're clear that these are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| that are kind of in our wheelhouse a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| in commission and we really want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Well, I think what you said at the end is the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| sort of, these are things that we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| overlap in our goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| and intentions and that the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| items are very much in their lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| And these are in both our lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| And I think that those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| only three that seem to be in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Okay. Yeah, I've heard a wise man say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| stay in your lanes. Alright, I'm not sure when all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| lights came on. I'm going to recognize Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Smith, then Schoonmaker, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I just wanted Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| to repeat that list that he thought were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| in the wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| So one's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| One, two, and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| One, two, and four. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| read them in more detail if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Local control of schools, funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| public education, and funding of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| nurse positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| as it relates to health of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| I think if I were to pick two of the three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| I would pick funding for BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| and funding of the school nurse positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| as my top two, but that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| me personally. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| if we want to slim it down to two, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| those could be two to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Okay, I recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker's light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| and then I'll move to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just going to also mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| that several of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Knoxville delegation have already filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| bills this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| There's actually been ten bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| filed in the House, and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| since we've got a few minutes, if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| just have the privilege just to run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| these, just so you guys understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| where some of our legislators are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Actually, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| first bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| that was filed this year was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| from Representative Staples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| and what that does is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| authorizes sports betting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| in the state, only in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| jurisdictions that approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| by local referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| And then there's a 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| tax on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| sports bets, where then there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| division of, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| 40% goes to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| 30% goes to Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Colleges of Applied Technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| and community colleges, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| 30% to local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| for education and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So that was actually the first bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Bill number six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| is another one that's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| for, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Commissioner Anders, who's going to do the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| and criminal justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| What they're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| they don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| have somebody lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| their driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| so they can't then get to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| to be able to pay their fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| and court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| So they're trying to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| the state code to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| because of a driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| violation and things, you can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| incarcerated and then not be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| lose your license and that kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| So it's about a two-page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| And then some people might find this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| interesting. This was another bill by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Representative Staples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| and he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| actually asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| it's under the wine and wineries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| tab, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| it's an increase from three cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| of wine to six cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| of wine that a direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| shipper may sell and ship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| directly to an individual by common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| carrier in a calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| So I just thought that was kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| another bill, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| is specifically, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| address Knox County. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| House Bill Number 9. It authorizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Knox County and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| to prohibit by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| smoking on grounds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| any playground owned or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| operated by the local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But the way the bill is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| written, it's for entities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| have population in excess of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| 432,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| So that would only be the four big counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| was also, it's sponsored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| in the Senate by Senator Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| And then another thing I thought that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| find interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Representative Nicely, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| represents several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| counties, he has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Senate joint resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| to amend the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| so that the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| can never impose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| a property tax from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| state side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| So I thought that was kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Because we know that the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| counties and cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| can impose a property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Excuse me, did I say sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I meant to say property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I did? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| So this way it was stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| in 1949, but now he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| wants to make it a permanent thing where the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| can never impose a property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| on the citizens of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| of Tennessee. So that would be interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| to see how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| flows through. Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you. Commissioner Carringer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| light is on and then I will go to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Gill. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| So are we actually going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| decide tonight what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| That is our goal when we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| have enough time before zoning starts at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| So while I want everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| to kind of say their piece, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| as we get towards the end, I will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| kind of pushing this a little bit to kind of tighten up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| everything. But as I mentioned at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| we do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| walk out of this with a one page document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| that will be easy to communicate to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| legislators and in turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| easy for them to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| them about how they should vote. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| So with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| schools, did we narrow down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| what, were we going two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Has Larson, is that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Commissioner Christmas, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| kind of what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Two or three of the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Yeah, I believe there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| are three that I feel like are overlapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| If the body and the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| would like to narrow that to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I can probably get us there but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I serve on joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Do you have an opinion or the vice chair have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| The chair's opinion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| as we are the funding body, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| noticed quite obviously that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3730)|

| 1:02:14| are you, we've got anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| that's related to funding if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| in our wheelhouse that strikes me as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| that makes immediate sense for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| and I'm speaking not just as chair but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| the fourth district. Would everybody feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| if I actually read those three and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| give me a thumbs up or thumbs down after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| we go through it. Let's go with the easy one. Funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| public education. Knox County Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Education believes it is crucial to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| of our state and the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| invest more in public education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| fully fund the basic education program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| BEP. Thumbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I guess that's your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| sorry. That's alright. You do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| the thumbs up. Remember this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| discussion on a board document so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| have rules to apply to this but I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| for the sake of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| all commissioners in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| this particular item please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Aye. All opposed please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| say nay. Okay the ayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| have it. That one's on the list. Second item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| funding of school nurse positions. The Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Board of Education urges the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| to amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| BEP formula for school nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| to one nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| per 750 students based upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3800)|

| 1:03:32| for Disease Control CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| That's the one I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| wanted to speak out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| really need this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| big time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Knox County schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| it'd be nice if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| lower that per student but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| our teachers are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| counselors and teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| nurses and doctors and all that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| we definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| need that and also I mean in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| of medication and all that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| handed out to every student. And I think this is just lowering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| the ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| so that would be number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Sorry do you want to? That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| they'd have to I mean I'm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| favor we need to push for this and to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| more nurses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Knox County schools. Every school needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| one if we could possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Schools need nurses and this would cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| the funding for it so it would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| a unfunded mandate it would help us avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| So and I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| remind everyone Commissioner Carringer I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| call on you but I do as soon as we finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| this I'm going to move down my list to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Commissioner Gill and then Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| all in favor of adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| the funding of the school nurse positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| to our list please say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| aye. Aye. Opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| please say nay. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| the ayes have it that's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Commissioner do you want to go ahead over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| a third one? Do you want me to just do the third one and then I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| done with all the schools? Sure go right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| ahead. The third one is Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| of Education believes that local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| boards of education are best equipped and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| informed to make decisions to address the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| and challenges of their local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Board opposes any efforts to diminish or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| impede this local control. This is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| I was a little bit iffy with and I think maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| those who have more experience with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| school district would I don't know if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| you know I believe there's a role for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| as well as for the local so I wonder if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| somebody might want to weigh in on that before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Alright I'll kind of open this one up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| do your lights pertain to this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Mine does. Okay alright Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Well I guess really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| wanted to get a perspective I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| the more decisions we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| make on a local level are a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| but I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| the totality of that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| is and so it makes me a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| uneasy to put my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| name on that if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| something I mean we don't even know what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| really it's a pretty vague discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| item so as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I think the best decisions are made at your front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I don't know that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| as vague as that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I don't know that we can unanimously get behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| that because it may come up to something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| we don't really know what's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| and I think that's a dangerous precedent to set for us as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| commissioner. Speaking as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| commissioner as opposed to just as chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| my thoughts are we're the funding body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| and is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| I personally in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| as a commissioner is I'd like to keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| recommendations more towards funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| as these first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| are but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I'm saying that as commissioner not as a chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| trying to influence the board that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| personal opinion. And we do need to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| everybody that these are just discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| things these are not actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| votes or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| with that said go ahead commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| well I was just saying seeing that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| sort of nod their head I think that's I would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| we take that one off and just stick to the first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| okay and that would be the end of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| okay thank you I'm going to move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| thank you Mr. Chair and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| that these are discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| because I want to acknowledge that the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| system's resolution four days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| acknowledging vouchers as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4040)|

| 1:07:24| at the issue of funding since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| the funding body and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| impact of that let me first say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| that I will support the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| that the school system has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| acknowledged. Number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| what is critical to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| is that the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| to intervention program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| levels one levels two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| and level three is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| high unfunded mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| over and above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| those positions in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| of looking at physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| education for students at an elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| level. The level of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| response to intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| levels one levels two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| and level three have a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| impact upon teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| and the resources in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| they might not realize you're talking about RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| RTI and RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| has three levels in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| of the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| component associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| versus the funding component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| associated with elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4102)|

| 1:08:26| dedicated to physical education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| so I just need to make sure we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I'm going to ask you a clarifying question on that if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| okay because reading through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| and I'll go ahead and read what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| this does fall under the first word is funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| it says the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| urges the General Assembly to amend the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| formula to include funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| for response to instruction and intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| positions within the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| I'm asking this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| a dumb guy who doesn't know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| do we have some of these head counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| in our system that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| have been funding locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| or is this incremental head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| counts Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| I'm looking to you Randy and Evelyn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| are these things that would make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| for these positions to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| permanently part I mean I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| tell me a little bit where are we right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| in the funding and would this result in more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| folks doing it or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| sustainability and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| I'll let the commissioners address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| and then if you'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I see Tanya here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| so we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| one of our teacher friends here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| Tanya would you please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| if you could have some clarification on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Tanya Coates, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| President of the Knox County Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| so at this point you pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| because it's an unfunded mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| under Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Burchett he actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| had more funds put into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| budget to actually pay for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| unfunded mandates that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| awesome that Larson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| Representative Larson actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| said that a change in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| BEP formula because they always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| it's always stated at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| state level that they fully fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| public education but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| untrue some untruths to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| they fund it but not to it's full capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| because they do give these unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| mandates one of them being RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| at every level and it's particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| I mean I can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| and on to a soapbox about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| but when you think about this opioid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| problem that we have particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| in Knox County we try to combat this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| the last two years that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| kids that are coming into our system that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| don't even know they have challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| these NSA babies are part of this tier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| 1, 2, and 3 and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| it's an overload for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| so that you're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| you're paying out of your back pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| and they're taking out both of your front pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| just to give you an analogy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| about that so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| of asking for and making sure that you're supporting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| unfunded mandates are hopes that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| would get behind that because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| become strenuous for teachers in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| of one trying to have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| nurses taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| so it's a spiral effect you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| nurses trying to take care of kids that need medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| you got teachers trying to now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| teach these RTI things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| but they put in place about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| these unfunded mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| nurses and RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| and it's astronomical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| so I'm saying to you you are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| for it and we can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| we just can't afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| if you're our stewards you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| are actually money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| is just coming out of your pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| and the state needs to be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| that. Thank you that's kind of why I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| ask that clarifying. It sounds like these are head counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| in our system which we've had to add for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| and in order to keep them in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| sustainable position for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| this would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| and going back to my previous statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| you know our lanes are definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| anything related to the word funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| and the word funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| the lead off word here. I'm going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Commissioner Smith to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| and then I'm going to go back to Commissioner Jay just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| go ahead Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4314)|

| 1:12:28| it impacts all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| aspects of what teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| do in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4352)|

| 1:12:48| to our children right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| that has an impact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4370)|

| 1:13:02| funding based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I think we need to stick to 2, 3, 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4386)|

| 1:13:10| some different feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| about opposition to the school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| but without seeing how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| this thing is structured it could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| detrimental impacts on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| our basic schools are funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I think it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| be opposed to. I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| to support our school board on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4408)|
| 1:13:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4418)|

| 1:13:56| and then the other one is the opposition to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4438)|

| 1:14:02| on these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| You're asking about this BEP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| and it comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| tax payers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| we are a donor county too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| and if we're asking them to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| the funding and we're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| donor county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| does that not increase our liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| to other counties if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| increase that and take a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| away from our funding that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| coming back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| Don't know the answer to that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4478)|

| 1:14:42| The tax payer is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| that's really going to hit with it and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| talking about the tax payer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| that pays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| the tax and those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| private sector that generates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| a service or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| product that we tax as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| government to get ourselves to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| now how much is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| going to affect those tax payers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Charlie what we're talking about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| we have a surplus of nearly a billion dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| and we'd like to see the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| use some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| more of that towards education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| it too but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| we have not seen it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| past and I don't think we're going to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| in the future so before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| we go ahead and say we want this increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| in taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| of the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| which they generate that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| through the BEP from tax payers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| also are a donor county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| how is that going to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| the tax payers here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4544)|

| 1:15:50| that out we need to get a clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| of what the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| amount is if we get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| increase how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| more are we going to have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4558)|

| 1:16:36| directly from the source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Point number two real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| when it comes to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| priorities I think we're still trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| narrow in on it I'd like to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| this body to focus on numbers 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| 3 and 4 and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| number 5 right now that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| sticking to funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| those are three very specific funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| platforms but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| school voucher is a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| much bigger discussion with and we're not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| sure what is happening and what level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| and who's doing what and who's not doing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| and I think that gets us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| over our toes a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| before we even have that bigger discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| but 2 3 and 4 are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| specific related to funding and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| that we might specifically address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| again these are only suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| to our legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| so who knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| where any of this will go but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| those are very focused I would just focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| 2 3 and 4 that's just my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4650)|

| 1:18:14| needs it's directed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| and leaves bigger burden on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| the existing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| so it does affect funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| ok I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| could you go back are you talking about the vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| you brought up the RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| 2 3 4 and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Commissioner Skinmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| I agree with Commissioner Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| the voucher deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| will come down from the Governor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| that's going to be one of his priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| school districts across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| need to address that directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| I don't think at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| the county commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| should have that as one of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| legislative issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| needs to be dealt with between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| the Governor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| and the 136| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| school districts across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| I bet this is a hard one because it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| discussed in the terms of politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| for years here in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| and that one strikes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| as sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| in my opinion sometimes we need to work harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| to find ways to get more private dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| into public education than worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| public dollars going into private education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| you know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| I think I mentioned that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| great schools partnership recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| that's one of our greatest challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| is you know how do we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| more private dollars into public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| stressing over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| public going into private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| you know the three ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| related to funding I said before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| began the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| those struck me as the cleanest ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| I mean one option that we have too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| is to endorse this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| entire list too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I mean that might be getting a little bit out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| wheelhouse but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| my take is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| just keep it to those three that have the word funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| in it just because that would be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| what I said at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4828)|
| 1:20:36| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| anyhow what I'll do as chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| I think what I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| summarize sort of what I've heard as it relates to this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| one, two, three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| and four, have we already voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| all three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I want to look at Madam Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| this is kind of off the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| we're not voting to pass anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| but I know we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| two and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I'm just going to do a vote of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| just to add these on to this official list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| and of course this commission discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| that we're having right now can take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| with our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| this very discussion that we're having right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| as it's related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| but go ahead Commissioner Jay you had your light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I think we voted on number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| two which would be funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| number four which would be funding of school nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| positions I don't believe that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| whether to add funding of RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| to positions after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| comments from Commissioner Gale so I think that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| we need to vote on before we get to number five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| okay I'll go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| is there for funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| RTI squared positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| all in favor please say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| all opposed please say nay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| all right there we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| there's three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| opposition to school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| all in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| please say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| all opposed please say nay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| or pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I gotta tell you I didn't hear enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| on that that wasn't clear enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| we can't do roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| yeah I mean I know this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| frankly I'm just trying to make the discussion a little bit easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| those three are on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| this one I'd say we can discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| with our once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| we'll put this on the table with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| let everyone know how we all feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| and move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| so those are the four things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| that have come up in our commission meeting and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| it's fair to share that with them when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| Mr. Osler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| the one about the vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| I think in your BEP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| it's a formula with the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| that you have in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| if you do a voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| and the voucher lets that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| go out of public school into a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| school it's no longer counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| as a part of the formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| because they go into the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| sector so the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| that you get out of the public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| the more funding the state will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| under their present BEP formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| you're increasing the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| of students that are eligible for BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and if you don't increase taxes statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| that number per student will go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| so basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| if you're voting for the voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| what are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| well what I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| is I want to go back to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Commissioner Jay said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| we've got the statewide expert on BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| funding that's going to be here with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| joint committee this Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| what time was that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| 4pm at the Andrew Johnson building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| I would strongly encourage all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| to come to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| to get a deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| overview on how the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| calculates BEP and all the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| that we're asking ourselves right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| at this meeting right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| are questions that we can probably put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| to become better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| more informed commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| but the big formula for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| still having my light on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| is the number of students we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| in the public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| that's the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| part where we get our funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| vote on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| are we voting plus for the voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| or are we voting negative against the voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| in the statement we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| are we supporting vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| or are we not supporting vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| I mean I haven't heard anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| contact me in support of vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| but well I think the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| would be or not the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| the discussion would be who's opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| to the school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| who's opposed to school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| if we leave it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| the state well never mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| leave it on the we have fought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| this for I don't know how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| against vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| not to have vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| we keep it laying out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| and it's going to jump up and bite us one of these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| I'll go with Commissioner Gilt then Smith then Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| thank you Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| because the large BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| formula is calculated by the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| so even at the joint education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| she will explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| that that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| will be reduced as students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| exit public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| the funding follows the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| so that will be a subtraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| in our column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| and I think the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| whether we leave it on a statewide level or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| is the funding formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| for Knox County school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| vouchers directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| impact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| and we are going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| as a body a funding body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| decide which side of the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| we're going to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| this isn't sitting on a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| this is a decision to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| the needs of Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| to say in their resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| as with our strong support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| that we do not support vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| ok and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| like the point she just made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| about the funding follows the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| but it goes in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| some of those schools have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| certain guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| that they have to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| and if the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| does not follow those formulas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| the student doesn't stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| in that school and wants to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| to the public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| then we have to fund that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| coming back in to the public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| from the private schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| but you don't get the money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| and most religious based schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| are tax exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| then you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| then drill down to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| the type of students they accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| whether they are students with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| disabilities, students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| have issues of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| associated with where you attend school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| but we really have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| if we're dealing with the issue of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| where we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| because we're going to be paying for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Alright, Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Thank you Mr. Chair, I'll make one last statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| then I think we need to get back to the local issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| the county commission body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| list that we're seeing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| these are last year's priorities from the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| they have not voted on their legislative agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| yet, in fact the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| they have voted on is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| to oppose vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Alright, that's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| does this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| do we know if the school board is going to be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| to update their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| before that meeting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| I'm looking at Commissioner Gill or Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| They have not given us that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| I would assume that they will but I'm not going to speak for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| They meet Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| They meet, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| So we're within a couple of days of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| the school board is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| So they are going to be meeting to draft that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| to get their final list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| We could get a vote on the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Yeah, I mean we could do a vote on the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| which I think might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I mean once we get their final list, I get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| That seems most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| appropriate to finalize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Alright, moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| You can have a copy of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| It was in the email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| So you can make that a part of the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Alright, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Moving on to more local issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| We've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| We've got to finalize our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| specific issues that we're going to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| Alright, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Brad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| We've got the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| I'm looking at some of the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Commissioner Anders had originally posted on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| The growth plan, we may need a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| act to allow for Knox County to set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| a qualified plan for future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Planning Commission structure and operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| giving Knox County permission to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Funding for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| BEP formula or change to formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Unfunded mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I think we need something to be a little bit more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| pulling out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| So what the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| would like to see would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| for the sake of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| purposes, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| members of the body could put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| succinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| nominations of things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| could recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| I know the growth plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Commissioner Smith, you and I discussed this at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I believe that Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Daniel was working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| some verbiage as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| to a private act for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| to get the proper verbiage as it relates to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| is that something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| we actually had that on our agenda last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| but it did not go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| so that seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| as something that we may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| put back on our list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Randy, I mean, what's y'all's take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| I'm looking around here, I'm seeing none heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| so I want to get some feedback on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| You know, we need to find a legislator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| to carry this to the national force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| We need to make sure that our legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| delegation and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| legislative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| follow through with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| association and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| everybody's on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| I don't think the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| I think where we got a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| sideways last year was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| we had other counties try to come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| to our bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| because they suddenly realized they didn't like their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| growth plan either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| but I think the best thing to do is we try to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| this as a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| I mean, how would that look? Would that look like us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| passing a simple resolution as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| private act and then letting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| with a recommended bill and having someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| carry that, like if Representative Daniel wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| He got involved in it but it was late in the season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| last year and didn't have time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| make that difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| We actually had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| the gentleman from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| not the county association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| the other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Tennessee County Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Yes, show up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| speak against it because he wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| aware that we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| support for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| and after speaking with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| after the meeting and giving him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| the minutes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| where our director of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| came before us and said that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| thought that it was best to do away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| two because it hinders MPC and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| ability to long range plan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| areas. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| think we're going to have any problem with it this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| as long as we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| our fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| that are down there and part of these active committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| making sure everybody's aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| and we get with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| legislator a lot earlier than we did last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| Alright, how would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| we're drafting this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| or once again these will be discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| but we've got to give our folks something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| a bullet point or something to walk away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I mean is this going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| worded, alright thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| Commissioner Busler, I'll make my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| statement then I'll call on Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| Is it going to look like a simple one line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| we'd like to see a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| act or tell them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| pass a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| authorizing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Knox County to set a plan for future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| per whatever resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| we get passed, something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| And eliminating the current growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Yeah, and eliminating the current growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Alright, Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| We have one of our body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| members here that knows about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| what we were trying to do that's down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| now, Mr. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Representative Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| What we need to do is we need to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| because last time that this went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| it came from about two different directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| and nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| knew what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| and the Senate bill that went through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| they didn't even know what they were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| so you'll have to have a Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| House does it, then the Senate has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| go ahead and pass their Senate bill along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| with it, so you have to have those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| parties, you have one in each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| House that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| knows what's going on so they can explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| it when it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| in that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| and we've got to find out which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| committee it will be going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| and who's on that committee and who we need to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| to get it to go on, to come out of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| to get to the floor, to get voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| and that's what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| didn't do, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I don't know what we were trying to do last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| I thought it was kind of dead and all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| it popped up and we really need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| know everybody in here that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| down there that talks to our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| so we go in there and say this is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I didn't even know what was going about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| we talked about it here and then somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| sent it down there without letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| the rest of us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| and we could have probably got it through last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| so let's do a little bit better of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| on what we're doing and you've got a draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| that you could almost piggyback on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| rewrite it, have somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| in the House do it and then get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| to the Senate and explain to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| so you've already got the bill pretty much written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Where is a copy of that draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| What I might ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| is if we've got a copy of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| to get that to the commission office and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| get that out to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| I'm not sure if it was Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| I thought Martin was Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| I mean it's probably in our inbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| it's not at the top of my inbox right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| it's probably part of the record from the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| but I'd love to get a copy of that bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| and just make that one of our discussion points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| We're going to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| I'm seeing nodding heads so we'll make this one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| ideas on the local take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| unless I hear somebody say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| let's make this one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| the very bland unfunded mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| Commissioner Anders added funding for BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| which we've just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| the planning commission structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| and operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| giving Knox County permission to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| if needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I think that's a bill we've been hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| some discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Scott Davis has talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| we've been hearing that within the MPC world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| the potential of splitting the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| I'm not sure where that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| in terms of a bill going through Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| but I'm curious if this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| wants to weigh in on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Go ahead Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| I know but is there any energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| behind it outside of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| so what are y'all hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| and is that something we'd want to weigh in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5774)|
| 1:36:22| I would want to weigh in on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| That's what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| I'm calling on you to share your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I think we need to look at this seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| we look at the other large metro areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| around us, they have different systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| it is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| to the growth of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| and the ability to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| our destiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| and I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| as much control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| over the structure of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| now I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| control over MPC but the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| of it to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| that we're able to make the right decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| for the people of Knox County moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| I mean if it's such a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| why didn't the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| just become part of our MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| insight on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| As I'm trying to pull together all of our thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| and discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Commissioner Anderson said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| we're really not ready to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| we're not set up, we've not looked at how to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| how to structure it or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| but if all you're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| is the option, you don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| have an exact plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| there's no sense in planning to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| until you know you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| I would agree with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| and I think the option of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| of MPC better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| to look at some of the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| growth and opportunities in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| we must have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| handle on what that is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| and at this point we are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| at a disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| and I think we need to begin to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| not only 3, 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| 15 and 20 years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| the language of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| dealing with really needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| we really need a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| conversation about where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| to be. We may not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| where we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| in the land, but we need to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| to look at where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| larger issues of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| are going to be. And we're struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| at this point, but I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| an opportunity for us right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| now to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Kind of what I'm hearing and what I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| is do we need to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| changes, yes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| right now we don't even know what it would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| we haven't had a chance to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| we don't know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| we're going with this. And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| that I want to use the cliche from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| of summer study, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| is this something that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| establish a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| subcommittee on and study it more here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| at the commission level and research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| before we make a recommendation or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| something that we would see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| our legislators in Nashville could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| behind something that would kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| get past that would then allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| to make changes down the road. It might be 2 or 3 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| down the road before we figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| a different structure that this body may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| want to move on with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I mean, it's not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| in 6 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| That strikes me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| the right way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| But once again, I would be curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| you know, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| have the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| of MPC will be here at 7. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| is he already here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Okay. Sorry, Gerald, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| You're kind of out of my line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| But why don't you come on up here? I mean, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| about this. This affects your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| I'd be curious just to get your thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| He was hiding so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Laughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| And name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Gerald Green, director of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| and Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| I'd like to pick up on what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Gill said, you know, the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| to identify where we're going 3, 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| 15, 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| And that ties into the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| We don't need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| throw away our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| well, we need to revise our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| of where we're going and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| seriously at where we want the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| to go, how we want to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| the tools that may be available that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| aren't hindered by the existing growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| plan to give us another plan for direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| planner. I look at things in broad picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| and I look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| planning commission, the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| that's able to look at things broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| The city is part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| I pay city and county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Looking at it from that perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| is good. 90%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| items that come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| are consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| or unanimous or close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| The conversation between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| the different appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| is very good in arriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| at a decision. People bring different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| perspectives. One of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| has been that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| appointees seem to be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| development oriented. Well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| next appointee from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| is a developer, so I think people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| who make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| are hearing that and you're getting a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| representation across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| I'm open to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| interpretations there and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| can look at how it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| but study it. But I think more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| important is updating our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| plan for growth and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| in the county so that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| the direction and we also look at tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| that we can use to get to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| What I'm hearing you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| and I'm going to call on Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| because he hasn't spoken yet, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| I'll get to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Your main focus would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| let's get this plan done first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| I don't want to quite say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| low-hanging fruit, but that is the low-hanging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| fruit on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| I think it's the fruit that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| most right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| It's pretty high up, but it's most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| right. Okay. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Thank you. Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| so basically what we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| right now is with all the pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| and things of that nature, that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| split MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| the county had a better say, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| with that, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| some of the pilots and things could go out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| county so we could be more attractive to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| larger companies to bring bigger, better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| paying jobs here. Is that kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| We're not at all involved in the pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| And I think what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| takes is something beyond, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| way beyond MPC. It takes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| law director's department, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| commission, some legislation to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| discussed that we need some incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| to attract development to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| commercial centers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| I'm a true believer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Commercial nodes throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| are conveniently located to the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| How do we arrive at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Those are questions we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| It may not take a change in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| organization of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| planning commission or the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| but we need to identify those tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| First, say that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| we want to do. Identify some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| where they would likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| be appropriate, and then how do we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| And that's all part of updating our growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| plan and getting a better direction on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| growth and development in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| But there's different language in the city than there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| within the county, correct? All the way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| codes, all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Would it help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| to have better representation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Well, not better representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Something more honed in for the county that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| people that are there make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| good decisions, given the tools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| they have. I think you've hit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| the right thing, the tools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| We have an updated zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| we have standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| and the city is updating theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| I think one of the goals I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| identified is taking some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| work that has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| for the city zoning code update and applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| it to the county, allowing residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| or mixed use in our commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| looking at more dense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| opportunities. I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| to, again, identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| where we want to go, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| apply those tools that will get us there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| implement them. So kind of like a re-code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| but for the county? For the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| I know I'll kick myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| out for even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| suggesting that, but I do think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| update our standards so that they're more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| in tune with the type of development we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| to do and better direct it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| then Anders. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| So, Mr. Green, are you saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| the county would be better off if the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| of Farragut did away with their MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| If the town of Farragut what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Did away with their Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| No, I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| at all. I'm just saying I think we have an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| that's working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We need to address, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| than the organization, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| need to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| growth plan and the tools that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| have or don't have to direct and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| manage growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Okay. How do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| answer the question to those that say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| like who the city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| has appointed and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| live in the county, you have no influence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| I think you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| the influence by talking to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| And I believe the mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| given the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| the new appointees are taking with the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| and new appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| I think that message has been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Okay. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| when we have ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| that come down through the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| that require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| sidewalks within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| subdivisions in the county that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| our legislative branch had no say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| so in, is that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| proper way for things to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I feel that legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| needs to be made by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I think, now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| I'll take the other part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Are sidewalks something that's needed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| county as the county becomes more urban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| And I think we hear that from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| We see more developments coming in with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| without the requirement that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Are there developments that don't need sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| or shouldn't put them in? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| And we need to be able to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| based on some criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| which ones are most appropriate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| sidewalks and which ones are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you, Mr. Green. I also want to avoid us going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| a sidewalk discussion when we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| get our stuff cleared away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| How hard will it be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| to have MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| that are, and we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| have to update our codes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| zoning in the county too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| How hard will it be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| have to master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| two very different sets of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| We have that now. The city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| codes are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| They're not as different as they're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| probably still it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| variation on the difference in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| codes, and that's one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| challenges is the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| and the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| commissioners and the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Look at where we can update the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| county code, as I stated, to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| mixed uses, more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| more opportunities for flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| and development so that they become more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| separating the commission will make the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| any greater. I think maybe having one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| commission that can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| those and see how they can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| better and be more similar, better not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| only for the commissioner, commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| itself, but also for the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| in the community so they don't have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| different sets of standards depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| what side of a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| line they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| biggest problem you see with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| splitting the two bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| splitting the body into two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I think just losing that perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| countywide perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| because the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| loss, the conversation that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| look beyond a small lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| and look in a larger lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| because stormwater doesn't stay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| one side of a political line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| traffic doesn't stay on one side of a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| line, the impacts of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| growth and development doesn't stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| on one side of a political boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Okay, that kind of goes to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| The city wants to die at streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| We haven't been able to say so over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| try to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| Our zoning meeting starts in 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| I'm going to call on Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| I do have one...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| I'm sorry, it's Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| All right, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I'm just going to ask some questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Years ago, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Easttown Mall was being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| built, we thought that that was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| the greatest thing since sliced bread, since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| already had Westtown. Now it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| shutting down, and even you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| away from big box stores and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| things like that, which you're going to have to redevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| When we look in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| there's going to be a lot more redevelopment going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| on of existing properties, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| looking at how land's going to be used and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| the best way it's going to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| and our mode of traffic is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| change. We're not going to have Fords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| and Chevrolets anymore. There may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Amazons or Googles or whatever, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| if you don't own it, you just rent it for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| time that you need it, and when you travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| it'll be a different way. Now that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| in the future, but right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| we're still looking at what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| last year and the year before last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| and all like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| and that's the way we're planning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| and I don't know how we can predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| the future because technology is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| changing so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| Everything is changing so quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| and we've got to develop in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| to where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| redo, redevelop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| these things we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| and I don't know how we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| answer the question. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| going to have to be, what do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| think it's going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| What will it be, and what will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| Some of the things that are coming in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| just boggle our minds now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| We never thought we could be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| in the modes of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| and where we want to live and how we want to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and how the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| but the public needs certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| They need a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| that they want to do their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| exercise, whether they want to walk up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| sidewalks or walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| a wooded area and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Those are things we have to preserve, but they're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| individuality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| and we will be developing communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| and not cities, is what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| When we develop those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| we will have to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| to get those communities what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| within those communities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| There again is the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| how do we develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| a development like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| the MPC to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| this, not just right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| now, but so far out in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| it would boggle your mind of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| it's going to look, and how can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| develop and plan to where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| redo redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| and things like we will have to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Easttown Mall we're having to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| What I'd like to do is get us back on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| But that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| How is that going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| translate into telling our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| legislators exactly what to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| vote on? I want to get us really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| tight on specific points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| that we want our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| to support when we have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| with them that I don't want us to go in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| long conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| because we're only going to have an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| And a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| answer to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Busseler's question is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| updating our growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| and looking at development trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| and working with the community to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| what the community wants, all part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| process of updating our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| And still having my light on is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| the cities look at right now that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| a different way than we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| undeveloped land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Now how are we going to get the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| ideas together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| if we have the same committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| working on two different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| it just doesn't seem like it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| So you're in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| splitting MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| What I'd like to do, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| jump to one other item we have not talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| that I think might be something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| may want to ask our folks in Nashville to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Commissioner Smith had put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| this on the forum and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| I just want to bring this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| His line was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| we need to ask our legislators to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| internet sales tax collection includes local sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| and is distributed back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| want to, this could have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| local impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| John, I think you mentioned it briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| when we brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| As it's pertaining specifically to local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| sales tax in this, that's a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| different than making it a pure state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| This has all come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| from the South Dakota versus Wayfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| internet presence rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| and it's now legal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| bodies to collect sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| tax from internet retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| That could have a fairly sizable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| and two levels, state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| revenue that would get pushed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| and local sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| getting collected. So there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| different sides to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| It may be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| that as we look through some of the easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| communicate things that they may want to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| away with out of a meeting with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| that this may be something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| noticed that struck me as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| that may want to get a little more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| information. By the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| we will start our zoning meeting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| 7. The agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| is not very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| deep and we can come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| this discussion after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| I just want to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| some closure on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| so that, remember, we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| an awful lot of things here, but ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| we're discussing these things so we can be productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| when we meet with our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| on Friday morning, the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| With that said, John, you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| at me like you're about to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| but I did bring back up this sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| tax collection issue. This is something we may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| to specifically lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| Possibly. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| the state is going to have to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| this year whether to join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| streamline sales and use tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| agreement. Currently there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| 23 states in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| that are full members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| We are the only state that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| associate member. And so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| state legislature is going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| convince the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| of Revenue that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| way to go. And then from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| that step, once they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| that done, that will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| the money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| flow through to Tennessee a little bit easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| than it is now. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| possibly then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| local taxes can be collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| by point of delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| So it's just going to be, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| they need to get their act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| in Nashville done first to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| to move from an associate member to a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| I guess my point is if we're thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| something that could in turn have local impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| down the road, that's a fairly easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| thing. I'm just looking at all the things we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| discussed. That's an easy thing also that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| can agree on that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| easy to communicate to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| Especially with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| intended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| after that of being able, once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| get the state level collections, to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| systematically add in the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| options to that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| And then they'll have to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| the Department of Revenue will have to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| their formula for the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=6983)|
